I have I phone 8 +. Does not fit and they won‚Äôt let me fill in the return product info to send it back.

I ordered this for my sister that loves anything pink‚Ä¶what a total miss. This case is nowhere close to the item pictured. The listing shows a very pink sparkling case. What was received was a rose gold sparkling case.  Not pink. My sister waited weeks to get this and now she is so upset. I gifted her a new phone for Christmas and she wouldn‚Äôt use it because she didn‚Äôt have a case to protect it. Now she has an ugly case she doesn‚Äôt like at all but wants to start using her phone. Sure she could go to Walmart and buy a cheap case but she wouldn‚Äôt be any happier so she is just gonna use it until I can find her something else. Please don‚Äôt waste your money on this ‚Äúpink‚Äù case.  Update your item description please.

I did really like this case easy to slip phone into & beautiful but it has an inner layer that is sparkly & it‚Äôs cracking & splitting all around the corners & now it doesn‚Äôt look good so I‚Äôll probably be returning it.

Item size Description is incorrect. It is too small for my iPhone.

I had to return the phone case because I was not able to plug in the charging cable. You have to remove the phone case in order for the charging cable to fit. I am not sure if this case is compatible with a wireless charging connection.

The product came bent and I sent it back

Doesn‚Äôt fit properly. Can‚Äôt plug in charging cable - it just pops right out! Button alignment is so poor that you can‚Äôt turn off the phone!The case is beautiful and my mom is really disappointed that we have to return it.

I bought this case for my daughter phone and was totally disappointed when she dropped her phone in school and the front of her phone screen shattered. This case is not durable or sturdy enough.

This is the third time I have purchased an IPhone SE case where the description stated the case fit the phone.  All three times the case has been too small.

I cant use the case because I have to remove the case every time I want to charge my phone. The part where the charger goes Needs to be larger so it can fit the charger. Cannot use.

Be warned, this doesn't come with a cover - a dealbreaker for me, because I want my phone protected...I don't recommend this, there are plenty that include a cover!

We had the case on for 2 days, my phone slid off my lap and fell on my carpet. My phone cracked! Do not buy this case!

I love the look of this case so much. It‚Äôs sparkly and a perfect pastel purple. Unfortunately, it did not protect my case. I dropped my phone on my wood floor and my screen shattered. I was shocked. I‚Äôve done similar with my other case and nothing happened. This case just doesn‚Äôt have enough substance to it. I bought a new screen and a stronger case. Lesson learned.

I love the looks of this case!!!  However, I was so disappointed when I tried to plug in my charger cord. The hole in the case does not allow the cord to fit correctly. It simply won‚Äôt work. I can‚Äôt use it. So disappointing.

Super cute, but you can‚Äôt charge your phone with this case on! The plug in iPhone chargers wont fit while the case is on your phone. I was so bummed, I loved the look. Just wish it was functional!

Bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. The inside plastic is already cracked in three places! I would return it but I had a gymnastics logo printed on the exterior by a friend.

It is super cute but the charging cord will not plug in while this case is on. Will be returning.

This was very crappy and not sturdy whatsoever. It was way too loose on my phone which was a shame because it looks super pretty in person. Too bad it is too big and won‚Äôt protect my phone at all.

Very pretty and all other holes work except the charger hole, hence have to pull it out of the case to charge. I am lazy and want to just plug it in.

The case overlaps the charger so I can‚Äôt charge with it

I was disappointed with this case. When I opened it, the inside rim was damaged in 2 places. I sent it back and was refunded right away.

On the website it looks like a blueish turquoise - when I received my order it was grassy green. Good thing it was cheap...

Beautiful cover, but very slippery. Honestly not sure how it holds up because I ended up getting an otter box because I‚Äôm a Kluz. üòâ

Does not protect the phone at all, i was given the correct size for my iPhone 8 & it‚Äôs loose & literally my phone  fell out of the case when i dropped my phone.

it looks like the picture, but it doesnt fit my phone. very disappointed.. scratches easy too not that that bothers me. its a very pretty case tho!edit: forgot to mention it came scratched

Case is no good....  put it on phone and a week later all the corners are cracked!

The charging cord port is hard to plug into with this case. Other than that I like it

Its super cheap. Its a removable piece of glitter paper placed into a pink tinted clear phone case.

It went in garbage. It wouldn‚Äôt let me charge. And threw away shipping papers. Was pretty though

Dropped phone, case did not protect it. Will never buy again.

Dislike because it‚Äôs too light & flimsy but like the glitter look.

After 1 month I took my phone out and the back of my phone is shattered! Don‚Äôt buy.

All the sparkle on the back rubbed off in less then a week.

The color is beautiful, but it began to look flawed within 24 hours. Now it looks good from far away but the glitter has blotchy spots of no glitter that are very noticeable close up.

Not @ all what the picture looks like.

The case is beautiful but turns brown after a month of use, it looks dirty even though I keep it clean!

Wrong description had to return

Case easily slides off edges of phone, doesn‚Äôt fit securely.

Didnt fit on my iphone 8, fits on an iphone 6s. Very unhapppy

Awful. Too big for phone. Screen cracked immediately when dropped

Wouldn't fit my phone?

It was to small for my iPhone 8

Too small. Not as described

The phone came but the charger was missing

My phone will break if dropped with this. Junk

I wish I could rate this zero stars, but one star will just have to do. They say this phone case ‚Äúprotects‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just for show. The case is cheaply-made, it‚Äôs just a clear case with a glittery paper glued unto it, so you can remove it anytime or even make this case at home yourself! When my phone fell, it broke on impact (as seen in the attachments above), and that was only from one fall. Think twice before buying this garbage. You‚Äôre better off buying a better quality clear phone case and DIYing it, just getting a plain but sturdy case, or purchasing one that is guaranteed to work.

We tried ordering this two separate times and both times the case says it's for iphone 8 plus but it is not even close to fitting the iphone 8 plus.

I do not know what phone this cover is supposed to fit but it is nearly 1/3 bigger than my i phone 7 I am very unhappy about this as its not worth time  to return it

Pretty phone case online.  But in person, the glitter was just a piece of glitter paper inside of the plastic case.  The paper wasn't even glued into the case.  Ended up returning.

The glitter came off immediately

I bought this case in red. I love the color and sparkle effect. It fits my phone snugly but the hole for the charger does not line up perfectly with the port, so I need to stretch the edge of the case or slip it off the phone to charge. I will not return it though because it is so pretty and just deal with the inconvenience.

I was so excited to order these! Unfortunately, I did not see results & my under eye bags are not that bad. They do feel good especially if you keep them in the fridge & they are moisturizing. However I did not get any results from them. üòû

Nice case, but my wife can‚Äôt plug in any cord to charge it. Too thick of base. Makes it worthless

Too slippery

I ordered the pink one in June of 2022. Instantly fell in love with the light pink sparkly case. It was awesome until months later I noticed the pink was fading. It‚Äôs now at 9 months later, a putrid peach and I‚Äôm disappointed. It‚Äôs held up to many drops and protected my phone. It still feels nice. Just the color has faded üòû

You can see on the photo that the opening for the charger is not centered on the charging port.  This causes tightness on the top of the charging cord and off brand charging cords are too thick to fit in the slot.  Or they will fit for a minute and you will return to a dead phone, because the case will have pushed the charging cord out of the port.  Otherwise the case is cute and seems to protect the phone.  Good for the price, but not compatible with many charging cords.

i bought this thinking it would protect my phone, and it was stylish. I dropped it once and it cracked across my screen. i'm dissatisfied and disappointed. i wish i could say it actually worked for what it was supposed to.

I used this case for approximately two months, while using my phone daily. I ended up throwing it away because where my hands rested became discolored - I've never had this issue with any other phone cases so I was grossed out! Additionally my popsocket base started to peel off very quickly. I suspect it was due to the type of plastic the case is made of, as I've never had issues with the adhesive previously. Not going to buy this brand of case again.

Didn‚Äôt fit phone

The color and glitter was perfect but the case is very thin and flimsy. Plastic so flexible it easily bends. I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt protect my phone if dropped plus my lightening charger didn‚Äôt fit in the port to charge my phone so I switched back to my old case. Was hoping it was similar to a Speck but it definitely was not!

I got the mint green protective case and it was beautiful.  However, within about 3 months the practice around the edges began to turn yellow.  If you are not picky then you should be fine but if you expect it to look like the one on the photo it will not with time.

This case does not fit the iPhone 7 like every other case I have purchased for my iPhone 7. It does not fit snug at the bottom of the case, there's about a 3mm space between the bottom of the case and the iPhone where the case does not meet  up and there is a gap

I was so excited to receive this case but am very disappointed in how it fits.  It fits great at the top and the bottom of the phone but is very loose on the sides...almost as if it is stretched out.  ? The color and gradient glitter is perfect and exactly what I was looking for but will not be using since it doesn‚Äôt fit well.

Bought this for my daughter and she loved it. She‚Äôs only had it for less than 3 months and it‚Äôs already falling apart. The inside hard sparkly lining is cracking and the bottom of the case is all warped and barely covers the bottom of the phone.

I thought it was a hard textured case but the case  was flimsy and the color was not bight red

Can not charge my phone with the case on üò©üò© but besides that I love the color and easy to hold and durable

I love these phone cases but the ‚Äòblue‚Äô I ordered is not what I got. I either got a completely different color (mint green) or this definition of blue is totally skewed.

Received open boxed, broken/damaged from the side, poor quality, color doesn‚Äôt match to the one in the pictures.

Cheap case, the glitter is a piece of paper.  I was trying to avoid this from reviews and somehow missed this info.  I didn‚Äôt open the case until the return window passed.

Overall cute. But not very protective. Hard to charge with the lightning charger with the case on

The case is super pretty and glittery just how i like it. The only problem that i hate is that it so loose..

Started cracking and the clear part and the part aren‚Äôt even attached. Pretty crappy phone case all in all.

Very disappointed. Sent this case to Ukraine for my niece and it was wrong size.

Wrong size I have a smaller phone I have iphone8

My charger cord won‚Äôt fit through the case to charge

Beautiful colors, but 1 month after purchase it began turning yellow.

Don‚Äôt really like it

Not very protective

Colour doesn‚Äôt match what is advertised. Everything else is fine.

When you go to remove the phone case -.. the gold insert tries to come off separately.

The case is pretty but it just doesn't fit on the phone well. Getting it on and off is a major struggle and you'll be doing that frequently as you can't charge your phone with the case on.

It does the trick for being sparkly however it‚Äôs is very clear that it‚Äôs a material in there because on the corners you can see it is cut to fit

My 8 year old daughter loves this case but she is unable to charge her phone with the case on. The opening for the charger plug is too small. We have tried many types of chargers but can‚Äôt find one mail enough.

The colour and sparkles are nice, so it's a keeper. It fits a little loose on the 3rd Gen SE, but I'm OK with that. I doubt it's going to fall off! I'll update if I find it loosens up any more or if the looseness causes any problems getting in and out of pockets.I bought it because this SE has a known issue with the ringer button flipping to the off position too easily. Getting a case is the perfect solution because it forces the button to be recessed enough that it doesn't catch on things. This case does the job just fine.The material has a cheap quality to it - I anticipate it tearing within the first year. Hence the 3-star rating.

My daughter complains that she has to take the case off to charge her phone. But she loves the pink sparkles.

Love the color, but I have to remove the cover to charge.

My daughter loves this phone case, it‚Äôs very pretty and so far seems sturdy. I say it‚Äôs not practical because the charging cord doesn‚Äôt fit. She has to peel back the bottom of the case to charge it, which is quite frustrating. We can‚Äôt do wireless because she uses a popsocket which gets in the way. Will probably return and get a different case.

This glittery red case is 100% better in person and shimmers and sparkles beautifully with a micro glitter. The case is made of two parts, but goes on as one piece. While it is sturdy and pretty, the charging port is partially obscured and makes using the lightening charger a bit of a pain as it has to be moved. Not cool. If that were fixed this case would be perfect.

I like it except the hole for the cable connection is wonky -- have to lift the lip up a bit to get the cord in.I may need to carve out some of the plastic with a knife -- is super annoying.

This case doesn‚Äôt seem overly protective and it is difficult to get the charging cord in. It‚Äôs OK for the price and I will keep it for now, but really should have ordered something a little more sturdy.

This was such a cute case, but it was not protective at all. I'm pretty clumsy and dropped my phone a few times, and didn't notice right at first but one day when I happened to take off my case, I realized the whole back of my phone was shattered and also that the case itself was cracked. I still kept it on for a few more months after that but wish it would have held up longer.

I like the style and I like the color, but what I didn‚Äôt like was that it did not come with a cover for the front ,because break the glass plastic cover does not protect it when you drop it , it still cracks your screen.

Love this case, the only downside is that the hole where you plug in the charger is slightly off, so if I don't get it in just right my phone can't charge.

This is a beautifully sparkly case. Fits perfectly. Extends past surface protecting front of phone slightly.I didn‚Äôt like that this is a clear case with a cut piece of craft paper inside giving it the glitter effect. I expect it to be glitter infused silicone.  You can see the cuts around each edge to make the paper wrap around the corners of the case/phone. Kind of looks homemade and cheesy.

I didn‚Äôt like the fact that it was not sparkly,like it said in the description. I ordered the red one. It looks boring.

I‚Äôve had this product for a little over two weeks and the sparkly part of the case is already peeling off of the inside of the case. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs supposed to do that? But it still looks cute either way. I just won‚Äôt be taking off the case to make sure it stays in place.

This phone case is super cute but the phone charger wouldn‚Äôt stay in. It would keep falling out. I ordered another case had no problem with the charger staying put.

So very pretty fit pretty well... (I phone7) I've dropped the phone once or twice no issue...My only complaint is the case it not actually glitter.. there is a very well cut (plastic-ish ) paper in between the two layers of this case that gives it the glitter..  Also not a real lip on it (over the phone face)... just FYI as I know that is a thing for a lot of people.

I love the sparkle, but I‚Äôm disappointed that this cover is starting to yellow after only a short time.

I bought this case because I wanted a sparkly blue phone case, and I was not disappointed in that respect. However, the case is pretty loose on the phone. Whenever I pull it out of my pocket or the side pocket in my purse the case has come off the edge some. It also doesn't feel like it's incredibly protective, I don't drop my phone a lot, so this is a good case for style, but it definitely won't be my everyday case.

The case is nice very nice! The reason why I am giving it three stars is because I got the wrong color I order the gold one and I received the silver one. I know I could‚Äôve returned it I just didn‚Äôt wanna have my phone any longer without a case.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the description of glitter ‚Äúembedded‚Äù in the plastic. It is actually a piece of glittery paper between two thin plastic cases. I guess there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that except it gives the impression that the product is of a higher quality than it is.

The case itself is nice and exactly as pictured, but not a great fit for the iPhone 7. It‚Äôs not snug, and gaps a bit in integral areas where you really want protection. If you‚Äôre only concerned about aesthetics, then this is a good choice. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for any true phone protection, especially if the phone is dropped.

It arrived several days late. The case was too small for my iPhone 8, and both the description and box said the case was for 7/8. I had to return it. The case was pretty though.

Ok but not so cute once it yellows out

It's very slippery and I drop my phone all the time now because there is no grip or friction. I do like the color and the sparkles. Even though it slips out of my hands all the time, my phone has not cracked. So there's that. üòÜ

My daughter really likes the look of the case but I am not happy with the way is holds the phone. Not a very good safe case, only good for looks.

Nice case. Durable and very pretty, but it doesn't cooperate well with being on the charging cord. Have had to trim into the case to make it charger friendly.

was a bit disappointed at the color.  The packaging says purple but it's more of a pink.  Still pretty

The charging part isn‚Äôt big enough to fit a charger, had to crack it to fit mine.

It‚Äôs a pretty case, but after only a month, the back looks dirty where it‚Äôs held, and I can‚Äôt get it clean (and it‚Äôs not bc my hands are dirty.

Very average case. It‚Äôs honestly just a case. It‚Äôs super flimsy and won‚Äôt do much to protect your phone.

Deceiving color

It doesn‚Äôt seem like the case has enough of a raised edge to protect the front of the phone when dropped.

Got so yellow after few months!

Just wrong size!

MORE MAgenta color than the picture; fits iPhone 7 well

This case is ok

They liked it

If you have multiple chargers by different manufacturers this case, although very attractive, makes it next to impossible to charge your phone without sitting there holding the phone and pressing the cable jack into the charging port for the entire process to achieve proper contact.  The opening is either not quite large enough to accommodate all but the smallest of jacks (and even then) or the case opening has not been properly cut out to allow different chargers to fully connect.  I could only insert one out of my four jacks and that doesn‚Äôt work for me as they are spread out around the house where needed.So I will be returning it asap.

Overall ok with this purchase. Colours are nice. One issue I have with it though is that I have to remove the lower part of the case in order to charge it. The case interferes with the charging cord. I can only imagine doing this on a regular basis will lead to the case wearing out faster.

Looks and fits nice. BUT, the hole for the charger is too small! Very annoying to take the case off every time you have to charge.

I ordered a purple and a green case for my Iphone SE 2020 and they just arrived and I am kinda disappointed because I was expecting light pastel-like Seafoam Green Colour and a light pastel-like the pictures but they're both pretty dark. More like a Violet/Lilac purple and a Teal green. They do look nice and sparkly though.

The color is spot on and the glittery look is so cute! I bought this for my old iPhone 7 that I let my 9 year old play games on. It is flexible when off the phone but sturdy enough to take a little bit of drop shock. Doesn‚Äôt weigh down the phone at all. Very lightweight but very sturdy. Price point is really good for what you‚Äôre getting. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll see this case lasting forever, especially not in the hands of a kid, but it does seem like it could take a beating before it was a goner. Fits well to the phone but has enough give in it that you can still push the volume and power buttons. Not so stiff and hard that you can‚Äôt get to the buttons anymore. If you‚Äôre looking for something a little cheaper that will still do the job, this is a great option!

It‚Äôs very sparkly which is just what I wanted. I have a SE- it is a bit fiddly turning the ringer off and on but the charger and other buttons fit well.

The fit of the case is beautiful. The quality Is great! I‚Äôve bought this case before just in a different color, however the color of this case is a darker in person than I had anticipated. On Amazon, it looks like a light lilac purple, but in person it is definitely more of a deeper purple, however still like the case would definitely recommend!

I love the look of this case and I'm able to put a stick-on card holder on it. The only issue I have is the hole near the charging port is too small and not being able fit a charger when the case is on. I used an exacto knife to cut the outer piece of it off to make room for a charger and am happy with the case.

Disliked I could charge only if I took off case case was too thick for charger to fit so I cut one piece off fits perfect now but manufacturers should fix this problem

Definitely a decent phone case for the price. I have an iPhone SE from 2020 (the one with a Home button), and it fits it perfectly. I don‚Äôt use a screen protector or anything, but I really just needed SOMETHING around it, and wanted something cute (the purple glitter is adorable). However, the case does interfere with a regular charging cable - it felt like it wouldn‚Äôt plug in all the way, and it definitely would‚Äôve popped out and not charged my phone if I left it. Once I realized was the top rubber ridge squeezing the cable, I actually just cut it off at an angle (toenail clippers worked like a charm!). The manufacturers do need to make the opening wider, but (for now) as long as you don‚Äôt mind taking a minute to modify with some clippers, it‚Äôs solid for a $12 case!

Once you get the cover on your phone, the right side (with one button cover) is raised too high to where any level of grip with cause it to click and shut your phone down back to the homepage and even call 911 if you grip it long enough and not know that you're doing it.It's been really frustrating when I'm on social media and talking on the phone and my phone shuts the app and takes me back to the home page. Also, when I just grab my phone and not realize I'm holding down the button on the right side which triggers to call 911 if you hold it down too long. I've literally had to get some tools and remove the right button because it's raised too high and closes me out and triggers to call 911. So, they need to lower the height of the since button-cover on the right side.They also should make the cover fit better because it's pretty loose. I've only had it for a few weeks and it's pretty loose as well. Usually, covers are hard to put on because they fit so perfectly. Well, this one isn't because it's that loose and can also give you the impression that you're clicking the side buttons when you're not and want to. Other than that, I like it.

It‚Äôs a very pretty case and fits the iPhone SE well, but you have to take the case off in order to charge the device. A cord will not fit into the phone with this case on.

My daughter loves the color of this case and it fits great and seams to be pretty durable.

We had to replace my daughters cell phone right away as her newer iPhone got damaged and with her being out of state I told her to go into the carrier store that we use and just buy a cheap iPhone( we prefer to pay up front for our phones no huge payment plans) but, they didn‚Äôt have cases to fit. We looked all over the mall etc. and the one she bought kept putting pressure on the buttons for volume etc. I went on trusty Amazon and had her pick out ones she liked then read the reviews. This one had mostly great reviews and we needed it quickly. It works great, no issues with getting in the way of charging or pushing buttons. The only thing I would say is it‚Äôs not the most protective compared to some but, still does the job protecting it in most regular use issues. For every day typical activity this is a great buy.

It‚Äôs really pretty and protective but the case makes it really had to charge your phone. I end up taking the case off to charge

A little big but worked ok.

It‚Äôs a very pretty case and I like the material, but it interferes with charging; The cord keeps popping out. I‚Äôd still buy it again but they need to change the design a bit.

I bought this to replace my phone case, and I'm surprised at how well it protects my phone, especially since it's not a thick or hard type cover. The sparkle adds a little pizazz to my day as well!

This case is really nice, l love the vibrant color and glitter.  It's very durable and well made.  My only issue is that its a thicker case and my car charger won't fit into the phone.  The home charger works fine so this really isn't that big of an issue.

Easy to apply to the phone and has been a protective case, but difficult to plug your phone into a charger once the case is on.The opening for access to the charging port on the phone is not wide enough causing it to always get disconnected while charging or connected to my car. Stopping the music and gps connection while driving. Best to use charging pad with this case. It‚Äôs also a little more of a pink hue than purple. I thought it would be more like a lavender/lilac. Will probably be getting a different case soon.

This is a cute case but came really damaged so couldn't use it.

I have an iphone 7 and this case fits perfectly. It looks just like the picture. The lip on the face of the phone is crucial, when I've had cases in the past with a lip on the front, I've dropped my phone many times face down and it never cracked.  This lip is a little less deep than the one I had prior, but it seems sufficient, I haven't dropped my phone yet so I don't know for sure. The only minor complaint I have with this case is that the coloring is a little uneven, a little darker pink in some places than others. Because of the sparkly overlay it's insignificant, but it is the first thing that caught my eye. It doesn't bother me, and I'm usually very particular, others may not even notice.

I love this case! It‚Äôs gorgeous and thick. I got purple and it‚Äôs pretty accurate to the photos. Why I gave it 4 stars, the plug-in hole is a little small, if you have a cord with a thick end it won‚Äôt stay in so I recommend using a cord with a thin end so it‚Äôll stay

It's a good case. It's rubbery plastic and doesn't slip out of your hand. It is sparkly but only in certain light. Doesn't look like the picture. It's a weird type of sparkle, more shimmery than glittery. I was looking for glittery. I like it overall though. The red color is pretty.

I'm happy with the phone case, except that the opening for the charger is not quite large enough. Several times I've found my phone unplugged and not charging because I didn't shove the charger in hard enough. I've never had this problem before and I blame the bulkiness/thickness of the case, which otherwise I love. I can overlook it; I just have to be intentional about plugging the phone in.

Really pretty glitter without a gritty surface

I got the ombre green/teal case and it was exactly like the photo. I really liked it. Unfortunately I changed my mind about having the iphone, but it was nice while it lasted. If I ever get another iphone 8 I will totally buy this case again. Love the color and sparkle!It seemed like a standard hard silicone case for a phone, not sure how protective it is, but iphone screens break so easy idk if a case is going to help. I baby mine and never had a problem.

It's a beautiful case and color. Prettier in real life, I got it for my teen daughter and she loved. BUT! On the sides it's very loose and when you but your fingers on it. It feels like it's going to flick off. But it's great besides that. Glitter can't fall off due to coat over it it's really durable. Another thing is that  it has three layers the case, the glitter and the plastic it's frustrating and almost broke it because the plastic looked like it was supposed to be taken off. Hope this helps!

this is a really cute case, perfect for Christmas time!  The only issue I've seen so far is that I have to take my phone out of the case to be able to charge it.  Also, the case is very slick, you should get yourself a pop socket or some kind of holder for added insurance.

this wasn't the worst case i have ordered my daughter but also not the best. It changes its color and looks dirty after awhile but it did the job for a few months for my 10 year old

I placed my order on Nov 19th and received my order on Nov 23rd which I think is in a timely manner. I love how glossy and sparkly the phone case; and how the phone case sparkles even more under the light. It is very easy to hold, use the lock and home buttons, it doesn't block your camera... I don't have anything bad to say really, other than I wanted to put my old popsocket back on this and it kinda doesn't stick well which is inconvenient for me; (I have a popsocket car mount to hold my phone for directions).

I just received the phone case and it looks just as pictured and described.  I haven't used it yet but the only thing i am unsure about is at the bottom of my phone the case doesn't seem to surround the phone just at the very bottom.  I don't think it will be a problem because it seems to wrap around every where else to protect the phone and even when I put it face down on the table it seems to hold everything up so that the screen won't touch the table or floor if you drop it.  Very glittery and a very pretty color.

This is the second one I bought bc it‚Äôs so glittery and pretty. They have to be replaced after about 5-6 months bc the heat from the phone fades the case into a tan/pinkish color. But when new, I get plenty of compliments. Sturdy protection, keeps my phone safe, and fits snug!

I mainly chose this case because I‚Äôm always setting my phone down & seem to spend half my life searching for it. Much easier to find now that it looks like a ‚Äúruby slipper‚Äù lol. Sturdy enough for a basic phone case & doesn‚Äôt slide off of things easily. I‚Äôm Im pretty hard on phone cases & so far so good.

I love this phone case so much! The only problem is it‚Äôs a little hard to fit my charger in it. The space is a little of center so it doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly but it still fits. But other than that, it feels like a quality phone case that‚Äôs nice to hold and the buttons click very easily.

Three months later and I still love everything about this phone case, except there‚Äôs a weird discoloration around the outside. Not sure what caused it and I tried cleaning it and it won‚Äôt come off, I thought maybe it was sunburned from being on the dashboard of my car, but I‚Äôm still not sure.

I liked how it look just like the picture

I like it‚Äôs slim dimensions and bumper guards, as well as it‚Äôs sparkle.  However, it the phone gets wet, the paper part of the case retains water and blobs of color show up.

I like that the color matches my phone, but it's not as glittery as I expected.

Pretty and protects well. I‚Äôve dropped my phone a few times with no damage. It loses a star because there are no grippy areas on the sides.  I would buy it again.

It‚Äôs bendy but is great quality to be honest It looked like the cover photos, this case the best one I ordered in a while and dosent take long to arrive. The case is great!

Daughter loves this case so much.....easy to hold in her hand and isn't slippery

I love this case.  I attached a photo (finger holder not included).  Fast shipping.  I recommend!  It does look more pink to me than purple but the package said purple so I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôll keep it...

Bought it for. My daughter -she likes it.

I really like this case. My only complaint is that my chargers won't go in the port right with the case on. Other than that it is perfect.

I ordered a pink one and a purple one. The purple one is very pretty, but the pink one is more of a peach/salmon color.

Looks great, feels great, but it‚Äôs not as dark of a purple as the picture makes it look. Looks more like a deep pink instead. Still very pretty though.

Look... the item is pretty but the oils off your hand fades the color.  Price is good for the use. We change phones today than before so it should last until then.

The case is super cute but slippery feels like it‚Äôs gonna slip outta my hand.

Great case fits my iPhone 7, the color was not what I ordered but the case itself is a good buy!

This is a bit thinner and more flexible than I was expecting.  It‚Äôs very easy to put on your phone and take off but doesn‚Äôt fall off or slip.  All the buttons fit and the holes were cut out appropriately.

So far so good, I haven‚Äôt had it long. Seems like it will protect my phone if I drop it.

I bought this for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas...very sparkly she will love it.

Love the way this case looks. Solid, true color. It is slightly (and I mean just barely) too big, not falling off at all but easy to remove & put on.

I purchased the sparkly ‚ú®üíú light purple phone case. I read the other reviews before I made my purchase, & it seemed that many people were upset with their purchases. I didn‚Äôt see or read anything about the pastel purple case & that was the color that I wanted, so I decided I‚Äôd try it out. It arrived very quickly & when I opened it it looked great! So pretty!!! Many of the reviews that I read said that the case was 3 different parts. It looks like it‚Äòs probably 3 parts but all 3 pieces came put together when I took it out of the package, & I didn‚Äôt have to take it apart to put the case on, so I was able to very easily slip on the case while keeping all 3 pieces together. I usually buy either Otterbox or Casemate so I‚Äôm used to my cases being 3-4 different pieces. But this sparkly purple case is SOOO much easier to attach to my phone than Casemate is. It just popped right on & I was done! Usually with Casemate cases I break a nail or 2 when I either attach it or remove it from my phone. But not this time! And the purple color is great! It‚Äôs such a pretty purple too. Many reviews claimed that theirs was dingy, not very bright at all & some were even discolored in spots. But not the purple! I was actually very surprised to get such a pretty case after reading the negative reviews. It really SPARKLES! ‚ú® A LOT! The color really POPS! It‚Äôs pastel-looking but it‚Äôs bright at the same time. I keep staring at the pretty sparkles! Lol! The only downside is that when I took off the case to take pictures of it for my review, all 4 sides of the case split underneath the silicone, in 3 places on each corner. I don‚Äôt mind it very much because it‚Äôs really not that noticeable. It‚Äôs very easy to hold, & is very thin, it‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs not even a case on my phone that‚Äôs how thin it is. But I feel like it‚Äôll protect my phone if I drop it from a safe distance. It‚Äôs very rare that I drop my phone but I do do it every now & then & I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt damaged my phone yet! (Cross my fingers!) The silicone layer gives it a bit of a bounce, the 1 time that I dropped my phone 3 feet. For what I spent on the case I thought this was a great deal. I usually spend $40-$80 dollars on my cases. So if you love purple and sparkles then this is the case for you! I added some pictures to show the lovely color and I also added pics of were my case split under the silicone. But when the case is on my phone you can barely see where it split.

It is exactly as pictured.  I like the soft color and the sparkle.  It fits my IPhone 8 perfectly.

Nice, slim case, easy to pop on & use all the buttons with no issues. Not sure it will protect phone if dropped more than a foot.

It fit my iPhone SE 7/8 perfectly and it super glittery and sparkly. So pretty and not slippery to hold!

This fits my SE perfectly, all the buttons and and holes align. It seems pretty sturdy too. I am excited to use it. I got the silver/teal glitter it looks like the picture just a bit more silver than white glitter.

It's got a nice rubber grip so won't slip out of my hands.  Love the sparkles.  Would order again.

I love it! The case is smooth and shiny, not rough like some sparkly products. The only thing I'd change is leave a little bit more room on the charging port hole, it's kind of a tight squeeze compared to my previous case. I can still charge though, I just have to make sure it's fully plugged in. I'm sure I'll get used to it. Anyway, happy with the case.

I needed new case , my was completely torn .

This is one great case for my SE 2020 iPhone! Fits like a glove, has protection on the sides and the red bling is absolutely beautiful!! I am very pleased with the purchase and can definitely recommend it. LOVE MINE!

The case came as advertised. It's nice & sparkly. It's a hard shell with a red flexible cover & a sparkly paper in between the layers. Since it's layered cases, might want to be careful around liquids. It's not bulky & comes up over the edges of the screen for proper protection. All of the cutouts are perfectly fitted & clear. I will update if it fails any drops or breaks, however, as this is a secondary phone & won't be used much, I'm expecting it to hold up for quite some time.

Fits perfect and is so sparkly. Everyone knows my phone.

I love the pink glitter on the phone cover.  It's beautiful.  It slips out of my hand a lot because it's so slick.

One of my favorite cases that i own and most of them are from SHEIN lol but this one is my favorite and i have dropped my phone twice and it is still fine.

This case is exactly what I wanted,  color, Sparkle and easy to clean. Protects my iPhone 7

I bought one of these a couple of years ago and just realized that it‚Äôs filthy, so I purchased both the pink and the green to give myself options. They‚Äôre cheap but they work great.

My daughter loved it & it was perfect for her first prom experience

Red glittery!  it is pretty.

Ordered this for my daughter who requested a pink glitter phone case and it did not disappoint! The case is beautiful and sparkly and has held up pretty well despite all the drops. So far no discoloration or breakage. Definitely recommend it!

This phone case is gorgeous!  I got the red sparkle, and it is eye catching, pretty, and somewhat sturdy.  I wouldnt throw my phone across the room, but it does protect it to a point.  It was also very easy to get on and off.The case came VERY fast.  The price was so good, and it was so beautiful, I may actually go buy more to use for the holidays!

I have dropped my phone several times & my phone has been saved, very pretty red sparkle color‚Ä¶. The only thing is when I charge my phone I have to take the bottom out of the case as it is too thick for the phone charger plug to stay in

looks very stylish and durable

This cover is great but the only thing I found is that when it is on my phone it is hard to plug in charger

Love the color & shimmer

I got this several months ago and waited todo a review so I could see how good it was. Not bad but man it sparkles like Dorothy‚Äôs red ruby slippers from the wizard of Oz. The parts that have rub marks are where I usually hold my phone but that‚Äôs to be expected. The case is easy to come off and on for cleaning. I have dropped my phone several times with a screen protector on and neither got damaged. That would be a 5ft fall. I think this is a great case for people who are gentle with items. Great case overall. I do change my case out if I‚Äôm going hiking our to a theme park though.

Item arrived on time and as described - no other info available as is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. Would recommend for price.

I purchased this because my old cover was broken. Love the color!

I absolutely love this phone case.  It‚Äôs strong and durable.  The sparkly color makes it beautiful and easy to find.

Love the glitter, I get compliments from the girls.  I have dropped my phone numerous times and the case protected it without a scratch.  I use a screen protector which fits with the case.

I love the style of this case. It was exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs easy to install and it‚Äôs easy to hold. I love the material too. Oh, it‚Äôs slim, which is great too! It was a little too sparkly for me at first, but it‚Äôs grown on me. I love the color of blue on the front of this case. It‚Äôs so pretty. Overall, I definitely recommend this style of case and this case if you like the sparkly look. This particular product has held up well with some drops, and I am quite pleased.

Daughter love granddaughter loved it

I have the Apple SE 2020 red iphone.  This matches perfectly.  It's glittery in a classy way and fits well.  Now I have something gorgeous to look at instead of having to face randos on the city bus LOL.

I love the case! I‚Äôve had it for over 6 months and it still looks brand new‚Äî-and I‚Äôm not easy on my phonesü§£.  I read complaints about the finger tab not working and breaking.  I discovered right off that mine didn‚Äôt turn until the cover was on the phone and I‚Äôve had no issue at all.  My granddaughter plays with it all the time and I use it regularly.  I haven‚Äôt lost a single rhinestone, it‚Äôs protected my phone from damage when I‚Äôve dropped it.

I get compliments on this.

Bought to put on my phone for December. Very pretty and nicely made!

My phone case gets lots of attention and positive comments.

Easy to install and like the design

I was in need a of a new phone case. I wanted something that was easy to install and looks great. I found that in this case. The glitter is so pretty. The case is smooth so you don‚Äôt have to worry about the glitter falling off or rubbing off. It was a perfect fit for my phone. I love the purple color.

Bought this for my work phone. Was just looking for something inexpensive, and not a generic color. Delivery was lightening fast.  I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised with how durable this has been. My phone gets dropped all the time, and this has completely protected that from day one. I get lots of compliments on the color of the phone as well. It is bright, but not too bright and easy to find when it is just sitting around or has fallen between the seats in my car. Another big plus for me, is that the corners are slightly rounded and not sharp lines- feels comfortable in my hand.  I 10/10 would recommend this phone case.

Its not the mos protective and i know it doesnt say that in the description so i would get a screen protector, but its super pretty and durable. Overall, 10/10

The media could not be loaded.
                



I've been using this case for several months now. It is sturdy and durable. The bumper edges are flexible, thick plastic and the inside/back is reinforced with a hard shell. That's the silver part.It is super sparkly. I get lots of compliments and I barely go out during the pandemic. It's because it's noticable. In a good way.I've dropped my phone at least half a dozen times and there's no damage to the case or my phone. For the price I am beyond pleased! I knew it would be pretty, but it's been solid and good protection for my phone that I bought new.

High quality. Have bought multiple.

Omg, I was not expecting such a great feeling and looking case! Not only is it beautiful, it feels so good and comfortable when holding. It‚Äôs lighter than my other case and so much more beautiful. I find myself enjoying holding my phone now bc the case has such a nice smooth and cushy feel. I have an iPhone 8 and it fits perfectly.I will be buying more colors!

I bought this for an Iphone SE that I returned for an Iphone 12.  I 'm giving this a 5 star rating because, this was a beautiful case. I loved the color. Due to the me returning the phone I didn't need this case. When I returned, i had no issues at all. My money was refunded quickly. The customer service was excellent.

Sister loved this as a gift! So cute and very protective. Doesn‚Äôt look dirty even after having it for a year

I have insomnia & browsed for very many nights to find a case that I could possibly like for my phone. I have always purchased cases that had the front overlap for protection. I decided I wanted a case that looked up to date & very attractive. I am 73 years old & I still like bling & metallics. This case has the bling in a very tasteful way. It appears to be very well made in which I hope will help with the durability factor. I have an IPhone 7 & it fits perfect. Love the ombr√© (color) appearance. Very high quality in looks. Has a good grip & makes my phone look real expensive.Probably will get another color to have on hand.

This case just cracked this week on the inside and I‚Äôve been using it for 7 months. Not too bad. It protected my screen with no screen protector and kept my phone in good shape.

This case sparkles, and I love it!  The color is a beautiful teal that fades to a shiny silver/white.  It fits my iPhone 7 perfectly, and the quality of the plastic is great. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very attractive, low profile phone case.

I love this case so much that I bought it in four colors (red, pink, blue and purple). Colors and style are beautiful. The three layers seem thick enough to feel sturdy and protective for my phone but still perfect to hold. It looks glossy but it isn‚Äôt slippery. All the buttons work and So does my charger. Fast shipping too.

After years with android models that went on the fritz after about 2 years, I finally decided to get an iPhone - albeit one several generations out of date. One thing I noticed was in Apple's desire to make them look sleek, they made one of the most slippery phones I've ever held. This case does a great job of mitigating that slipperiness. It fits the phone very well and it easy to "install" - in that you're just tucking the phone into the case. It is still pretty sleek, and not bulky at all. If you are prone to dropping your phone in general, I would recommend a bulkier case, but otherwise, this is a nice case at a great price.

A lot of people said not to buy this phone case, but I decided to anyway, and I am vary happy for that! I have been using this case for over a year and it still works very well. It is beautiful and exactly as marketed, and it did my iPhone 7 flawlessly, it is easy to remove, but has never fallen off without me taking it off. Since the lip is clear, it almost doesn‚Äôt look like there is one, but there is. My friend accidentally dropped my phone on cement from like 8 feet up ( we were taking a picture) and not even a scratch. It landed screen down. Great protection, would 100% recommend

Cute but far from perfect. I absolutely love how the case glitters, even with a space grey iPhone. That said, the case does not offer enough of a ridge on the front to accommodate protection for the screen so don‚Äôt plan on placing your phone face down unless you want to rush scratching your display. The opening for the vibrate/silence button on the left of the phone is too small and unless you have freakishly skinny fingers with long nails, moving the switch is very hard. The openings along the bottom are not centered with the charging jack and speaker and also, the window meant to show off the Apple logo on the back is not centered correctly, part of the Apple is covered up. Additionally, there appears to be some sort of liner on the inside meant to make the glitter stand out more. This liner was very poorly thought out and leaves 3 unsightly gaps on all corners. I don‚Äôt know if I simply got a bad batch or if all the cases are the same but I‚Äôm personally disappointed.The case is quite literally coming apart and I just received it.......Cute? YesQuality? Far far from it!

Read carefully, the description doesn‚Äôt match for use with an iPhone 15 max

It did not come as advertised and did not fit my phone

This iphone X case is not a protective ‚Äúbumper‚Äù! This is the worse phone case I‚Äôve had. It is so slick, it makes it impossible to NOT drop my phone! Phone also slides right out of pockets. Thankfully, I‚Äôve not lost my phone! Returning for a full refund.

It did not fit my phone!

I am so disappointed. I had this exact brand/case for 6s and really liked it. I upgraded finally and quickly ordered the size labeled as fitting the XS.  This is obviously made for the X and they just relabled it. So disappointing!  The Lock button is completely cut wrong and will drive you insane. I've had to start taking it off everytime I want to lock my phone, kinda negating point of having a case! The back camera is also slightly off, making it visible in certain shots. DO NOT BUY for an XS!

This case turned brown in less than three months. I am very disappointed.

didn‚Äôt fit

Wrong size and too expensive to return

I hate how it‚Äôs too glittery not my thing more for a child

Super cute case and I was so excited to receive it and put it on my phone. I wasn‚Äôt expecting otterbox protection but I was expecting at least some sort of protection for my phone. I put this case on and I dropped it once (very short distance from the ground) once and the entire back of my phone shattered. Wasn‚Äôt expecting perfection but was hoping for a bit better protection for my phone. Extremely Disappointed.

The color on this warped very quickly. I bought the purple and it‚Äôs turning yellowish only after a few months of use. Plastic is thick and durable but that‚Äôs about all I like of it now.

The glitter portion is gluedon .  Began to discolor and peel after a few weeks.  Ended up getting a name brand type at target.  Would not recommend

Looking great same as picture but Orders for my iPhone XS and got a size for different iPhone

Love the case but it came with scratches all over the outside.  Disappointed!

The color of the case is nice but the quality is poor. Only used this for a few days and the side is already cracking. I‚Äôve used many cases in the past and this is the first time I‚Äôve seenthe case being put together using three different layers, thus water gets stuck easily. Not wash friendly. Will not buy again.

Just what I wanted store glitter case that was super protective! I didn‚Äôt read what phone it fit so I have a 10x max and this is just for the 10x but it‚Äôs very beautiful! And I was bummed I had to send it back.

Purchase the iPhone X case, and it looks very nice, it‚Äôs lightweight. Slim goes in my pocket or purse! I recommend anyone to get it!

Highly recommend! I just ordered a new one because the one I had before finally crumbled to pieces after 4 years. 4 years! That‚Äôs every day usage and dropping my phone multiple times a day. This case lasted me 4 years and for that price and the protection from the bumpers every time I drop it, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a great deal. Only downside is the case will fade over time, especially if you have it in the sun a lot, but that‚Äôs to be expected with anything. Mine started to fade around 2.5-3 years, which is still pretty good for always being in LA heatwaves. Also really love the color options. Hoping when I get a new phone this company has cases to fit that one as well because I will continue to be a returning customer!

Very pretty. Just what I wanted it to be.

These cases are absolutely beautiful! They fit so well and do a great job protecting your phone. I got a hold and a purple one!

Really pretty and sparkles in the light. Makes the phone non-slip and has a lip edge so the screen doesn't touch surfaces. This is my second one. After a year or so the plastic color tints yellow in spots.

Love the design and color. I already have a protective screen on my phone and this case fit perfect even the side holes . Love it

This case is so pretty.  I love looking at it.  My one star deduction is because it actually is in multiple pieces and sometimes bits of dirt manage to get in between the layers and I have to take it apart to clean it out.  Also, the little window that shows the apple from my phone has a big scratch on it.

i bought this because i thought there would be a hole where the apple logo is, and it still is pretty. It hasn‚Äôt yellowed for me yet, but i assume it will later. Regardless my back button still works and serves its purpose, so this is definitely worth it.

I was expecting the glitter to be embedded in the plastic of the case but it is a glittery sheet that goes between the case and the phone. It still looks nice but it isn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I still use it though so it serves its purpose. I still like it.

doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs super quality, but it is a sharp looking case. wish it didn‚Äôt have a cutout for the apple symbol but that‚Äôs just taste. the sides of the case will move easily, i can tell this case will ony be good for a few months of everyday use. negatives aside this case SPARKLES & i mean glittery burst, and when the sun hits it it‚Äôs even more sparkly. the color is gorgeous, it‚Äôs a good case for the price i guess.

The case is very light and easy to put in, the  sides where you can click on you volume and power is very easy to click. Not like other  case .

It‚Äôs a jell case that‚Äôs light weight with a slim fit. The color is very cute (purple) and sparkly. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that my pop socket won‚Äôt stick to the material.

Cute but a little flimsy, not as thick as I was expecting

Doesn‚Äôt pop up at all to protect the actual screen, but looks good

Cute, fun case, easy to pop on. Came scratched in places. Not overly noticeable and won‚Äôt stop me from using but still disappointed seeing how it‚Äôs brand new from the package.

This is my 2nd Case I‚Äôve ordered because I absolutely love this case.

It‚Äôs easy to put on and very light.  I like the high sides which could prevent screen from hitting a surface

Very pretty & well made & good quality

I gave it 4 stars because I thought the case was a lighter purple . The case is still pretty though and I‚Äôll keep it .

I saw some people complain that it‚Äôs a piece of paper in the plastic to create the color. It is, but if your phone stays in the case then why does it matter? The inner pieces haven‚Äôt moved out of place and I‚Äôve had this for about a month. I‚Äôve dropped my phone a few times and kept my phone safe. I like to put sticky wallets on the back of my phone, like cardholder, and they stick great to this plastic. Will buy again

My daughter uses this for her phone. Over time, this product has worn well, and although she used to change her phone cases often, she doesn't change out this one!

Honestly I have worked for two major phone company‚Äôs and was scared to buy a $11 random brand case . This one is absolutely amazing ! It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful! As far as durable I mean it‚Äôs normal. I wouldn‚Äôt go throwing my phone . Always keep a screen protector on with it (glass) . I would but again .

Its super cute, seems to protect my phone very well. And feels good in my hand.

I like this case.  The glitter on the case cracked on all the edges but it is not a big deal to me. Still looks good and protects my phone.

I so far am pleased with this case. I like the color and the sparkle. For being on the cheaper side it seems to hold up pretty well. I've dropped it several times and the case has shown very little wear. Slips easily on and off my phone.

I am very impressed by this phone case. I love it!!! I will be ordering more in different colors.I love the way it sparkles.

I bought this about 2 years ago I think, I'm too lazy to go check. it's soft so it helps when you drop your phone, it looks very nice. and I'm a fan.

Slim case. Great deal for the price! I have dropped my phone several times with this case and no damage!! The sparkle to SO PRETTY. Flexible case that offers snug protection.

LOVE the purple sparkle!! Very well made. I have had the ombr√© one in my phone since I purchased it (I have an iPhone X, 2017) & it‚Äôs protected my phone thru drops aplenty, I just wanted a full purple one, so I bought this version. Great case!

I ordered this purple sparkle case and so far i love it. It is a beautiful color with a lot of sparkle. It is probably not good for someone that constantly drops their phone but the material does give you a little extra grip when holding it.

I love the color and that‚Äôs why it has so many stars. I thought the edges would have more reinforcement. My biggest dislike is that the charger doesn‚Äôt fit in the opening. I would give it the last star if the opening for the charger was better.

Bought this for my 10 year old daughter, it's absolutely gorgeous and holds up so well. Will buy from this company again

This phone case is perfect, glittery, good price, and it feels smooth in you hands. Would definitely recommend.

Really perfect! Shiny and durable. A great purchase.

Great product for the price!! I‚Äôve had the case on my phone for over a month, and have even dropped my phone in the case with no scratches or damage to the case.

This is lightweight and looks just like the pictures. It is very cute! Fits your phone well.

I love the sparkle, it's a little more lilac than purple but so pretty!  It also adds enough protection that I don't feel like dropping my phone will break it.  Can't beat the price!

It fit my phone perfectly. I love the sparkle.

Very cute upon purchase, turns kind of brown/yellow after some time

The case fits perfectly!! I love the color and the few of the case. Very happy with this purchase.

I honestly love it, a few months in and it still looks great and my phone is safe. Great deal.

I still need to buy a screen protector, but I‚Äôm in love with this phone case! üíú

Love this case cute, sturdy, nice texture to it and when the price went down from its original price it became a plus! 8.99 is an okay price compare to 15.99

Beautiful and sturdyJust the protection you need and will get you lots of compliments

exactly what i was looking for, purple sparkles will work with my wireless charger and fit in my car mount.

It‚Äôs exactly like the way it was described-a beautiful lavender sparkle case.

I love it!!! So pretty and sturdy. I ordered another one. Complements everyday!!

I love my phone case holder

Love the color and that is is not bulky! This is the 2nd one of these i have ordered! Great phone case!

Case looks exactly like the item pictured.  Very "sparkley".  So far it has held up well - even with a couple of drops my phone has been protected.

It looks nice and my wife likes it, so what‚Äôs more to want

It‚Äôs lightweight and so far durable.

So cute !!!!!!!!fits my iPhone X so good! I will buy more in the future from this seller . Thanks

Well made and exactly as pictured.

This phone case fits perfect and it‚Äôs super gorgeous üíï

This phone case is perfect, exactly what I wanted.

Fabulous. Bought 5 of them in different colors!

This case is everything I wanted! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments and folks asking me where I got it. Would buy again!

Love it

This is my second case, I loved the first one so much I got another

Very sturdy!

Just got this case today and I love it!! So pretty. Fits my iPhone X like a glove.

The item came in a timely manner and arrived as described.

I‚Äôve only had it a month and it‚Äôs already yellowing, which is really disappointing! It started out really pretty but now it‚Äôs yellowed in the spots my hands normally rest.I assume it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not really solid, blue sparkly as it appears in the pictures but rather a clear case with sparkly paper inside. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I‚Äôd known that as the whole point was to replace my yellowing case.

The entire case fell apart as soon as I open the box. The plastic inside the rubber case cracked as soon as I took it out of the box and the glittery film is already separating from the rubber case completely do not buy this piece of crap

Don‚Äôt fit a 13 max as advertised

The case is too loose for the phone. Will return it.

Had it fit on the phone I am sure it would have been fine.

Doesn‚Äôt even fit phone

I was deciding about this phone case but when I got it I was disappointed it did not fit my phone they gave me a different one

Claims to be compatible with iPhone 13 Pro, which is what I have.  It is not!  Much smaller does not fit my phone. Disappointing!

I like the look and feel of the case. However, it smells horrible. So bad that I can‚Äôt use it and plan returning it. If you‚Äôre nose blind, you‚Äôll like the case.

Maybe it's my computer monitor but it seems the color looked brighter than the item I received.  It's lasted without ripping or cracking in the 3 months I've used it. It fits my phone well

Very cute case! Got lots of compliments but it‚Äôs starting to yellow now so it looks dirty all the time now.

Cheap.

I ordered the purple glitter case. It wasn‚Äôt super expensive, but still, I didn‚Äôt expect a transparent purple case with glitter paper sandwiched by a thin plastic inner case. If you look closely, you can see where they cut the glitter paper to make the corners. There is also a slight plastic/chemical scent but nothing that I found overly bothersome. The case is overall very pretty and really sparkles in the light. It‚Äôll do to protect my phone in a pinch.

The phone case is sparkly, but the purple is not that vibrant lavender colour it is darker. Also there are sparkles on the photo that are bigger to make it look pretty for you to buy, they are all the same size nothing special. It's a gelly texture, easy to put on and off. It's decent price.

A wonderful case, but I was sent the wrong size the first time. I ordered the right size for my phone according to the item description, and the case I received was clearly labelled as being a larger size. I ordered another one, and the same thing happened. Returning both, and going to purchase from another seller.

To soft, comes off to easy

The case is very pretty and sparkly, but shows finger prints and smudges more than any other case I‚Äôve had.  It seems to fit my IPhone 13 Pro well, but makes the power button harder to press.  It‚Äôs worth the money, just know you‚Äôre getting what you pay for.

I can keep better track of my phone now that it‚Äôs sparkling red instead of being black like the rest of my family. It‚Äôs as nice as my previous case and has handled a few drops already and all is well. The fit and finish are nice.

It‚Äôs great!  Love how it looks!

I like this case. Although when I set my phone up when I am on facetime with someone, the speakers are muffled and no one can hear me. So, I have to hold my phone when I talk on facetime. Kind of annoying especially when I'm busy and need to put my phone down, but it's doable for now.

Wish it had a smudge proof finish

I actually really like this case. I bought a more expensive $40 one, but ended up coming back to this one. It‚Äôs light, slim, and protects and fits the phone well. I‚Äôm not super rough on my phones, as in I have never dropped my phone and cracked the screen. So this case suits me and my normal wear and tear.

Just one drawback it tends to lift th screen protector off the phone

I love how these covers fit and protect my phone. I have these in light blue, and light green.  The red sparkles pretty for the Christmas season.  I have a pretty Christmas themed pop-socket I bought for it and I get many compliments on it.  The pop-socket sticks securely on these covers.

I love this case! I drop my phone constantly and it is super protective. The red sparkle color is beautiful!

This case was super cheap which made me happy. And good material and quality. The sparkles look good in the sun as well.

It fits good and works really well!! Would buy again!

Lots of compliments. Nice case.

I am THRILLED with this phone case!  It is super smooth, the phone went in no problem. The edges have a good bumper, but not so big that it makes the phone too chonky to fit in your pocket.  Plus, it's PRETTY!Super pleased with this purchase!

Was pretty and got lotta compliments off of it

This is as pictured and fits my phone.

Love the case ! Simple clean classy. And glittery! So pretty. And not bulky, but seems durable

Just bought my Apple 13 pro and I love to have cute cases but also like not spending a lot of money. This case is cute, love the color of pink and how shiny the glitter makes it. I like that the case feels smooth and is light weight. I do wish it was a MagSafe case though, that is the only disappointing thing about it.

I purchased this phone case for my daughter who's a young adult. She said it's really pretty. I can't confirm or deny this because she's in another state, but she's VERY picky so...

Just as described

great

I got this to have a holiday case. It was great! One of my favorite cases.

What can I tell you‚Äì‚ÄìI've been a sucker for metal flake since the George Barris time of custom rods.  The bling on this case seriously delivers.  And, of course, it offers pretty good protection to the phone (that, too).

Fits well

Love this case. It‚Äôs priced fairly, a great fit for my new iPhone and the sparkles help me find my phone in my purse. MagSafe also works with it. Can‚Äôt go wrong with this case.

This case is adorable and a good value for the money.

This is my second purchase of the same phone case.  I upgraded to the new iPhone and decided to buy the same case!  It's sparkly and perfect.  Great price!!!

Pretty blue. I purchased the pink as well and it too is nice.  Granddaughter loves my phone

Very pretty. Not going to protect your phone much but definitely pretty!

Purple with sparkles is her favorite color. Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. 9 year old loves!

I have had this on my phone for almost 2 years and I have had no problems with it.  It has protected my phone as it should and has looked beautiful too!

this is my favorite phone case ever! when I had my last phone I used the same case and re ordered it as soon as I got my new phone! I love the glitter, I love how slim it is but still sturdy. I got the blue this time to match my blue iPhone and I'm in loveeeeeeeeee

It is worth price and the sparkles are not over powering the color

It‚Äôs beautiful and fits perfectly

Nice

It‚Äôs super cute & great quality

Glitter embedded in Silicon! Pretty and durable!

I bought several different ones to decide which I really wanted and chose this one. It seems to be very durable. It went on easily and I love the sparkle.

My wife loves this case simple easy protect her iPhone and her favourite colour is purple purple or more good jazz happy wife happy life

This phone case is my favourite so far, highly recommend it

Other than the length sides of the case could be a tad stiffer, it is pretty good case for the price.

Pretty good durability!

Pictured as a bright pink in person it looks more rose gold if anything

This case is completely translucent. The picture shows that this is not a translucent case, the apple symbol is covered up. I checked the box it came in 3 times to see if I was just not seeing a piece that goes on the case or something‚Ä¶nope! I have a mount in my car that uses a magnet that I need to put on my case, so a translucent case doesn‚Äôt work for me. Annoying

Completely useless -- does not fit iphone 13 -- the cutout for the camera is too small

Does not fit IPhone 13 , you can place the phone in case and has a 1/8 inch Gap on side and top . Pretty sure the location for buttons are off a bit also . It could be missing a part but came with no directions so I‚Äôm not sure . Returning and making sure not to buy from them again. I paid for early delivery I‚Äôll see if all money is returned for phone and delivery.

It‚Äôs paper in a clear case.  I could of did that my self. With construction paper.  And it turns yellow.

Buttons are too hallow and it makes it hard for me to switch my ringer on/off....

I did send it back due to fingerprints getting on the back of the case!

Although this phone cover is nice looking, it made it extremely difficult to press the iPhone buttons. Didn‚Äôt have this before in other iPhone protector covers.

After 10 days of use the silver lining that is the sparkling part is coming apart. Come is coming through the camera area.

The case is really pretty and VERY sparkly but unfortunately mine came scratched and scuffed. It takes away from how pretty it is. I‚Äôm very disappointed. Make sure you look yours over.

This phone case fits perfect! It looks like it is going to protect my phone, if it ever falls. It is made very well with a hard case underneath.  I love the smoothness of it as it cleans very easily and no fingerprints. I‚Äôm already thinking about a different color. This is just what I wanted. It also carries the color through to the front, which I love. Great product!

I‚Äôm always losing my phone and decided to switch from a black case to something easier to see. I have a much easier phone to find now and it‚Äôs cute

I got this case to use for Christmas - Valentines and it‚Äôs gorgeous. Quality material and the sparkle is absolutely perfect.

Brought this cover for my iPhone as the red color stands out well in my purse. Sparkles in the material pick up light easily and very easy to locate. A good purchase for my needs.

This is a really sparkly case. It fits my iPhone 13 exactly. My only issue is that the pink is more of a rose gold than the pink that was advertised. Which sucks ‚Äòcause I hate rose gold but it‚Äôs still cute. Btw I‚Äôm not really sure how good this phone case is in terms of protecting your phone because I never really drop my phone but it‚Äôs probably not the best because it‚Äôs not really heavy duty.

this case is so pretty i love it , it also protects my screen and camera lens very well. it sparkles so bright and the alignment is perfect for the volume buttons, silencer, and off button. so easy to put on and take off, very durable.

OI have the blue iPhone so this really pops. And it seems to be a good case. Very happy with this purchase.

This case fit perfectly.  I wanted a red case with red also on the sides so I could locate my phone easily - & it really works!  When outside and sun shines on it, it would be a severe understatement to say it ‚Äúblings!!‚Äù  It REALLY blings!Very satisfied with look and quality of this case.

This case is both fun and functional. It really shines in the sunlight! Working out well.

It‚Äôs a great case my mom loves it but as any other case made of this matter a while it will start to have a yellowish tint to it. But if your looking for a good quality case and don‚Äôt mind getting a new one after about a year then this is a good case to get.

This iPhone case is cute with just enough bling.

I get so many compliments on this case, daily. It does it‚Äôs job protecting the phone. The case gets dings ‚Äúeasily‚Äù, but I also have 4 kids so dings happen regardless.

It‚Äôs a very vibrant red color not a bad case just my only issue with it is that the side ends don‚Äôt cling to the phone at all you can easily pull them out. But the upper and lower ends of the case holds the phone in place but overall for a glitter case I will say it was worth the price.

I loved this case the moment I unpackaged it. So shiny and perfectly matches my product Red iPhone 13. It has some downsides though. Not the best at charging magnetically through the back of the case, sometimes when I put it in the charger at night it will say it‚Äôs charging but I will wake up in the morning and the phone will not have charged all night. Also the sides are starting to become loose and pull away from the phone, as if it‚Äôs warping.

I love it fits my phone Great üòç

I loved this case when it was on my phone! I had to take it off for a funeral (I did not want to take a glittery phone to a funeral) and the case broke in half when I was taking it off (which I did carefully). So as long as you leave the case on it is great!

didn‚Äôt really like how hard it is to press the side buttons once the case is on.

Not bad for the price and its super glittery! It's just a paper that's glittery on the inside but you can't tell from the outside.

Easy to hold. Pop socket would make it easier.

Purchased as a gift and must say it is better in person. Clean, rich design and fit perfectly. A couple dollars more than I would like to pay for plastic but one time buy.

Pretty sparkly cell phone cover.  More of a rose gold than pink colour. Smooth.  Softer plastic cover but durable enough.  A bit slippery to pick up, but you get used to it

Looks just as described and sparkly. Well worth the money!

if you like little shiny, gold, girly, but also simple, this is the ONE! she's PRETTY

New glitter phone case.  It‚Äôs beautiful ü§© It makes me want all the colors!

I got red for the Holiday season and I love how shiny and sparkly it is! Seems sturdy. If it holds up well I plan to get some other colors as the seasons change.Update: Tried to come back and give this 5 stars again. This time around I went with purple! It‚Äôs still durable and the red one held up nicely!

Sturdy and beautiful and as described. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Thank you!

Love this case, very sparkly and durable, the sparkles are not on the outside of the case so it just feels like smooth plastic and easy to clean. Looks exactly as pictured and fits well

My wife loved the color and the grip.

This was perfect for my daughter's new phone. She loves purple and glitter so this made her day!

Seems like it is sturdy and will protect my phone.  Time will tell.

I loved it, now I want it it every color. The best sparkly/glitter case I‚Äôve ever seen & you can‚Äôt beat the price.

I bought this pretty red sparkly cell to cover the ugly army green iPhone I recently purchased. Unfortunately a different color phone was not available .  However this pretty case changed all that. It is smooth to the touch and I have dropped my phone several times and absolutely no damage . The price point was good as well.  The only minor thing is when you plug in the charger the case it could be a tad but of a better fit . Nothing bad enough to deter my purchase . I really like this case , both for looks & safety.

I wanted a new, pretty phone case and this is just it. It is gorgeous, the glitter and sparkles look great. I added a "Merry Christmas" pop socket and it just makes me happy. Case seems durable durable enough and I like that it has just the tiniest amount of grip to the case. Not enough that it would necessarily stick to anything, but it is not so slick that it easily drops from your hand or off a surface.

I‚Äôve had this so long i forgot when i bought it! It feels smooth like rubber and i love the way it feels! It hasn‚Äôt lost color or stained or anything! I do my phone so much and the case hasn‚Äôt taken any damage!

Love this festive sparkling case.

I bought my 6 yo daughter an I phone 13 and not only is the case pretty, pink and sparkly, it keeps my daughters phone protected very wel and she loves ot.

No problems with this case.  Love the red sparkle

This is the third case I ordered hoping is was a good one, the last 2 I ordered I sent back to the seller.This iphone 13 case is nice, durable and the sparkle color blue is just what I was looking for.I will be keeping this one!

There's not much else to say. I have a red iphone, I got this red sparkle case for it. It fits perfectly and is probably one of the nicest cases I have ever had. It matches the red iphone pretty perfectly. I'd highly recommend to anyone.

I love this phone case sooo much!!! It‚Äôs gorgeous! I love the glitter and it‚Äôs not see through at all which is a relief because I‚Äôve had a hard time finding a non clear phone case.

Fits perfectly, good quality, and stylish!

This phone case is absolutely fantastic for everyday use! I‚Äôm really impressed with how durable it is on my phone. The sparkles look really nice and the texture of the case is easy to hold and not too thick. Overall very nice and protective phone case. I would definitely recommend!

LOVE this case.  Is it very bright, sparkly, and fits my iphone 13 like a tight glove.  The best phone case I have ever bought.  My phone is red and it matching perfect!

I receive so many compliments about this phone case! Red is my favorite color and so I couldn‚Äôt resist! It looks exactly like what you would expect Dorothy‚Äòs slippers to look like! Sparkly, sparkly red!!

I don‚Äôt have a screen protector on my iPhone, and I got this case of it‚Ä¶ my daughter just threw my phone across the room hitting the wall and falling hard face down on to the tile floor‚Ä¶ not one scratch üíÖ

I was looking for a phone case to match my product red iphone 13 but not to boring and this was the perfect one!! It is beautiful and isn‚Äôt get scratched or cracked. Definitely recommend!!

I love the sparkle on this case, makes it easier to find my phone when I lose it like ten times a day! It is durable and sturdy, so far holding up to all the elements and it's sleek design does indeed make it easy to hold!

Purchased this and another case cuz I wasn‚Äôt sure which I‚Äôd like. This one is hands down so much nicer. Really happy with this purchase

I absolutely adore this sassy case

Exactly as described. Fits my lame iPhone 13 like a glove and makes it cute. Has a glossy finish that is durable and am able to grip without a phone ‚Äúdoor knob‚Äù on the back. My sock popit attaches flawless on it, too.

Love the case, so pretty and fun!

Love the design and colors of this phone case. Sparkly is definitely my go to. If I buy another in future I will get another one from this company. Highly recommend.

I got the red case. It looks like the picture. I haven't had any issues. I have dropped it several times with no problems.

I got a new phone & picked this case and I‚Äôm glad I did! It‚Äôs so sparkly and pretty and protects my phone as it should.

Very pretty and durable works great for apple iPhone 13

Very pretty phone case.

Very durable. i drop my phone A LOTüò≠

Not only is my case beautiful it‚Äôs sturdy easy to hold and it seems to have a nonslip guard. Because I haven‚Äôt dropped at once

I‚Äôm an avid phone user & dropper! I know it seems thin but it works!

Fits perfect! Holds up great!

I love the new glitzy cover for my new iPhone 13. It fits my iPhone perfectly and

This case is exactly what I expected as far as quality and color. The sparkles are gorgeous and the case feels protective enough for my clumsiness.

The description states that the color of the case is red, but the color is actually orange. Highly disappointed as we expected a red case.

Had this case on my phone for less than 2 hours, dropped the phone from less than a foot off the ground (I've dropped from way higher and had it hit the ground way harder in other cases) and the back cracked and shattered. Do not recommend and do not agree that it is shockproof. Very disappointed. Especially with the clear back that allows me to see the cracks all day every day.

very nice case at first! protection is great but this is my 2nd case & they both got extremely yellow/ brown i don‚Äôt know why wish it didn‚Äôt bc this is one of my favorite cases but it gets extremely ugly over time the pink is bearly noticeable

I bought this because I recently got a new phone and I needed a case asap until my other cases arrive.For me, the case is a loose on the sides, which also lets humidity sink into the back of the case so it kind of looks musty after you‚Äôve been outside, it‚Äôs cute but I‚Äôve had better (and cheaper) cases that were from overseas (which I‚Äôm waiting on)

Its not even red its orange but still an ok case

I loved my case at first, but after only a few months, my clear case is yellowing. That is disappointing.

i really liked this case when it first arrived, it looked really pretty with my pink iPhone 13. my only issues were that it began to noticeably yellow after only 1-2 days of use, and it was difficult to put on without getting any air bubbles in the back. if you don‚Äôt mind when cases start to yellow and are patient, these things could be overlooked.

It lasted for about a month protecting my phone and then my screen started to crack when I dropped my phone every time. The sides also got darker. It looked disgusting by the time I took it off about 3 months later and my protective screen was a cracked mess.

Ordered a red phone case an received a orange case instead.

Good quality not flimsy just turned yellow way too quick

I ordered this phone case 2021 and have used it up until 2024! It‚Äôs pretty durable. My only complaint is that it loses the color so easily. I think after about a year it lost its cute pastel pink color. I only kept it cause it‚Äôs thin and durable!

It‚Äôs a super cute and semi sturdy case! However the back gets air/water bubbles quickly and I had to take my phone out several times to get it to go away. Ultimately I decided to get a new case.

Kinda cheap made but for the money works great.

cute case however be careful because the back scratches easily and it‚Äôs annoying

It has a good grip but as people stated there are air bubbles on the back and the case feels as if it would come off very easily.

I misread it and though it was for iPhone 11 but I guess from what I saw it was good and durable

i love this case, i used to have it for my previous phone in another color so i figured might as well buy it again for my new phone. it's sturdy and i love how it looks but one thing i will say its that they get scratched up fast. other than that, it protects the phone pretty well.

Cute & simple phone case. love it

Loved that the color fit well with my pink iphone 13üíï

I got a red iPhone 13 and did not know which case to get. I tried 5 different cases under $20, including another model from Mateprox. I ended up choosing this model. Even though it's described as "Thin Slim", it clearly had the thickest padding around the phone sides and around the camera bump. It also keeps the screen well above the table when the phone is facing down. The cutout for the Silent button was the most convenient to operate. The other buttons are easy to feel and operate without looking. It is well designed and hopefully will protect the phone from small falls.A couple of notes:The pictures were not clear enough. The red material surrounding the case has a pattern. I was hoping this would allow for better grip. Unfortunately, it's covered with smooth clear material, so the grip is similar to other smooth cases.Also, the back is a fingerprint magnet, but that's the same issue for all cases that are clear, and for the phone itself.

The only reason it‚Äôs not a five start is because when I press on the back of the phone it leaves an air bubble that won‚Äôt go away unless you take of the case and put it back on. And that gets annoying.

Pink is different from the actual iPhone pink but other than that it‚Äôs a nice case

I got this phone case over a month ago I believe and I do love it, it has good grip and has protected my phone. Only thing that was a bit annoying is that the sides of the case have turned a strange colour, I‚Äôve tried cleaning it but it won‚Äôt budge, however I still would recommend.

If you want a phone case that‚Äôs going to ride or die for you, your phone and your clumsy hands look no further. This has been the most durable and resilient phone case, I am convinced it could survive the apocalypse.This phone case has solely inspired me to keep fighting.Whilst having this case I did the following to my phone, just to mention a few:- Dropped my phone from a two story building- Dropped my phone from a moving vehicle- Had my phone fly magically out of my hands and sling into the air- Stepped on my phone multiple times- LITERALLY ran over my phone with my car several timesBut my case did not even flinch, granted after being run over it was hurting, but it persevered.I bought this cause it was cute and simple and ended up surprised and inspired by a phone case.

I purchased this same case for a previous model iPhone and I really liked it, so I was very happy to see it was available for my iPhone 13.It‚Äôs pretty in pink so it accentuates my pink phone. Very comfortable to hold, smooth rounded edges and great fit over phone.

I love this phone case it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted. I have had it for quite a while now and it works very well even with all the times I‚Äôve dropped it my phone hasn‚Äôt cracked once. The case does darken a little bit over time but not near as much as other cases I‚Äôve had and overall it still looks very good.

I saw a lot of people talked about air bubbles. I had them maybe the first 2 days but they are down. One thing I noticed was a dent in the back of the case but over all it‚Äôs pretty and I like the pink matches with my phone well. Next I‚Äôll see how long it stays clear.

This case is beautiful! It looks and feels high quality. It fits perfectly and looks great against my pink iPhone 13. The buttons are easy to press and the cutouts are all aligned correctly. The pink detail adds a nice flare and does not look cheap. The back is hard plastic and the back camera cutout is raised along the edges for protection. I love this case and am very happy I purchased it.

I have dropped my phone from all types of distances from the ground/floor. I never have to worry about it damaging. One thing is the color starts to look dirty over time but that's expected. It does what it needs to do for the price.

Not bad for a relatively cheap case. I wanted something simple (clear, with a color detail) and that‚Äôs exactly this. The color (I got purple) trim is inside the bumper rather than outside so it‚Äôs smooth all around. The back is made of hard plastic and the bumper has some grip to it so it‚Äôs not slippery. Haven‚Äôt tested how shockproof it is but it feels pretty protective lol. I‚Äôm hoping it won‚Äôt yellow over time but we‚Äôll see I guess. I‚Äôm pretty pleased with this phone case so far!

The case hasnt gotten cloudy, i love it i still have it.

I love this phone case.  It matches my phone perfectly.  It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted.

This is my favorite phone case so far that I have purchased for my new phone. I love that the sides are pink to match my pink phone. I would love to see more color options for this style.

I have had this case for awhile now and I loved it at first. But over time it does yellow

Very beautiful. Crystal clear back. Rubberized soft sides which makes a greatGrip. Bought pale purple sides and clear back looks striking beautiful on my new pink iPhone 13. I love everything about it

I love this case. It fits my phone perfectly and is a protective case. I love the way it feels as well

I have dropped my phone multiple times. Corner first, face down, side first, and until this day my phone is in perfect condition. 100% recommend!

Not bulky and difficult to fit in small purse.  Also like the color to see easily to find phone

I get compliments and this cute case. I‚Äôve dropped it a few times and no scratches. I do recommend

Looks good; clear with out looking just overly plasticky. The edges catchy light nicely. Has a good grip feel. Have not dropped it yet, but it feels like it will protect well.

This case is easy to hold, durable and looks good on the phone. Highly recommended product.

I am impressed with this case. The bumper is substantial for it being such a thin case. I wish they offered more color options.

very cute case.  durable too.  Happy with this purchase.

Wife loves this cover for her iPhone 13.

I love it simple but cute

I love it. The color pink matches my pink iPhone13. I recommend

Very good!!

Great product

I love the look and its good quality for the price!

Easy to hold

Easy to hold and all the other features

Just as described

Fits snug. Easy to grip while using one hand to hold phone. Not slippery feeling. Cute case for the price‚Ä¶ yet simple at the same time.

Nice, nice, and just so beautiful and smooth and ladylike.  Will enjoy it for a long time.

Great- haven‚Äôt dropped it yet - fingers crossed it works if I do ~ but looks great

I love it. Comfortable and protects my phone when I drop it! Great price too

I have gone through so many cases but this is finally the perfect one!

very good quality

ordered this product almost a year ago and case is still getting the job done great case buy!!

Perfect!!

Love this case! Works great. Love that it has a bit of a front bumper.

Not like other cases where it shows the wear or loses colour. Durable good fit and simple

I was initially disappointed by the case. It was aesthetically nice in appearance but I questioned its durability as it did not feel or look sturdy. Once I got the phone in the case it looked great. I read the accompanying information which states it is scratch resistant.It is certainly one of the nicest cases I've owned and I will be pleased if it proves durable.

I liked that this case allows you to charge your phone on a wireless charger or a corded charger. The last case I bought fir my Samsung z flip 3 the usb-C port the case was too small fir the plug to fit properly and a hook was in the way of a wireless charger.  THIS CASE ALLOWS BOTH and looks good and protects while doing it. Plus the surface is more textured than it looks and allows you to hold on to the phone... great case. Love the Green. I'd buy another color again or even the dark green.

Very blingy with a great fit!

I had an Otter Box cover that I purchased when I first got the phone. It lasted about 6 months before it started to fall apart.  This one is lighter, sturdier,  and just a better cover than the Otter Box.

I've Had A Thick Case For This Phone Since I Got It, I Wanted Something Thin For A Change. I Tell Everyone If You Have A Phone That Literally Gets Thick When Folded, Why Get A Thick Case? That Being Said I Didn't Get This Case For Drop Protection Im Very Carefull With My Phone My Previous Case Closed The Natural Gap This Phone Has, As You Can See This Case Does Not. Idk How It'll Hold Up Drop-wise But I Love The Feel And Look Of It. Fingerprint Reader Is A Bit Hard To Fully Touch (when the phone is closed) But I Allways Double Tap To Wake The Cover Screen Anyways üëç

The cheapest cover ever made. It's also very slick, so phone constantly slips out of your hand. Do not buy!

Very Good Fit! A little slippery... but SolidThis cover fits very well and snugly. Somewhat slippery to hold, but is has a good fee...

Very pretty color but the picture indicated that there was a protective covering over the camera area. This was not the case.

I thought it would have a better grip.  Sending back

It is thin but strong! My phone has fallen a few times and my heart with it but it has stood the test! The case is now a bit scratched up but what can you expect, honestly? My phone though, intact, except for some scratching on the bend. Better that than my screen. I can now enjoy the thin flip of my phone as it's not hiding behind bulk. I love it üòÄ

OK case for the price, top pice is misaligned.

This case is cheaper and flimsier than I thought it'd be. It unattaches from the phone very easily, and feels like it'll crack with very little effort. I'll be replacing g this very soon

I only had this case for a week and I dropped it once and it was immediately scratched up. It dented the sides and took off some of the color of the case. It did protect my phone but I was upset how quickly the case was damaged.

Good looking, but cover tends to slide off. Also, not easy to hold onto, needs some texture on sides.

I bought this because it advertised a nonslip surface. I found it so slippery that I couldn't type with it.

Ease, cheap & smooth in the hand.To smooth for my likings. I sent it back.

I like it, but it came defected.

Fits beautifully and looks great, but it is slippery. Returning. :-(

It‚Äôs cheap af but it looks good

This case fits really well and the color is excellent. The material creaks a little bit when you press on it which makes me think it's not super sturdy. It definitely wouldn't survive much of a drop. It's a stylish case and has a nice grippy feeling.

Wife likes it and wireless charges with the case on.

It's so great I have two of them please made more colors in it thank you üôè

Great price! Absolutely love the color! Fits my Flip 3 perfectly!

Makes my phone looks new!

I do not like when you put in the charger the clase slides up on the phone other than that. Great product!

I luv this case. I am getting another color. Its non-slip, compact, feels good in my hands. Luv It

so much I had to put tape on it to open

Took care of the slippery feel of my phone it went on easy .

Although the blue is a tad different than pictured, it's a very nice blue. Case fits snuggly and, best of all, no name stamped on the outside of the case. Highly recommend.

Had to lightly sand to make less slippery.

it protects the phone.  i have piece of mind now. looks good. have yet to drop it

Excellent Case, Exactly what I was looking for.

I love  the  color  ,durability and smoth nest of the  case.

works great on my phone

Works great

Charges on my wireless charger with it on.

Beautiful looking case. Just wow!

Love this product

The case is a beautiful color and looks quite expensive.

Looks good and slim

It's truly a beautiful and thin case.  Not sure how drop protective it truly is as the case is like a polycarbonate with a slight leather like feel to the back surface.  The shiny sides of the case are a little slick so that's something to be aware of.  I would get the Spigen case for true drop protection but the hinge cover and risk of binding is concerning and it's not this nice looking.

I usually don't go for the lightweight type cases but I'm glad I did.  This one fits perfectly, stays on, the fingerprint reader works fab with this case, it looks sleek with the shiny edges and matte outer case.  Going to get a few more in different colors.

As presented. Perfect in every way. Complimentary to my green Z Flip3, absolutely beautiful with metallic edges. Not sure how really protective it will be for hard drops, but, otherwise, one of the best phone covers I've ever had. A+

Males My Flip 3 look like brand new!  Love the blue color and chromish trim!

Absolutely love the case very sleek look not bulky at all highly recommend!!

Fits great and hard case. Love the color

Fits tight, looks great. I feel it will nicely protect my phone.

Nothing

This case did not fit my s22 plus. The hole for the cameras was a bit too small, which made part of the case sit on top of the bottom camera lense. Since it didn't sit flush I also couldn't use the power or volume buttons with the case. It looks nice, but obviously won't work as it should.

this item has been used only for one week and the color is already peeling off. it has not been thrown or dropped or anything, just from putting the phone in the pockets or the purse and its already peeling off like if we had used it for a year.VERY BAD QUALITY DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY

I tried for over a month to get a phone case, was shipped out twice and both times was the wrong color and size. Wouldn't even fit my phone. Twice. Giving up and buying in purson. Not worth the time.

Didn't meet my expectations. Thin. I require more protection. For possible dropping my phone.

Did not fit. Everything indicated it was for the S21+ but was too small to fit on the phone

I will not put this on my phone. The bumper is too thin and flexible to offer real protection, especially at corners.

I'm not sure why this product gets so highly rated. It doesn't fit well! This case so tight that it keeps squeezing the buttons on the right side. Wrongly clicked all the time!

The case itself is ver nice looking on the phone however it's not very secure. It comes off fairly easy. I don't trust it to protect my phone.

So far I like it, got it today. Color was wrong though. I ordered Green and I got a purple color so I wasn't to happy about that. I don't like purple. üòû so yeah, that's the only complaint that I have.

Bought for my bf and ultimately he did keep it but in some lights it is purple which was super random and unexpected. He has the green galaxy s22 so was hoping it would match and although it does match the purple tones throw me off.

I do like it but the pictures are a little deceiving. I thought the pine green case would be green throughout, including the back, but it's only green on the sides. The back is clear and see through.

Nice low profile on the front.  Edges are slick.  Clear back just shows the dirt that collects inside the case.  Side buttons stick out so far and are so easy to push that if you are listening to something and have the phone in the case you'll constantly have the volume changed.

Overall the design of the case is nice, it fits well on its own and the cutouts are spot on. However, the green color is more like a chameleon purple/green. I don't mind but this was for my husband. The other thing to be aware of is the clear back holds on to fingerprints very easily and I think this disrupts from the point of it being clear. (Being able to see the frosted glass on the back). It allows a tempered glass screen protector to fit nicely on it but I wish it was raised just a little bit more and I think it would provide more protection. Last complaint I had a back camera screen protector on, which I had to take off because the case would not rest on the phone properly if I didn't.

The case is really great, but the charging port isnt big enough for my original samsung super fast charger cable which is a dealbreaker for me. Also I have the glass screen protector, and the edges of the case isnt high enough to protect it.

The rocker switch for the volume can be pushed when holding the phone near the buttons. Not a good button design.

Works and looks great as long as you dont have a 1 pice lense protector on.  It will still work, but the case doesn't fit properly

The back scratched really fast since it's hard plastic, and it's a little slippery on the hand. But It looks really9 good on the phone.

It is the wrong size it just has 22 not plus

Update (after 1 year): unfortunately the Volume button fell out and had to stop using it. That's a shame because I loved this cover. But I can't click the volume buttons so I'll have to discard it. I expected it to last longer because I was rotating this with my other 3 cases and the actual use time may have been just 3 months.The case feels very good to hold. The blue version matches perfectly with my sky blue S22+. Love the little glistening on the bumpers, great to look at.I'll update for durability in a few months!

Loved the look and style of case. Transparent back so you can see your phone color and matching edging so you don't see yellow color after using some time which happens in most of the Transparent cases. Loved everything about this product. I wish keypad button will be more matching with edging color.

Seems like decent quality. I love how clicky the buttons are compared to other cases. The plastic around the edges is a bit slippery for me.

Wanted a phone case that was a transparent backside. Meets those requirements but doesn't feel particularly sturdy

This is a very cute phone case,  simple and minimalistic but the green is a little iridescent so it adds a layer of interest. As my phone has a tendency to launch itself out of my hands onto the floor and other hard surfaces frequently, the durability has been great so far, leaving only the tiniest chip on one of the edges after months of using it.I like that you can see the phone through the case as the back is clear, but it is a shiny plastic that will show all your fingerprints requiring a lot of cleaning them off if that bothers you. In a way it could be looked at as a good reminder to clean your phone often though,  so take it for what it is.Overall,  I think it's a great case üëç

Overall a Good case.. the back provide a decent grip.. but the side is a bit slippery, It's make your phone feel soft and comfy in the hand, but not as grippy as the back and if you have a hybrid screen protector on, the edge of the screen protector will be expose, little to say, I didn't like at all.On the other hand, The option to switch out for different color button on the side is gimmicky, but a Welcome addition. I mean these color on the case aren't that standout, but switching out the side buttons for a neon orange or green give off an entire different look to your device.

It just does its job, it's not that bad.

Great phone case. Matches my S22plus perfectly. Great cushion protection on the corners. Doesn't crack on the first drop. Awesome product

If you bought the S22+ in green and want a case that matches very-very well, then here it is.  Keep in mind that this case offers minimal protection. It's not an Otterbox, but it is not as bulky either. Make sure you are adding a GOOD screen protector. I recommend the ZAGG - InvisibleShield Fusion Defense Flexible Hybrid Screen Protector with Glass-like Feel for Samsung Galaxy S22+. It's spendy but you can't beat the warranty!

Very slim design which I like

For the money its not too bad of a case for my s22 plus. I've gone through an OtterBox and another case and didn't care for them because of the weight they added. This case is very light and durable. Not sure how protective it'll be so I did buy a screen protector as well.

Only dislike was no protection for the screen

The only down side is there isn't much to the edges so the screen still able to be broke. But it's a nice case and fits comfortably in my hands. 8 out of 10

Phone case is snug to the phone and has pockets on all four corners of the phone. The volume and power buttons feel tactile compared to other phone cases with mushy ones. Color is exactly like the pictures and the transparent back let's me see the beautiful back of my phone. The back is really grippy and sides are smooth to the touch. Would buy again.

Great phone case! I like that it has a hard-plastic back and flex-plastic sides, and the buttons are easy to press. I also like that it has a small cutout on the bottom left side for a bracelet attachment, since I use that. Great case!

I love this case for my Samsung Galaxy S22+. The color is awesome, sometimes appearing green and sometimes purple depending on the lighting and angle of view. The clear back shows off the green color of my phone, something past clear cases failed to do as well due to yellowing. Will update later if I notice yellowing.

This case is actually super nice. The buttons almost feel like they are made out of metal and due to that fact they are super clicky and the case itself seems to be made very well. It's nice and slim and the plastic on the back is clear and hasn't yellowed yet. The green color is really cool and matches the green phone almost perfectly.

Very durable case for being so slim.

It's a sturdy case from what I have seen so far. The color is accurate but looks more prismatic in person - kind of like an iridescent paint job on a car. The back will show every fingerprint so be aware. It is not fingerprint friendly lol. Very easy to slide on the phone and stays in place.

This cover fixed the charging device and the cell phone in my car. Made wireless charging possible.

Great looking case that seems sturdy and looks fantastic.

The color around the edge shifts between purple and green which is really pretty and the back is clear. Fits well and is durable so far!

If you are in the market for a protective case for your Samsung S22+ 5G (2022) model and you prefer a slim, transparent design with a pop of color, the MATEPROX Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus Case in Pine Green may be a good option to consider. I really like the color shift color it's like a green to purple shift

The case is very nice, perfect color and fit and makes my phone feel like it's a brand new phone.

I really like the color and appearance of the case. It gives high looks for my mobile phone

This is honestly better than I imagined in person. It had a two tone chameleon affect with a deep tealish green similar to the green of the phone, that shifts to a plum purple. Very pleased with this purchase!

My s22+ fits so well it's like holding the hpoen without the case, and the color (green) is beautiful, and fits brilliantly with the green s22 color.Durability seems good. Button feel amazing, like not having a case!Easily the best feeling case I've ever used, seriously.

Looks very nice and protects the phone pretty well. I made sure to buy screen protector separately. The green color has a tint of purple when reflected in the light. Very pretty and not bulky.

I'm on my 5th case I live this case only rain I order more is because they get dirty.Dropped phone so many times not once has it cracked face plant corners and nothing love it love it so much

Looks great, feels great, I can still see the pretty green of my s22 plus. Love the buttons on the side too as well. Great case fingerprint magnet though but I don't mind that

This is one of the best cases I have for my s22+ it seems to be very durable and good quality. Good on the hand and not too thick around the phone.

Love it it's like a camell√≥n it's beautiful

Nice slim case. The clear case and rubber is good quality. Can't speak for durability because I haven't dropped it yet

Love the color, fits great and love the slim design.

It says green but it turns purple and green but since I love the hulk it works for me

Love the way this case looks on my s22+ the green is very subtle it looks way better than the pictures

Very good.Nice case.Clear back is cool although it scratches and loses its shine over time.

awesome item, it did surpass my expectations, lovin' the button size and design.

Great design. Chameleon like finish on the bezel changing from green to purple. Matches the green on my s22+ perfectly.

this is a very nice case...not a thin case...like it so well i bought two for my phones

Nice durable case. Live the iridescent green color to go along with my green s22 plus. Clear back is still clear with no scratches. Recommend thisbcase.

Funny thing. Thought was a black protector and when put on phone it looked purple. It is an indigo purple sometimes  and blue sometimes.  Nice protector!

Looks amazing, especially on the green phone.  Perfect case!

It's pretty and it protects as I continually drop my phone!

This case fits my phone perfect. It is durable and slim like I wanted. I love the clear back.

Beautiful case that reminds me of the mystichrome SVT Cobra. Fits nicely.

Great protection

Great quality! Fits S22+ phone perfect. It is durable and slim and absolutely beautiful!

Works, not heavy and thin.

I really liked the color of the Case.

Excellent

Just perfect

I have had this case for over a year now and no yellowing. It does have some minor scuff marks, but my other clear case was much worse and yellowed in a shorter amount of time. I love this case. It looks great and the color shift is pretty cool. For as thin as it is, it is very protective. I have dropped my phone many, many times and no damage.  In all the years and different phones and cases. this is my favorite and when I upgrade I will try to get the same brand and color.

I finally upgraded my phone and I love the color green so I wanted a transparent no design green that is sturdy and protect my phone. This is what I pick. I have no issues with it.

Looks good... And, fits my S22+ pretty well. Has already protected the phone for a few drops. Finding that it can be a little tough to hold at times, with the back being so slick.

Fit perfect. Matched the color of my S22+ exactly (green).  Solved the slipperiness of the phone with just enough tactile support.  Added no appreciable bulk to the size of the phone.

Perfect fit.The color is awesome,  and looks great with my green Samsung phone. Ships fast.I love it!

Slim with clear back to show the backside of phone off which I like.

Good product

Received this case today for my iPhone 14 Pro. It‚Äôs already popping off midway down on sides. The case looks pretty. I‚Äôm really sick of Amazon reviews that say 4.5+ then it arrives and it‚Äôs junk. I‚Äôd return but I threw my otter box out assuming this was nice.

I keep my phone as clean as possible, and do wipe it down with alcohol swipes.  I haven't had my silver glitter cover on that long and unfortunately the clear plastic is notably turning brown.

At first, it was very beautiful but after 3 days of using the color turned to yellow. It happens in some low quality products after 2 month, but 3 days? Not acceptable! I am trying to retun this.

Ok. Not as secure on sides. Feels nice and smooth and very pretty

The sparkles are literally a sheet of paper inside a clear case. Is cheap, but also looks cheap

The color is nice but the case is really slippery. And the glitter is just an insert that comes out if you wanted‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ok but I won‚Äôt purchase again.

Cute case but does not cover the raised camera lenses on the iPhone 14 Pro. Now I‚Äôm stuck finding lens protectors because I threw away the package to return it.

This is a beautiful case that I get lots of compliments on. It wasn‚Äôt super expensive and it‚Äôs not made as fancy as an ‚Äúthose other brands‚Äù but it‚Äôs still a really nice case. My phone has dropped several times and the case is not even scratched. The only issue I have is that the volume buttons on the left side of the phone are difficult to push. The power button on the right side is fine.

I love this case. It seems to be very protective and it‚Äôs very sparkly, which is what I wanted. My only complaint is that the side buttons are hard to press effectively. I don‚Äôt always get a response and sometimes have to try again, pressing harder. If it weren‚Äôt for that I would buy this case in several colors.

The fit is ok‚Ä¶ a lil flimsy‚Ä¶ the side buttons are not very easy to get to function. You just have to push a lil harder. Overall, it‚Äôs good and I will keep it but I won‚Äôt buy again!

Super cute phone case! Doesn‚Äôt seem the most protective but so far it‚Äôs done the trick with the few drops I‚Äôve had, but I definitely purchased it for its appearance and I‚Äôm very satisfied with that!

It‚Äôs kind of weird there is a piece of thin paper inside that makes the glitter part.

I wanted the case to be pink not purple

The case itself is beautiful and full of sparkles. The fit is pretty good but I notice it a little loose in some spots but it does stay on the phone.

I'm a man and I love this case! I bought the red version, and loved it so much I bought teal and purple versions for my wife and mom.It's beautiful, with a nice sparkle. It's slim, lightweight, easy to grip, good quality, and does a good job protecting my phone.I use glass screen protectors for the screen and camera, and they fit perfectly with this case. I've never broken my screen or camera lens when dropping my phone, which is probably due to the screen protectors, but I assume the case provides adequate protection as well.I like these cases because they're so vivid and "loud". I like to make a statement, and I often get compliments on it.A pop socket adheres to the back, no problem.The hole over the charging port is large enough to accommodate cables of various sizes. I've never had a problem plugging in a thicker cable.The buttons on the side of the phone can be pressed easily.It's slightly difficult to access the mute/unmute button through the cutout in the case, but it's not too bad. It's probably easier if you have nails.Overall, I love this case and highly recommend it.

I bought this gradient purple case for my iPhone 14 Pro. The first thing I have to say is WOW!!!! This is the prettiest phone case ever! I was so surprised when I received it and opened up the packaging. I was expecting it to possibly look cheap or tacky looking in person, but it‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs gorgeous! If you like feminine, sparkly things but not ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù looking..this case is for you! In addition to its beauty, it seems to be a great protective case as well. The device cut outs and button holes line up perfectly. The front of the phone/screen, as well as the back camera lenses, are protected because it has a nice raised lip around it. So if you drop your phone the raised lip should protect your phone from touching any surface. I feel my phone will be well protected if I ever drop it. It also has a nice, smooth feel. Before ordering I was a bit hesitant because I thought the case was semi transparent and wouldn‚Äôt look good against my black phone, but it‚Äôs not transparent at all. I‚Äôve included a few pictures and a video so hopefully you can get a better feel as to what the case actually looks like ‚Äúin real life‚Äù.  I love it so much that I plan to buy several more glittery colors!!! I highly recommend.

This case did not disappoint. It‚Äôs got smooth texture and vibrant color, and it‚Äôs super sparkly. The buttons are easy to press, however, the vibrate/silent button and charger port holes are a bit off. Nothing horrible, but it‚Äôs noticeable. Also, REALLY wish this case had a camera lip, just something to protect the camera a bit as it seems pretty vulnerable.. overall it‚Äôs a pretty case, I‚Äôd give it a 7/10EDIT:There‚Äôs a clear insert that goes on the phone and into the case that solves literally every complaint I had in the review above. I saw it when I unpackaged the case but didn‚Äôt think it was useful. Yes, it comes with the case, yes it makes this work case perfect, and it‚Äôs freakin sparkly and beautiful. 10/10 buy this case

Love this phone case. I get a lot of compliments on how sparkly it is. I would buy again!

This phone case is exactly as advertised and is also very affordable and pretty.  Nothing fancy but you get a lot of sparkle for very little money.  I‚Äôd definitely recommend this product.  By the way, I purchased the gold glittered case.

I‚Äôve ordered several of these cases over the years.  I love how sparkly they are! They work as they should & protect my phone. I have 4 kids who love to play with my phone & it gets dropped a lot and hasn‚Äôt broken yet!

Very cute, super sparkly. Fits good on my phone.

I have to say the quality of this case is amazing. I already got the red one and then went back to buy this beautiful pink one! I got my mom the same case for Christmas gift and she loves hers just as much as I do!!

Perfect case

I love this super sparkly case! So much fun!

practically perfect for the design

I always used otter box and ESR cases but they didn‚Äôt have any for the release of the iPhone 14 pro so I got this. I haven‚Äôt dropped my phone much, knock on wood, but when I have the phone has been protected!

High quality. Very sparkly. Will charge via MagSafe but it will not stick to the MagSafe charger. So, if your charger is vertical (on a stand), keep that in mind.

The case looks fantastic. The case fits my phone and this is the second one I bought. I liked it so much I bought it again for my Apple 14.

Perfect case.  Soft silicone.  Allows decent grip.  Glitter effect is stunning.  Edges perfectly raised to protect screen edge and camera lenses.

Good quality case. Fits snug and still looks great after six months of abuse.

This was nicer than I expected for the price.

Have bought several .  Love the colors not sure how much protection they offer .

Super soft and gel like. Great value for the money and love the sparkles!

Stylish and reasonably priced. Can‚Äôt complain!

Get the gold camera covers to go with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Super pretty case ands it's very protective.

Brillante glitter beautiful good quality

Super cute, glittery, and protects my phone

Product exactly as stated

Love the red sparkle. I have it paired with a santa pop socket and it looks great!

Fits perfect! Love it!!!

I love the colour of this phone case. Fits well on the opine 14pro

So far, so good.Nice coverage and seems pretty sturdy, so far.Nice price point and quality seems decent.

nice sturdy case, hasn‚Äôt yellowed yet like most clear cases and is very nice and snug to my phone.

I really like this case, it‚Äôs prettier than I expected, also the color sides are not exposed like I thought they would be but inside the clear part which won‚Äôt turn color from touching it. The only issue I have is I keep getting air bubbles in the back of it. But I can live with it.

Title: Sleek Elegance: The Ultimate iPhone CaseThis case impresses with its luxurious aesthetics and outstanding craftsmanship. Its slim profile belies a robust protection that nestles my iPhone like a second skin. This case is a perfect marriage of form and function I can‚Äôt recommend enough.

This is my second time purchasing this phone case. I really love how cute it is and how it protects my phone after dropping it on accident. The only negative thing I would say is that I brought my first one in May and I just purchased another in July, my old case started to turn brown/yellow and the purple outline kinda got bleached from the sun. Other than that I don‚Äôt really mind buying another one from this company, the case doesn‚Äôt leave any water marks or anything like that, just normal wear and tear. I would like to see them address the cases turning brown/yellow so quickly though. Other than that great product! Will be purchasing again in the future:)

I love these cases! I have the pink for my 11 Pro and purple for my 14. I hope more colors are offered in the future ü§ó

Teen daughter needed anew cover.  She likes it and it protects her phone

Very nice, reminds me of a Tech21 cases when I had the iPhone 6s Plus back thenüî•üíØ

I had a similar red case for 2 years that was showing its age. I night this replacement, thinking it would be identical.Nope. Red is actually more of a pinkish orange.That said, it serves me well and no one but me cares about the shade.

I really love this case! The case doesn't mess up my phone screen protector. Clicking the side buttons is easy, and I haven't experienced air bubbles with the case. The only downside to this case, and why I rated it 4 stars, is that the case was bent outwards at the top. Only the case came bent, not the packaging. When it was placed on the phone, there was a gap. I didn't feel like waiting for a replacement, so I used a hair dryer to fix the bent, and the case fits great now. The pink color is the same as shown in the picture.TLDR: Cute case, but I wish it didn't come bent.

Cute and simple

The case it‚Äôs loose you can feel your phone shake when you move it

Seriously. First time was great ! But two times now wrong one wtf

My phone dropped once since i got it with the case and the whole back of my phone smashed, i am confused as to how this would happen as it is advertised as a protective case to withstand drops‚Ä¶ clearly it‚Äôs not

I like it. But I don‚Äôt like how greasy it feels when holding it. I think the oils from my hands rub off on the case. I like how tough it is but I‚Äôm getting a new case from a different site.Update January 6th:I got a new case from a different site and when I took this case off, I could see the case had discolouration.

The phone does not sit inside the case properly so my screen is now scratched up

There was supposed to be clear plastic surrounding the camera but instead it‚Äôs this ugly black. I saw an image of the purple version in the reviews and it‚Äôs clear as pictured so it seems like just the white is the issue. Case itself is decent if you‚Äôre ok with the inaccuracy of the product image.

The sides turn a gross shade of tobacco. It happened slowly over time, but it really lost that vibrant pink luster it had in just a few months. The sides are quite protective, though.

Does not fit my iPhone 14 Pro Max very well. Towards the top of the phone its very awkward and the case does not fit snug in this area

I love these cases! I have the pink for my 11 Pro and purple for my 14. I hope more colors are offered in the future ü§ó

Fits wellValue for your money

Really good quality case. I drop my phone everyday and it is yet to shatter.

I bought this exact case last year for a iPhone 13 Pro Max phone. For the price I figured I would try it until I got a much better case and couldn‚Äôt hurt to try. Needless to say I never did get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù case. I am so glad I took a chance on getting a cheaper priced case. As you can see in photos what the case looks like after over a year of use. This is a lasting phone case. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times it‚Äôs been dropped in a tractor and messed with by a 2 year old. I would recommend this case for anyone. It‚Äôs thin and does not add bulkiness to a phone. When I ordered my new IPhone 14 PRO MAX there was no doubt about what case I would get.

I had a kate spade ‚ô†Ô∏è case, it‚Äôs turning orange lolI needed a new case and wanted one with rounded edges. This is the closest and it‚Äôs very pretty! Glad I got this one. It‚Äôs light weight too. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is a heavy phone, and many times phone cases makes them heavier. Not this one!

It‚Äôs perfect for my new phone. I like that it‚Äôs clear so you can see the color of my phone still, but also that it has the purple around the edges to jazz it up a little bit. I added a PopSocket to the back and we‚Äôre good to go.

love it

I just dropped my phone HARD on the pavement and the case definitely did it‚Äôs job. Case looks new and phone without a scratch.

My girl loves it and it covers well.

I love my case. Very nice love the sturdiness of the case. Love how it chargers on my wireless charger with the case on

Love this case. Durable and cute. Snug fit. Has prevented cracks in many drops.

so so proctective and cute!

Very good quality.

I love the way it feels. It feels so slim and also protective. The color is wonderful if you like pastel pink. Overall I‚Äôm super happy with it and looks great on my phone.

Feels sturdy

Love this case. I‚Äôve been looking for a perfect fit for my new phone and this was it. It‚Äôs a TPU material with bumper which is super protective.Highly recommend

It fits perfectly. Color doesn‚Äôt stand out which for me is really great!

So glad I got this case, it looks great with my new 14 pro max purple phone.

I love this case!!! I will be buying more in a different color

My daughter loves it.

It came in great condition and it was pretty easy to put on. I like the edge bumpers a lot! I wish the area around the camera was lifted though. Cute & simple case, I got clear/white because I LOVE the color of my phone.

I got the all clear one and the sides have turned yellow. Given we are in a pandemic, I wash my hands often so I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúdirt‚Äù is to blame. Disappointed about discoloration but it does protect the phone well.

Very nice case for iPhone. Sturdy and durable. Very effective in preventing damage to the phone.

Good fit

Superb protection and the color matches my iPhone 14 Plus in purple, perfectly!

Excellent!

I loved it

I bought this case recently but it looks amazing on my phone. I have the 14pro max in gold and I bought the Pine Green version and it looks amazing. It doesn‚Äôt feel bulky but you feel protected in it. I recommend it if you want a clear case with a colored border.

I love this case it‚Äôs like the old Tech21 cases.

Looks cute! Have not used it yet but when I hold it is a bit slippery.

As advertised

This case is simple and cute! It fits perfectly for my iPhone 14 Pro Max!

Very durable and sturdy!

Excellent phone case

Fit my iPhone 14 pro max

Covers my phone perfectly and easy to put on

No bad reviews - this is an excellent case!

Still using it 7months later. Its fine

I love this case it is very cute and it seems like it would protect the phone from damage. I dropped my phone 3 times since I got the case and not a single scratch appeared on my phone. It‚Äôs also very affordable I recommend to buy.

This is an excellent phone case! It‚Äôs not as bulky as the others but it offers great protection. My phone fell quite a few times and suffered no damage. Five stars is not enough to enough - a definite recommend!

This case is pretty and simple. Hopes it will not get yellow on the side.

Super

I love this case because it's MagSafe and you can still see the pink phone through the case. it feels sturdy and protective. it doesn't seem to have any marks from wear and tear from the last month or so that I have been using it. no weird yellowing either. I would recommend this case!

Love this case it goes so well with the pink and protects my phone pretty good , doesn‚Äôt feel bulky at all

I really do love this case. Not heavy, fits perfectly, easy to put on.

Transparent, comfy, protected edges, wash it from time to time but in general I just even don‚Äôt feel it on the phone and it‚Äôs great ü§òüéâ

Solid phone case üí™üèº

I just upgraded from an iPhone 13 Pro Max to a pink 15 plus just because it was pink so I was looking for a case that would be protective but still showcase the pretty pink color. This case does that. The edges are slightly raised to protect the screen and same for the camera lens. The case is not bulkyUpdate: the case has already started yellowing so I purchased another clear one from another seller

This case is perfect. It‚Äôs simple, but it‚Äôs pretty! It‚Äôs easy to get on and off and it protects. 10/10

Fits well and does its job

I wanted it to be green toned but it wasn‚Äôt. It has green trim on the edges. The picture and write up make it appear to be green but it‚Äôs clear. I found that disappointing.It‚Äôs nice, it fits my phone and it protects my phone.

Loved it ! Fit perfectly ! The color is so cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è

it‚Äôs really cute and protective but but water gets inside the caseand the sides became de attachedyellowed in the sun

I really love the quality of this case and how it looks with the pink phone brand new. Unfortunately after only a week of use it‚Äôs starting to look dingy so I will be returning :(

Included in package: Mateprox iPhone 15 plus casePros:- Decent build quality- Pink sides of case look good on an iphone 15 plus in pink colour and blends in nicely.Cons:- Case feels slippery- No grip on sides of case its completely smooth- no magsafeConclusion: I feel like there's a lot better options out there for cases at this same price point that have MagSafe and some grip to them. It's a super simple case with a decent durability feel to it but also feels pretty slippery which I don't like I would recommend shopping around for others. 3/5

I purchased this cover for my new (green) iPhone but mistakenly thought it was ‚Äúclear‚Äù all around. Unfortunately, it has a blue tint and it didn‚Äôt work well for me. I ended up ordering a different clear cover but will keep this as backup.

This is very pretty, and seems protective and durable, but its also very slippery on the sides. I wish the sides were textured.

Cute simple clear iPhone case. I like how it is able to hold cards, I personally use it for a bus pass.

Love it! And I‚Äôm a phone case girly!

Couldn‚Äôt believe I could get the case I wanted and delivered lickety split!  Thank you so much.  Got a brand new phone and didn‚Äôt want to use it without a case.  Both came in the same day.  Perfect!

Works really well! I was scared that i would drop it and my phone would crack but it dowsnt! Its very sturdy and has a good lip! I have a screen protecter and the lip still covers it!

looks very nice with the pink version of the phone. seems sturdy and it goes just above the camera and screen for protection. however, it doesn‚Äôt have much grip to it and fingerprints are slightly visible if that matters to you. this was meant as a temporary one but i may keep it now. really good for the price

It‚Äôs Pink!! Need I have to say more ? :) Cute, Plain & Protective. Not too bulky !

It was hard to find a case I liked for the pink iPhone 15. The pictures don‚Äôt do this justice, it matches the pink iPhone 15 plus so perfectly! I like the ribbed texture on the sides, makes it easier for me to hold onto.

Wow this case is so amazing and so worth it. It‚Äôs very sturdy, lightweight, extremely clean. I received a brand new case and instantly loved it. I would definitely recommend and buy more of these cases üòéüíö

It looks so good on my IPhone 15 plus pink ! It fits well and I love the way it feels on my phone. easy to take on and off too.

I bought this for my iPhone 15 plus and it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôve dropped my phones a couple times indoors and it has kept it secured. It matches the pink iPhone 15 perfectly.

just like any other case, it fits perfect

I love the quality of the case. The clear casing, and color border complement and showcase the color of the iPhone beautifully.

the product is as described and quck whipping was the key.

The material is extremely durable. I love how clear it is.Overall good quality

Great quality

DROPPED MY PHONE FROM THE TOP OF A VEHICLE AND IT WAS OK.

Awesome clear case with some added color on the sides all around. Really makes it unique. Has a good grip as well.

I love this case it‚Äôs super pretty on my pink iPhone 15+

This is so pretty for my phone!!! Its so durable, the quality is very good. The phone is protected is just overall a nice phone case. Plus I love the color.

So pretty and protective! This is the case to get :)Not too sure what they mean by fingerprint reading but I‚Äôll just put five starts!

I used this case for several months. It survived multiple drops and still looks brand new. I did upgrade to a magsafe case, but I would buy this again if i were still using a regular case.

I love it. Fits easily, looks super cute on my pink phone!!! Seems pretty secure definitely will be testing out the durability in the future.Sincerely A steady phone dropper.

This phone cover is really amazing and gives the best feel to iPhone 15 plus users with pink shade.

when you first receive this item it might seem like it's not going to fit on your phone but it does the job quite nicely it's thin and protected very good product

The pink is a bit darker than the pink iPhone 15 but it‚Äôs a nice contrast. I‚Äôve had it for a few weeks and it‚Äôs kept my phone nicely protected. I‚Äôm satisfied with my purchase!

Product came in as expected and fit perfectly. So far so good

This product is ineffective. I have had it for less than a month and i tried to return it but it will not allow me. The side buttons have stopped working therefore making this phone case useless and a complete waste of money. Keep looking. You can find a much better phone case trust me.

Had the case for about 3 months, dropped my phone IN GRASS and it completely shattered the back side of it. Save your $14 and invest in a real phone case. It also turned yellow within the first month of use. EXTREMELY disappointed. Now spending $180 to get the phone fixed‚Ä¶. DO NOT BUY.

i love the way this case made my phone feel and how pretty it looked. however, i‚Äôve only had this case for about a week and it‚Äôs already starting to brown, making it look dirty and like i‚Äôve had it for a good minute :(

Fits great and the durability so far has been great in protecting my phone. Love and have received so compliments on the clear and pink color. The functionality has been great with pushing the buttons easily. Would totally recommend and buy again.

Great price

I needed a MagSafe case that still showed my pink phone. It also has the grips on the side of the case which I like. I purchased a MagSafe phone holder stand and it worked out perfectly.

Clear shows my mint green phone and my sticky wallet easily adheres to it.

I recently purchased Iphone 15 and need a simple case that can work well with my mag charger station. This works great and I love the design. Simple and Clean!

With the iPhone 15 series, Apple released colorful choices. This case has provided protection, with a perfectly-machined fit, while also allowing the beauty of the green finish to shine through.

My daughter was looing for a case that could hold the magnetic wireless charger well. It does hold well without a case but most cases the charger falls. This case has the magnetic ring and the charger holds really well. I shook the case a bit and the charger did not come off. Not going to let the phone drop or anything like it, but for normal use it works really good. She also wanted pink to match her phone, so this one was a plus.The case itself look sturdy, again I'm not going to do drop tests, but compared to most cases it looks the same. She loved it.

This looks & fits so good on my iPhone15+ & it matches very good with the color im satisfied with my purchase

I ordered this phone case for a new iPhone 15 in pink. It is easy to put on and looks great! Cute pink wave design on the sides of the case. Front of the case is crystal clear! I get so many compliments on it. Totally recommend.

best case ever

Been using this one for months now and I love this. It matches with my pink iPhone and the MagSafe in the case works great with my MagSafe phone holders and chargers. So far it has not turned yellow which I commonly see with clear acrylic cases. The sides of the phone is rigid for grip which I like.

My daughter loved this phone case

Included in package: MagSafe iPhone 15 case.Pros:- Case feels super durable and tough- Sides of case are grippy and it doesn't feel like it's going to slide out of your hands.- MagSafe works great and actually works well with MagSafe accessories like my bedside MagSafe chargerCons:- None.Conclusion: This case is fantastic for the price. It feels like an expensive brand case at a fraction of the price of some of the ones you can buy in store. The MagSafe works great and actually sticks unlike some of the other cases I've owned that seem to fall off my MagSafe charger this one does not. 5/5 Highly recommend.

Th back glass with this case broke. It‚Äôs many years that I have iPhone and never this happened to me!

Didn‚Äôt like it at all very expensive

Not a good case for my phone

My case came super scratched‚Ä¶

Do not waste your time on this product you will return! I loved it it broke immediately

You can set it down on a mag charger and it will charge but if you try and stick it to a vertical mag charger/mount it just falls off.  I‚Äôm sure it says something about that in the fine print but I struggle to read tricky language so I tend to not bother.  I suppose the lack of a ring on the back should have been a clue so honestly it‚Äôs my own damn fault I bought something that doesn‚Äôt work for me.  I gave it an average rating because it‚Äôs quality is about average.

Simple and cute

This phone case looks great in light pink, and the MagSafe functionality works flawlessly. It‚Äôs held up well against accidental scratches with no cracks or chips. The only downside is the slight yellowing along the white edges, but it‚Äôs not very noticeable. Comfortable to hold and provides solid camera protection.Pros- MagSafe works great- scratch-resistant- good camera protectionCons:- Slight yellowing on edges

This case looks nice, and it isn‚Äôt too thin or too bulky. It allows me to use a lens protector on the camera lenses with no problem and it doesn‚Äôt mess with my screen protector. The pink looks nice and adds a little pop of color. The back is perfectly clear, but it does show smudges and scrapes. The button placement is perfect, and all the buttons work well. I have no problem using my charging cord and it doesn‚Äôt affect the sound quality at all. The MagSafe is strong and holds on to all of my MagSafe accessories with no problems. I give this case a solid 4 stars.

I got this for my now ex-wife and she really likes it. She has the blue iPhone 15 Pro Max and the clear case with the navy and pink looks really nice. It works great with all of her MagSafe chargers and accessories as well.It's definitely not an OtterBox, so it doesn't have the greatest protection from falls, but it is a nice looking case.

I tend to much prefer thinner cases and to be able to still see my phone‚Äôs original design, so this case was a great fit for my needs. I liked the pink accents and of course I had to get one that was magsafe compatible for charging on my wireless charger.It feels like the right amount of protection for so little bulk with great build quality. I wouldn‚Äôt go tossing my phone acting like this case is a brick like some cases out there, but I also very rarely actual deop my phone. Given this, my main purpose with cases over the last decade is scratch and dent protection, which I‚Äôm fully confident this will achieve without a hitch!Great recommendation if you‚Äôre in the market for a transparent case with MagSafe compatibility and a nice touch of personality!

Love this case! I‚Äôve had it for about 4 months now and it stills looks great. The clear has not turned yellow which has happened over time with all of my other clear cases. Also, it has protected my phone very well as I drop it almost everyday on accident. I have a tempered glass protector on my phone screen and over my camera lenses as well. I think this is a great case for the price!

love it !! did take a little while to get here, super sleek & fits my 15 pro max really well! love the color (i got light pink) magsafe is super strong, we‚Äôll see if it yellowslittle update, it is not fingerprint resistant & i have dropped it once on concrete, absolutely no damage to my phone but a few deep scratches on the corners

Got this for my cousin, fits good.Nice color and provides good cushioning on the side.The camera area is lifted up and corners are well protected.Have to see if yellowing happen in the long run.Overall its a good buy.

Great quality

Very pretty and perfect fit.

Easy to hold as the edges are curved nicely. It saved the iPhone a few times now..Recommended!

Helps keep phone protected

Love love love

I didn‚Äôt really want to buy a pop socket so this case is definitely helpful. The kickstand is easily accessible and can put the phone in a vertical and horizontal way.

As seen on amazon! Very durable not poor quality at all!

Love it super cute and protective!

Very nice case. It feels good in my hand. I can tell it will protect my phone but it is not too bulky. The clear back and very nice.

Strong case  , and pretty good quality

Great case and super cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è

It feels amazing it manages to keep your phone slim and protects it from falls! Best deal for the price!

As good as other cases that I have paid 3x as much. Solid, clear plastic, works with mag safe.

In preparation for my iPhone 15 pro max arrival, I was shopping for a clear case so I can enjoy my original phone color while still getting the added protection. The pink accents around the edges and mag safe lining adds such a pop of color against the mundane look of a clear case. It's a decent bumper around the edges and camera lens. Now, does it offer shockproof protection? It looks more aesthetically pleasing with good preventive protection for light drops only as there is no particular inner lining. Also, it's lightweight and plastic. This case is good if you're extra careful. I hope in due time that it's non-yellowing but it's too early to tell at this stage. Overall, it's gorgeous and I hope to be extra careful from accidental drops but you just never know what may happen so if you're looking for something damage proof, this case won't help with that.

This case is a slim way to add a little bit of color and added protection to the new iPhone 15 Pro Max devices.  The case is slim enough to still be used with mag safe compatible items (charger, finger rings, etc.)  Case fits well and feels good in my hand.

It not only offers top-notch protection for my device but also seamlessly integrates with MagSafe technology. The crystal-clear design adds a touch of elegance, allowing the phone's natural beauty to shine through. This case truly strikes the perfect balance between style and functionality.

Had this pink bumper case on my phone for a few weeks and had 3 bad drops with no cracks. The bumper dose not interfere with any of the side buttons. Will keep using this great case for my iphone

this is so cute! its easy to get on and off and it holds up well when dropped all for a cheap price! I would recommend these

The case is crystal clear so you can see the back of your phone and the colors they come in. There is a rubber like bumper around the edge of the case, seems like it will be a great addition protecting the phone.

My cover for iPhone 15 Pro Max is perfect. It offers solid protection without adding excessive volume. The design is elegant and fits perfectly, maintaining the premium look of the phone. An excellent choice!

I‚Äôve had this for quite some time now, it has not ‚Äúyellowed‚Äù like a lot of other clear cases have, glad I purchased

I like the style and it‚Äôs cute and protects phone well

Love it so much. Definitely a case I feel confident with on my phone.

Super cute and protective even cuter then the picture really looks elegant on my white titanium iPhone 15 pro max all the buttons are covered even the new action button which is what I really wanted and pr√©cise when pressing the buttons!!!

Love this pouch it‚Äôs simply pretty and sturdy

Since getting my new iPhone 15 Pro Max I've been on the hunt for a great case that's also pretty looking and durable,  I've gone through so many cases that are just ok - a few good ones but out of all of them I really love this one.  I love that it's clear so you can see the phone color through it but still has some personality with the light pink edging around the case as well in the middle to indicate where the mag safe fits.The case feels very durable - like a hard plastic,  not flimsy at all which I prefer,  the edging of the case does have some textured spots - I would assume this is for better gripping when holding the hone.  As with many of the iPhone cases I find them a but slippery,  this one is completely smooth (other than the edges) so it's a tad bit slippery but not so much that I feel it's going to slip right out of my hands.So far this is my favorite case out of all I've tried,  it's very well made so should be durable,  covers the edges of my phone good enough but it is slim enough where it feels like your almost just holding you're phone,  I would highly recommend this case for sure.

I absolutely love this case for my phone.The sides have small grooves that make it virtually slip proof.The pink color is encased in the transparent body.The back is quite rigid while the sides have some flex to them.The sides covering the buttons aren‚Äôt floppy so if you run your fingers near the sides of the case where the buttons are, the sides of the case will remain properly attached and won‚Äôt bend or flop.Precise cutouts for all the openings.The rear magnetic ring is strong enough when I use it in a magnetic car phone mount. Which turn and big bumps the phone won‚Äôt budge.Almost mirrored back. Very sleek.Clear so it preserves the phone's design. And logo.I would definitely recommend it to others.The price is also quite interesting at 18$ at the time of purchase.

Broke in a few months. Cracking on both sides?? Never had a phone case do this. Dont buy

I got this iphone case recently for my new iphone 15 i ordered the pink one because i got the new pink stained glass iphone when it came it was flimsy and falling apart so i wont recommend buying this use your money on something else.

Perfect phone case!! Just like the picturesIt is not flimsy it is firm!! Go buy!!!! 10/10 fits perfectly on my iPhone 15

I ordered it when I preordered my phone because I hate having my phone without protection. Fits like a glove.

Broke in a few months. Cracking on both sides?? Never had a phone case do this. Dont buy

I don't know what phone thos case is supposed to fit. But the camera and light slots on the back don't line. And doesn't fir snug on the phone. The pops out of the case if you just bump it.

I was looking to buy 2 phone cases for Samsung Galaxy 24+. I chose this brand  because of advertised "magnetic" feature of the cases. But, when I received them,  the magnetic feature was so weak.. it was barely small pieces of metal embedded into the material.. not enough to  the phone on a strong magnet.  It was useless to say the least.

Case feel nice, fits ny phone great, however wireless charging does not work. Phone starts charging, then charging current drops, then stops completely in 10 seconds. Tried it on multiple chargers.Unfortunately I cannot return because packaging was discarded :(

Don't waste you money

Phone case

I was so excited to start using my brand new phone and bought this case cuz I loved the color and design.  Just applied the screen protector on my new Galaxy S24plus (great phone)and now I can't unlock it using fingerprint scanning mode. I made sure sensitivity mode is on and no luck. :(

The case for great but got it mainly because of the mag mounting and charging. Well that's what's the worst about it is the mag barely holds the case itself let alone with a phone in it. It definitely will not hold itself straight just the case I mean and starts to slip down the metal it's to be held to. So I'm simple words buy it for the case colors or style not for the mag mount.

The raised ledge around the lense prevents the case from laying flat against a surface to be able to use the magnetism. Defeats the purpose.

The case didn't fit great. The sides were very loose. The magnet seemed pretty strong. I didn't try it with a mount but the chargers stuck really well.

I was really looking forward to trying this with my new S24 Plus phone. I bought the purple phone, even though I knew I would probably cover it up. However, the color on this case echoed a similar shade of purple and has a nice velvety feel, so I thought it would be perfect. Also, I appreciated that it came with a screen protector and built-in magnet. But then here are the problems.1) The opening for the sound output on top was warped upon arrival, so when I slipped it on, it didn't have a clean, quality look. It lowered my confidence that my new phone was well-protected.2) The magnet is weak. This is designed for a ring magnetic stand, but not for much else, and I wouldn't trust it to hold a credit card pocket for a minute. I added a second magnet to hold it to my car phone holder that clips to my vent, but adding more to the case to make it work wasn't an ideal solution.3) The screen protector lasted a week before cracking. I've had screen protectors that lasted years, not days! It could have been the angle, but when a piece of silverware slipped from a few inches above it and tapped it, it was all over for that protector.In the end, I bought a different case bundled with a screen protector and added a matching magnetic ring stand. They are much better quality and look nice. I would give this a hard pass and find something better quality to protect your investment.

Fit my Galaxy S24+. Works fine. Does come off easily. Not as sturdy. Does not come with a lens protector for back camera.

Case is ok ,but a finger print magnet.

This case is perfect for anyone, who just want a nice looking case, noting too bulky in the hand I got two one for me and one for my wife and she loves it, fit to size I would recommend üëå

I like this case it is light and make fits right on my phone.  I have not experienced any gaps on my p phone to determine how good it is.  But just love the quality and scratch resistance as well as easy to install. It is worth the price.

The case's color is a striking aubergine. It fits the Samsung phone well and it isecures the phone when it is inserted. The accompanying screen protector is glass‚Äêlike so it can provide good scratch resistance.

I got my Samsung S24+ last week and immediately searched for a protective case and screen protector.  Glad I found this one, as it has a really great texture on the edges and should not escape from my hands.There is no "guide" to put on the screen protector, but it was very easy to install with the front camera centered.  However, I had to remove the screen protector because it would NOT recognize my fingerprint.  I tried to add a new fingerprint with the protector in place, but it could not add the "new" fingerprint either...so I had to remove it.  Maybe it is too thick?  Maybe it has something in it that won't let it be read? I don't know the cause, but it simply would not let me open my phone and apps until I removed it.There is a chrome ring around the rear cameras to protect the lenses, and there are nice chrome button covers on the side.4 stars because this case is great, but I still have to find a screen protector that works.

Super amazing and sensitive screen protector! I tried three different brands before, and the fingerprint sensor didn‚Äôt work with them. But this brand is very sensitive, cool, and amazing. Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy it‚Äîlogically priced, fits the case well, and comes with three super-sensitive screens. Thanks to the seller!

Looks great, feels great, super happy! Product charges tirelessly with case on and also works great with my magnet car phone holder!

Lovely finish! Very good case and screen gaurd üëçüèº

Its a nice case and its much cheaper then the options at the verizon store .

Love the weight.  Thin profile.

Excellent

Perfect color and cover! I love it!

I like this case

It's protective and feels nice, like holding it is actually comfortable.  Protects the phone well and the magnet is great, magnetic pop socket works perfectly!

The MATEPROX cover for the Samsung Galaxy S24+ is a good quality cover. Ordered in the crystal version.The built quality and the material used is of excellent quality. The fitting and the design is flawless.Fits perfectly. The Screen protector is also very good- rolls out smoothly and takes shape without any air bubbles. For durability we will have to wait. But to be honest all the phone covers and the screen protectors have pretty much the same product life of 2-3 years and after that you need a new one- But lets see how this one from MATEPROX comes along with time. I would give it an all star rating and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality cover along with a superior screen protector for their new Samsung Galaxy S24+ Good luck

Good phone case wld recommend

This case is literally gorgeous oh my gosh I want to throw all the other cases I bought in the garbage! (I bought 12 other cases) The metallic design around the camera is soooooo esthetically pleasing to the eyes! Now I just have to get a camera lens protector to finish the case off. The screen protector does make it a little hard to read the fingerprint but I've noticed that I have to hold my thumb on it for a second longer which isn't bad at all it's definitely worth it for this case! Anyway BUY IT AND BUY IT NOW!

It fits perfectly on my phone, I only had it on for a day but it looks and feels nice.

This is my favorite case I've found for my s24 plus, it's soft and premium feeling and I now I don't wanna use my other cases or buy anything else again. I bought all the colors because I love it so much.

It's a nice case with silk touch. The magsafe ring works perfectly when I use my magsafe wallet. It's been almost 2 months since I bought it and it seems resistant to the use. Perfect fit in my S24+

Liked the see throug case to useca chrgervorvstickerscfrom underneath.

I am Very happy with the purchase.  It is very good quality for the price paid .

It fit perfect  my galaxy and protect it fall twice since I got it and no problems

Really love the case and color. A few weeks after using the case discolored. I thought maybe it was dirty. So I washed it but the color didn't change.

this case is awesome! really good quality and has a really clean design! i love that the back is still semi transparent to see through to my dbrand skin! nice touch with the metal frame for the camera cutout and the buttons are really easy to press. great case for the price!

I have been using this case for a while now and it is gorgeous. The back is clear, the sides are not transparent and the buttons/camera slots are shiny.

My Husband is loving this case! Let's just say he's a butterfingers lol

Worth every dollar spent, cheap, looks like the pics (if not better, lol), and feels good in the hands. 10/10

Fits perfectly and light weight

It's nice

Alright, tech aficionados and style mavens, gather round while I spill the deets on MATEPROX's Magnetic Case for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus. I've been rocking this bad boy on my brand-new S24+, and let me tell ya, it's a game-changer.This case had me at "magnetic design." Snapping it onto my phone was like finding the missing piece of a puzzle ‚Äì satisfying and secure. The magnets are strong enough to keep the case firmly in place, yet not so strong that it's a struggle to remove. The ease of popping it off and on? A blessing for someone who switches cases often.Now, let's chat aesthetics. The translucent matte finish in purple gives my S24+ a sophisticated touch while showcasing its sleek design. And, friends, it's not one of those cases that yellows faster than a banana in the sunshine. It's kept its cool, nebulous purple hue without a hint of discoloration.The protective aspect hasn't gone unnoticed either. The screen protector ‚Äî included, by the way (score!) ‚Äî aligns with military precision. And the case itself hugs every curve of my S24+, offering a buffer against life's little mishaps without adding bulk. It's like my phone's personal bodyguard, but, you know, with style.Time for the nitty-gritty. One minor quirk: the case is smooth to the point of being a bit slippery. A little extra grip on the sides wouldn't hurt, especially for us butterfingers out there. And while the screen protector is a nice bonus, an extra notch in clarity and responsiveness would take it from good to gold.Here's a pro tip: once you've got the case on, give your wireless charger a whirl to ensure compatibility. You don't want any surprises there.In a nutshell, the MATEPROX Magnetic Case for the Galaxy S24 Plus is a solid choice for anyone looking to blend style, protection, and that cool, magnetic magic. It's not just a case; it's the partner your shiny new Galaxy didn't know it needed. Just, you know, watch out for slippery situations.

The Magnetic Design for Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus Case has exceeded my expectations in both style and functionality. The sleek and slim design adds a touch of elegance to my phone while providing excellent protection against drops and scratches.The magnetic closure system ensures a secure fit, keeping the case firmly in place while allowing for easy installation and removal. I appreciate the added convenience of the included screen protector, which offers an extra layer of defense against scratches and smudges.The translucent matte finish adds a subtle touch of sophistication to the case, while the purple color option adds a pop of personality. The anti-yellowing properties ensure that the case maintains its vibrant color over time, resisting discoloration from prolonged use.Overall, I couldn't be happier with this Magnetic Case for my Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus. It strikes the perfect balance between style and protection, making it a must-have accessory for any smartphone user.

Fits my new Samsung Galaxy S24+ perfectly.  Like that the back is clear to see the phones color. It's a very minimal case but has good border edges that will keep a flat surface from hitting the camera lenses and front of phone.  The included screen protector went on flawlessly. First try did have a pesky dust particle but quickly lifted and got rid of it and now no bubbles at all.  I did need to redo my fingerprint settings though.  It didn't recognize the one I set just before placing it on.  Easily done and it's read fingerprint fine ever since redoing them.Absolutely love the color chromatic green color of the case edges going around the phone edges.  Hints of various green blue purples.The volume and power buttons are practically not there yet work perfectly so far.There is obvious fingerprint swipes that develop on the back but wipe off easy enough but having it clear is nicer and adds to how minimal size it adds.  It really doesn't feel much bigger than the phone without it.There's also an ever miniscule half mm maybe gap between the screen protector and case edge.  Might gather little tiny things over time but..... it fits nice.Very pleased.

I'm finally happy because this is my second MagSafe case for my Galaxy S24+. The first one looked nice but had a weak magnetic connection, causing issues with my accessories. This MATEPROX case is fantastic! It's got a great design, feels high-quality, and the magnets are super strong.  All my MagSafe accessories now work perfectly. Highly recommend!

This phone case can easily fit my phone and it gives me everything I need as  a phone case. It nicely cover and protect my camera lense. It also comes with magnetic ring at the back. Good one!

I am pleased with this case. It's nice & streamlined but still feels like it offers reasonable protection. The case comes with a tempered glass screen protector, but I already have one on my phone so I didn't use it; but I appreciate that it was included.The feel of this case is really nice and not slippery, almost like a suede feel. Fit is good and all the cutouts line up properly with the ports. Buttons also work easily with no issues. And the magnetic function of this case is very strong. I had a couple Magsafe compatible accesories that didn't work well with another magneticized case & they work great with this.

Just as described. comes with the glass protector which i did not use as i had one already. It fits firmly around the phone a protects it. It has a nice grip to it not slippery

This phone case is the one I bought for my aunt, and its back panel is different from most frosted back panels I've seen. It features a crystal-clear back panel made of an anti-yellow transparent material, which nicely showcases the color details of the phone. My aunt really loves this design. The rounded corner frame of this phone case is also worth mentioning. I believe the rounded edges provide a better grip, so even holding it for a long time won't feel uncomfortable. Besides its appealing appearance, the TPE frame of this phone case also offers good shockproof functionality. My aunt mentioned that even if her phone falls from the table, there are no issues because the TPE frame of this phone case is thick enough and effectively absorbs impact.

I recently got the new S24 Plus.  I ordered several cases to try to see which one I liked best.  I like the color purple & wanted one with a magnet, so I can use a ring stand or wallet with it.  I also like that it doesn't cover the camera lenses as I have already applied lens covers to them.  It fits perfectly on my phone & the ring stand I have attaches perfectly.  I also have a wallet that works.  It does work on my wireless charger, as well.  Overall, this is a very nice case & I think one of my favorites.

I recently purchased the Magnetic Design for Samsung S24 Plus Case for my son, who recently got this phone. I must say, this case has exceeded my expectations in terms of both style and protection.  It fits the Samsung S24 Plus perfectly, hugging the phone's contours without adding unnecessary bulk. The translucent matte finish adds a touch of elegance, giving the phone a modern and stylish look.  This case has shockproof protection. My son accidentally dropped his phone on the floor, and to our relief, there was no damage whatsoever.  The magnetic design of the case is another feature that I appreciate. It securely holds the phone in place, ensuring that it doesn't slip out accidentally. The magnetic closure is strong and reliable, providing peace of mind knowing that the phone is well-protected.  The case is lightweight, which is a bonus for my son who prefers a slim and lightweight phone case. It doesn't add any unnecessary bulk, allowing for easy handling and comfortable use of the phone.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Magnetic Design for Samsung S24 Plus Case. It combines style, protection, and convenience flawlessly. The excellent quality of the case has been proven when my son accidentally dropped his phone, and it remained unharmed.

I ordered this for my partner since he just got an S24+ and hadn't gotten a case yet.  He's not as dropsy as I am, so he really doesn't need anything bulky.  I was a little worried when I took it out of the box because the bumper case is -very- lightweight, but it seems like it's actually gonna be perfect for him!  It's very sleek, a good fit, and screen film is fantastic.  He won't use the lanyard, but I might since I'm a little more careless.  Hahaha

This is a very nice case for S24+. The case is super slim and lightweight. And this case is really protective.  It has a shockproof bumper. It also comes with a screen protector, which is a huge bonus. All the buttons, ports, and camera lenses are easily accessible, and the case doesn‚Äôt interfere with the phone's functionality at all.

Case fit pretty good. The clear back is actually easier to grip than I thought. The screen protector fit good and was amusing to set on. No bubbles.

This is a stylish and slim phone case, feels good in hand. It comes with a phone tempered film to protect the phone. It‚Äôs easy to install and it looks sturdy and secure to protect against drops. The good quality phone case can offer extra protection against collisions from iPhone lenses and screen scratches. It's also anti-fingerprint on the back, so it's not easy to get dirty.

This case is very durable and strong. It looks great too, and is very pleasing to look at. Now, for the screen protector, it is just what I wanted. These are perfect and great quality for the price. Barely noticeable on my phone! I Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice, good-quality screen protector.

The matte finish on the back of this phone case provides a delightful tactile experience, and its embedded magnetic ring adds a touch of innovation. The magnetic ring, seamlessly integrated into the back, ensures strong and secure attachment, enhancing the overall convenience of the case. The metallic buttons contribute to the premium feel of the case, providing a durable usage. I like notable feature is the silicone material around the camera area, which raises and protects the phone lens effectively. This thoughtful design prevents scratches and potential damage to the camera, ensuring its longevity. The inclusion of a screen protector in the set adds extra value, offering comprehensive protection for both the front and back of the phone. OverallÔºåthis phone case additional screen protector enhances its overall value, making it a comprehensive and stylish choice.

Ordered this phone case for my pre-ordered Samsung S24. It's in this sleek matte black color that honestly looks super chic. I'm all about feeling the texture of things,  the texture is smooth and comforting. The magnetic hold is strong, giving a sense of security. The elegant color will turn the phone into a stylish accessory that even catches people's attention on the street.

I just got it today and immediately checked its security. This s24 ultra case has a great protection. But it's not bulky, it's still slim feeling,the phone case material feels great to the touch, it's a nice material. full marks for this design. I got the crystal transparent and it's too good to be true! I am very happy with it!

The clear, thin, and slim design of the case beautifully showcases the sleek aesthetics of the Samsung Galaxy S24+. The crystal-clear transparency allows the phone's design to shine through while providing a layer of defense against everyday wear and tear. The shockproof bumper is a standout feature, offering robust protection against accidental drops and impacts. The reinforced corners and edges provide an added layer of security, safeguarding the vulnerable areas of the phone. Despite its protective features, the case manages to maintain a lightweight and pocket-friendly feel, making it a practical choice for daily use.

The moment I saw this Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus case, it was like a little burst of spring right in my living room! The matte, semi-transparent look with that adorable metallic pink mixed with cherry blossom pink ‚Äì it's just my style. The magnetic design for charging is super convenient, and the matte semi-transparent design in metallic and cherry blossom pink is just beautiful. It's lightweight and comfortable to hold. The included screen protector was a bit tricky to apply, but it's a minor issue. Overall, a lovely addition to my phone, although I wish the edges were a bit more protective.

The black bumper accentuates the case's sleek design, offering a sophisticated contrast to the transparent back. This feature not only enhances the visual appeal of the case but also provides a secure grip, reducing the likelihood of accidental drops.

I have the purple galaxy s24 and got the hunter green case and it compliments it so well! The back is clear. The beautiful purple phi with thr dark green edges is absolutely gorgeous. The green sides also appear to be iridescent with purple shades in different lighting and it matches the phone perfectly!It feels like a good protective case as well. Not cheap or flimsy feeling. May get another color as well but not right away as I'm absolutely in love with this one.

This is a nice case.  Lite but keeps it protected.  I always had bulky cases because I drop my phone all the time, so I need to know it's protected.  This case protects it but is still super cute and sleek.

Just like it shows

Good fit and do like it but the magnet is not very strong and doesn't hold on my car magnet.

Worth every dollar spent, cheap, looks like the pics (if not better, lol), and feels good in the hands. 10/10

Got what I paid for

Love the color and it's comfortable to hold. I would of preferred for it to be a little bit more thicker but other then that it's great.

I so badly want to review this positively, but after having this case for over a month, the visible mould line has become immensely irritating as its where I hold the phone. I would accept that if it was cheaper, but for this price it should be a full finish! This seems like a small complaint but the discomfort has led me to stop using the case, im not sure if this was a defective unit or all cases are done in this way. Another smaller complaint is that the back is a fingerprint magnet due to the material used but I can look beyond that

Should have listened to other reviews about the weak magnet. It keeps falling off in my car when I need my phone for directions.

This Galaxy S24 case is exactly as described.The case fits perfectly, is a matte finish so not slippery, with color trim (I got the black) and a clear back.  It is very slim so easy to hold.It will undoubtedly protect against short drops onto carpet, wood, laminate or soft tile floors. However, it does not appear to be robust enough to be dropped in a parking lot onto cement without damage to the phone.  I do not plan to test that feature.I dropped the rating down a star because it does not come with instructions for installing the screen saver.  This is only my second "smart" phone so I clearly need instructions to make my screen saver stick.

This case is great looking on my grey s24. The purple seems brighter once on the phone. Great protection, nice soft matte feel, and magsafe compatible! I can easily pop on my magnetic pop sockets. Highly recommend.

This case fits like a glove and looks fantastic. Both the case and the screen cover are very protective yet not overbearing. The phone still has a slim, clean look. Both the case and the screen protector are very easy to install. I am very happy with this case and its quality. I think it will last a long time.

This case fit my new Galaxy S24 perfectly.  It's not slippery, was easy to put on, and seems like it will be nice and sturdy.  I added a screen protector and a camera lens protector for extra protectionI tend to keep my phone until it dies.  This phone replaced the S10-e.  A good case is essential to long phone life. This one is just the ticket.

Ordered this for my son's new phone.He loves it.Says it fits perfectly.Added screen protector.Well-made.Nice color.Recommended.

I really liked this protector because it easily adapts to my phone, the case is resistant to falls and has its screen protector to be able to take care of your valuable phone. It is perfect for the galaxy 24 ultra so if you use this particular phone it is a very good purchase, I highly recommend it, it installs easily

Mateprox magnetic case for Samsung S24. Made in China. Got my new S24 in Violet and like it so much I was in no hurry to cover it up. This purple is a perfect case and match in translucent color.

Quality, durable case. Just the outer edges are colored with an iridescent color, back is clear. Camera cutout fits perfectly. I love that it came with a screen protector, as some do not. Raised about the glass to help protect the screen as well.

I ordered this case and screen protector for my husband to use on his Samsung Galaxy S24. It's a perfect fit and he's happy with it. However, it had been a very long time since he had installed a screen protector and any sort of directions would have been appreciated. There were none included and there are none of the selling page of the item. The case seems sturdy and is well priced for what's included (currently $16.99).

I got this for my Samsung S24. I like how the back of the case is translucent so you can see the original color of the phone. It has better grip than some of my other phone cases. The raised edges around the camera keep the lenses from coming in contact with other surfaces. The power and volume buttons have a good feel and aren't mushy.I've been using this case to stick to my magsafe phone charger in my car. The magnets are strong and doesn't affect charging speeds.

I love my MATEPROX Magnetic Design for Samsung Galaxy S24 Case! The cutouts for the charging ports and buttons are so precise. This case has built-in magnets, which means it automatically aligns with my magnetic charger. No more fumbling around trying to get the charger to connect properly. Plus, it supports wireless charging, so I can just plop my phone down on the charging pad and it starts charging like. Now, let's talk about the design. The translucent back of the case is super cool because it prevents it from turning yellow over time. And it's so soft to touch, like a baby's bottom (okay, maybe not that soft, but you get the idea). The metallic camera frames and buttons add a touch of style to my phone, making it look even more awesome than it already is. With a raised bevel on the camera lens and screen, it keeps them safe from scratches and bumps. Plus, they even include a tempered film to protect the screen even more.

It provides a successful fusion of robustness and style. In addition to looking amazing, the anti-yellow translucent matte coating maintains the case's youthful appearance. My son's Galaxy S24 is securely attached thanks to the magnetic design, and the shockproof elements offer good protection without sacrificing the device's thin contour. The case feels good in the hand and the black hue gives it a contemporary look. It is a great option if you look for a case that strikes a balance between style and utility.

This is a perfect fit for the new S24.  I didn't use the included screen protector (I bought another set) but it's nice to have backup.  I didn't notice this come with a wrist strap and will likely never use that either, but you don't have to put it on.  The case is very clear and showcases the phone well.  I like it!

This is a great phone case. It is light and thin but super durable! The precise hole reserved makes it fit the phone perfectly. The magnetic design supports all the magnetic accessories such as power bank, magnetic wallet and magnetic car mount and so on. And the material that it made of is soft, anti-fingerprint and scratch resistant. Very valuable phone case, it protects my phone from dropping and scratching. It provides the fully protection for my phone. I really like it.

This Case is a fantastic addition to my phone accessories. Its transparent back maintains the unique color of my cellphone, allowing its beauty to shine through while providing reliable protection. The case fits snugly around the phone, offering a secure grip and easy access to all buttons and ports. I appreciate how it adds minimal bulk to the phone, maintaining its sleek profile.

It's good quality, price & package delivery. It also comes with screen protector.

Just received my Samsung phone and immediately noticed how slippery and challenging it is to hold due to its glass back and metal edges. To address this issue, I opted for a case that offered three key features: built-in MagSafe compatibility, protection against drops and scratches, and enhanced grip. I'm pleased to report that this case excels in all three areas.The MagSafe functionality performs admirably, securely holding my phone in place on my car mount without impeding wireless charging capabilities. The case itself fits snugly, with precise cutouts and buttons. Its crystal-clear color adds a sleek aesthetic, although its potential for yellowing remains to be seen.However, the best feature for me is the softer TPU material used for the edges. Not only does it serve as a reliable bumper for impact absorption, but it also significantly improves grip‚Äîmaking typing and carrying the phone much easier.With this case, my grip and protection concerns are effectively addressed. A solid 5/5 rating from me.

Here's a quick review of the Mateprox Magnetic Phone Case.What I like:- Soft touch matte finish- Translucent back- Purple accent pairs surprisingly nice against the Amber Yellow S24.- Excellent camera protection due to VERY deep bezels- Strong magnet ring that works flawlessly with Magsafe charger.- Easy to click buttons- Perfectly lined port openings- Decent front screen protection thanks to raised lip- Kit comes with tempered glass screen protector which I did not expectWhat I don't like:- Magnetic ring is glued to the inside of the case.  Others were able to embed the ring inside the TPU.  As such, inside is not 100% smooth.Overall, it's still an excellent phone case that is both aesthetically pleasing and protective at the same time.

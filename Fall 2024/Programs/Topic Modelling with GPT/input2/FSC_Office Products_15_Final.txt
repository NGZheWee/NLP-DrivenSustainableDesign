I wont buy this again. When I printed the labels on the white label paper, the template is only in a word doc or pdf, and it will not erase the heavy black border on the labels.  Should have been clear or allowed me to design over the black border - which I did so from photoshop, then placed my design on the digital template. However, when printing the template onto the supplied labels they were off the alignment. Very disappointing for an event that we used them for.

Everything about this paper is great EXCEPT it is is very yellow... not bright white. I just finally opened it to use it, and noticed the yellow cast. I have unfortunately missed the return window so I am stuck with it, but wondering if I was sent the correct item because the listing says bright white. Makes no sense

It is listed as a 65 LB. weight, yet it is the weight of printer copy paper. It is thin and gives no support or depth when I cut it to shapes.

The package came in ripped and some of the papers were folded. I’m not sure if the full amount of paper was in the package because on how badly ripped it was.

The shipping box looked fine but paper was damaged as shown in the picture I provided.  Damage couldn't be seen until I removed manufactures plastic wrapping.  I can only assume damage was present prior to being wrapped.  There was no evidence of damage on manufacturing wrap or on the shipping box.  Although, there was no care taken to ensure no damage.  The ream was just loose inside an oversized cardboard box.  The only option I was given was to send the ream of paper back which seems dumb to me.  You'd think manufacturer would be interested in damage and send me another ream.  I can get paper elsewhere in the future.

This trash is nowhere near “bright white.” I ordered this for a project my students are doing and the “white” snow on their pictures (you know, the part they don’t have to color) is IVORY. I had printed the second sheet for their projects onto white printer paper and now the two parts DO NOT MATCH and there’s no time to reorder cardstock that isn’t falsely advertised as bright white, nor do my local stores have any in stock. Sorry, kids. Y’all gonna have some yellowish snow on your projects that are worth TWO TEST GRADES. Very, very, VERY disappointed teacher over here.

Used this brand before with no problems. Cardstock is 1/16 of an inch too long, and caused a phantom jam in our church copy machine that no reset would fix. Copy machine repairman came and investigated and found the paper is not exactly the standard size, requiring some additional recalibration on the part of the machine. Minimum service fee is $261. Also, paper is not bright white, as stated on packaging, and as seen in photo attached (item in question on the top).

My card stock arrived timely but several of the sheets had peinting on them. I ordyplain white and that is not what i got. Very disappointed.

As soon as I put this in my printer started running super slow. It printed a few things and now it’s broken. That’s what I get for trying to save a few bucks on ink, I guess. Don’t be like me.

Disappointed to find it was a creamy color vs. a bright white.  The photo doesn't show the justice of it because of auto-correction, but the Tree-Zero on the right is a pure, bright white @ 92 brightness.  You can see the Neenah is yellow-ish as soon as you open the package.  Back it goes.

Paper does not work well in Printer. We only use thick paper and never have an issue however the alignment is hit or miss with this paper. would not recommend.

I had bought some BrightWhite 65lb. card stock from OfficeMax some years ago. It was labeled 96 brightness. It was WHITE and "Guaranteed to be in-stock"Went back to the store to buy more for my daughter's wedding programs and they no longer carried this. What they had was a 65lb card stock for about $12 for 100 with no mention of the brightness. Bought a package and when compared to the old BrightWhite, the paper looked like a dingy yellow.So, I cam to Amazon, found this "Bright White" product with a brightness of 96 for 250 sheets! What a deal.When the package arrived today, it was identical to the dingy yellow card stock I had just bought at OfficeMax and did not even come close to the white paper I had bought years ago.When compared to even white laser paper, this "Bright White" paper is a dingy yellow.

This is not bright white - it's ivory. And it's got more of a linen texture to it than it does a cardstock. I can't return it because I bought it as overstock for a project that is now being done. Too thick for regular letter usage, but not the right kind of cardstock for my regular projects.

Disappointed to open the packaging and find the cardstock (inside the plastic packaging!) was dirty, damaged and not white. Don't buy, waste of money.

Not the same as usual. What I received could not be called card stock it was nice presentation paper. It folded in half when held up and I could see my hand on the other side. I had one sheet left off my last pack of the same item and it did not compare.* I went to my local office supply store and purchased this same product and it was just as I remembered it. I'm not sure why the Amazon inventory has issues.

This paper is NOT bright white and is rather off white/yellow.  Out of return window as well!

Returned instantly,  not bright white  not as advertised

Upon opening th box  packaging  the paper was moving all over and packaging  was ripped.

This card stock was described as being Bright White.  It is not!  It is more of an off white/ cream color.  Neenah Bright White Card stock is on the right and white  card stock that I had and was trying to replenish is on the left.  Very disappointed in the advertisement of being Bright White.

So disappointed!! I bought this because I need white cardstock for scrapbooking and it says on the package "bright white". Although the weight is perfect, this is NOT bright white! This picture is showing the paper against plain printer paper! ugh!

Received late. Box was fine but paper appeared used and was dirty. Didn’t return due to health. Will not order again!

Received the package here. Hoping to print a nice laminated kids book, but the paper is not of good quality. It’s yellowish in the corners and not as bright as my regular printer paper.Not good. Going to buy good paper locally.

The box was torn, the plastic around the paper was torn and part of the stack of paper was crumpled.

Paper does seem to be good quality however when you order a gift for someone you don't want it ripped open and damaged like that .I had to take the entire package together because it was too close to xmas. Disappointing

This cardstock does not have a smooth finish. Both sides are course. Prints ok, but not for images or photos or blocks of color - other brands are smooth and printing looks more professional. Do not buy for presentations or graphic work. Very uneven finish.

Outside package was totally fine, but the ream was ripped open and most of the paper is unusable. Would like a refund bc I can’t use this

We ordered the paper thinking it would be bright white, but the color is Ivory event though it says Bright White on the package.

Paper ream arrived damaged, split open.

I’m very disappointed in the product. Compared to other paper I had been using, it was not as white and effected my print job. Look elsewhere.

Inaccurate description  - this paper is a cream color, not bright white, ,so needed to be returned.

I thought was more white than the one I have in my office but is not.

Said bright white but it has a cream finish.CreamColor cream not bright white

Received my cardstock and was damaged with bent corners and pink coloring . I want to make Christmas Card and sell at a craft fair but not in this condition. unusable. This needs to be fixed.

It is not bright white at all...it is a dull, very unappealing light cream with a hint of gray...to me, it is ugly and has no use. I thought that Neenah would be a reliable brand, but I am truly disappointed. Returning at once.

Sadly this paper just soaked up the ink from my Epson printer, and the result was color so muted I could not use it. Have a huge ream now and nothing to do with it since it prints terribly

I love this paper BUT this is the second time it has been delivered completely opened and damaged. Corners are bent and dirty!

I've bought this for years and the latest package I received is more of a cream color, not even close to bright white anymore. I'll be buying a different brand in the future.

The covering was ripped open and numerous pages were bent and unusable

The media could not be loaded.
                



It is horribleeeee to print in a laser printer!!!! You can literally scratch off the ink! Horrible!!!! First picture shows side by side a paper print(left) and the card stock(right)... it is not the printer! Is the card stock quality!

This product is not bright white. It is cream.

Don't let the description fool you. This isn't bright white, it's an off white.

This is FAR from bright white.  Save your money for a different brand.

Definitely not a bright white more like a cream white! When printing it does not do color well at all. Definitely won’t be ordering again

This is NOT even close to bright white. It’s a cream color.

My paper looks old and yellowish not what I was expecting maybe it was old and has been on the sun.

The this paper is NOT bright white!  I will Not buy again.

You can clearly see which one is white and which one is not. So disappointed. Now i can't even return them.

The paper is cream not white-I put a comparison photo and the paper with flowers is the card stock vs my other paper which is white.  You can see this is cream

This product is not a bright white (like regular paper).  I was disappointed and cannot use it for my project.

Product had been repackaged, was not a full ream of paper.  Very poor experience.

This paper is really nice and a great price but be aware it’s not actually white. It’s more of an off white.

I ordered this to produce some high quality prints and ended up having to use a different paper. This paper did nothing for the color. It was not as bright as I thought it would be. I have still been trying to figure out what to use the paper for since it seems it doesn't handle saturated images very well from an inkjet printer.

Despite the name and, this product is not bright white. I don't who gave it the 96 brightness rating, it's more of an egg shell off-white cream color.  Also the texture was not as smooth I expected.  If you want a true bright white smooth cardstock then pay a little more and buy the Accent Opaque White Cardstock Paper.

I ordered this as it says "Bright White", it is not. It is an off white in color. Next to a standard piece of white paper you can totally tell the difference. Not happy with it.

Color is different than products with similar white color rating (too yellowish) and not as thick compared to previously purchased paper with same weight (96)

I loved the price on this cardstock and the quality. What I didn’t appreciate was the condition I received it in. The wrapping was all torn during shipment I’m assuming, which damaged the corners of the paper.

I printed a test copy of a document, and everything looked great.  I then printed 35 copies, and by copy 3 or 4, the ink did not adhere to the paper. I then printed 35 copies on normal paper, and the printer worked well. I was using a Canon Imageclass color laser printer. So, if you just want to print something once in awhile, this paper would work. If you plan on printing dozens of copies on a standard home printer, I would look for something else

Bright white should be as white as you can get but this is a cream color that made my project look dingy and old. Very disappointed. Quality of cardstock is good but won’t be able to use it due to color

This paper is heavy weight like I wanted to print my planner but the paper is off white and dingy not bright white as listed

The paper I was sent is more cream white. The picture above is the product on the left under normal white copy paper.  I actually returned the first ream and requested a replacement thinking that I must've just gotten a bad batch. Apparently my definition of "bright white" differs from the company's.

This cardstock is advertised as Bright White however it is ivory or cream color cardstock. Not what I was looking for all at!

The package says Bright White - 96 Bright. It is not 96 white!  The color is very close to the paper that I have which is called "cream".

I was expecting a bright white cradstock. I got a warm, much lighter cardstock. Still, if this is the color white you are looking for great. But if you are looking for a true bright white, ie more in the cool brillance, this is not it.

I needed white card stock for a work project and I just could not use this. For me, it's noticeable, the paper is NOT white, its light beige. The quality is fine... but I should have read the reviews!

The product looks more cream than it does bright white. If you look at the picture, the card stock on the left is 92 Bright White compared to this Cardstock, which is advertised as 96 Bright a White.I struggled with the stars as the Cardstock product is what we expected except for the appropriate bright white color. For this reason, we will be returning.

This product is has a textured finish on the back side. It is also pretty yellow for being a 'bright white' paper.There are a couple of little specks embedded in the paper as well on pretty much every page.I don't recommend this paper.

I loved that the thickness of the paper goes through my printer as regular paper... but about every five pages in the package have smudges on the page so it's not a clear white page.  Very disappointed.

This paper came crinkled at corners and the paper has a yellow tint.

Unsure if it says it in the product, but one side is smooth and the other side is rough. Annoyed, didn't know i had to check for this.

Says bright white, but is more cream next to copy paper and other scrapbook paper.

Ive been buying these for years and suddenly in the last few months they are no longer bright white, but a dirty looking white/cream I would say.

Not all the paper in the pack was cardstock. part was as thin as regular printer paper.

NOT white. Between cream and ecru

This bright white looks yellow next to my other bright white paper. Very disappointing. Otherwise the paper weight and print quality is ok.

The package was ripped inside the delivery box. The box has no damage.

The product itself is great to use.  Very poor packaging of the cardstock paper itself, being ripped open and falling out of the ream.

I had been using this card stock for laser prints for several years.  When I got my last order, the quality of the paper was really rough and the laser printing rubs off.  I do not recommend this to anyone who used a laser printer.

Ordered bright white was yellow next to the bright white I had gotten before in another brand. Could not use it because made cards look dirty

The paper quality is very nice but it is not bright white in color.

The plastic on my ream of paper was already torn and opened upon arrival in the box.

The card stock is fine, but the packaging is terrible - every piece was damaged. Fortunately, I make greeting cards and cut most of it off.  The last batch was particularly bad - the card stock is simply put in a larger box - with NO padding or protection, when it arrives, the plastic covering on the card stock is completely destroyed and the edges all bent.

Compared to Neenah Classic Crest Cover Solar White 110 at 297 gsm, this cardstock is of course flimsy.  I do not use this for card bases (I make my own greeting cards), but I think it's perfectly fine for a card layer.  I also don't mind that it's slightly off-white compared to Neenah solar white 97 brightness.

This was not Bright White. The color was more matte eggshell/off-white. It looked old, dingy, and faded. I needed to used it immediately so I didn't return it. Previously, I have purchased it from other vendors and it was vibrant, clean, bright white. Disappointed.

The quality of this paper is good but I'm very disappointed in the brightness. At a 96 out of 100 and Bright White" labeled on the wrapper, I expected a distinct white but both reams I ordered had a definite cream tinge to them when paired with regular copy paper with a lower brightness rating.

I didn't love because the white is not white enough for me. It is a little "dirt" white... I didnt love but it ok, I am using but I wll not buy it again

When I stacked it with my other white cardstock you can tell a difference and it's more off white in comparison. Shame because it's a good deal and good quality

IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE WHEN I RECEIVED IT.  IT IS THICK, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE FOR OF A SUTTLE GLOSS FINSH THANK A MATTE FINISH. WHEN PRINTING ART PROJECT IT DOEN'T PROJECT THE DESIGNS AS CLEAR AS ON OTHER PAPER.

Bought 2 packages and BOTH came with the bottoms completely ripped open!

The paper is NOT "bright".  My 92 bright white copy paper is brighter than this card stock.  This "Bright White" card stock has a creamy tinge to it.

The quality of this paper is good but there is no way this can be called bright white. I've purchased 4 reams and they were all a yellowish ivory. If you're looking for a true white paper, look elsewhere.

Poor quality

I bought this for making greeting cards, but it is much too thin.  The cardstock that I've purchased at WalMart is much better quality at a similar price.

This product is light cream colored, and not bright white as advertised. I am very disappointed. Bright white shouldn't have yellow tones in it.

We tried this cardstock to make greeting cards but nearly one third of the sheets were not usable because of serious wrinkles pressed into them.

Ugh!  I took a chance despite some negative reviews.  It's OK.  It is definitely thicker than regular paper but I've bought nicer cardstock at big box store.  Won't buy this brand again.

I just ordered TEN packages of this cardstock and while I give 5 stars to the product, EVERY PACKAGE was open!!! Wow!

Paper is not bright white. It is more off white, slightly ivory.

The color of this cardstock is almost yellow, especially in comparison to the white copy paper and other bright white  products I use. I will never buy it again when I want WHITE cardstock.

The one on top is the white one I already have. The yellow in the Neenah packaging is the supposed to be a Bright White. Hah.

Nice heavy stock and perfectly white. I'm using this stock to make playing card prototypes. Works very well for that when laminated.

Great quality card stock. Perfect thickness and weight for multiple printed projects. Great value!

I considered buying other brands, but I read reviews and the Neenah brands seemed to get the most positive vibes.  It is nice a bright white and it has a nice finish.  My Brother ink jet printers prints nicely on it.  I did find that it helps when loading the paper to bend the paper upward, ever so slightly, when placing it in the paper tray.  That seems to help the feeding rollers pick it up better.

good paper, good texture , works well

I make note cards using my original art, and most of my art is printed on this paper for nice, crisp printing.  I also use it to draw my art on, and it works well for that, too.  Have reordered many times.

Appears a creamy yellowish color - definitely not the Bright White that is claimed in product description, In the photo the larger piece is this Neenah Premium Cardstock,  upper portion of photo is my printer paper, and the Scallop Circle is cut from another brand's Bright White cardstock.  I'm giving 4 Stars because it is not a bright white as description states.  Other than that it is as described.

Nice card stock. This is a multiple purchase. This is the only card stock I use. Very nice weight and prints up beautifully.

I use these card stocks for crafting and is great. Cost per sheet is great. Perfect thickness. Will purchase again.

Well, if this card stock was really white, I would’ve probably given it a 5.  Other than the deceptive name, I’m sure anybody who’s purchased it before is not expecting it to be white  I have a few sheets from their multi pack of different colors and that one is whiter. The reason I got it is because the good one, accent brand has Recently increased in price, like double!  So I’m saving that one for Card bases and using this for the sentiments or diecuts.  I made a mistake and used this one for a card base the other day, And the other side of the two sided paper was showing through this Card stock! So I don’t recommend it for card bases.  It’s only 65 pound.  But for printing out sentiments and cutting die cuts, it works perfectly. So I’m almost perfectly happy with it.  The off-white color doesn’t match my card base, So I have to try and disguise that.

This is my go-to cardstock for printing flyers for my non-profit volunteer gig with a national veterans group. It is just the right weight for this purpose, and I have used probably 10 reams of it in the last year alone! It is also wonderful for laminating after printing and makes your projects look and feel super professional. This cardstock makes me look good! :) I'll be ordering more!

I was disappointed in how this paper held up for making posters. I make posters regularly for my Blues Band. They seem to curl up a bit after placing them at our next venue and don't stay flat. I would look elsewhere if you intend this paper for making professional posters.

This paper is not bright white as stated but a creamy off white! So just note if you buy it you cannot tell the true color until you open the package.

The product is good; however, it arrived in a box that had scars from a perilous journey.  When I opened the box, the paper had come off the product itself and some of the cardstock had bent corners from moving around in the marred box.  This is the first time that I have had a problem with shabby packaging.  Hopefully, this won't happen again.

I ordered this because I needed bright white card stock, which is stated on the package, however it is a cream color.  So that was a disappointment.

Advertised as Bright White (96), very dull white, (almost a tint of yellow in color).Useless to me.

I was hoping to print my menus with this cardstock.  When it cam I was not impressed.  It is not very white

I've been using this same style and brand for years.  Recent purchase had cardstock that was smooth only on one side but the other side was heavily textured.  We print on both sides so I returned it but the second shipment was mostly the same.  About 1/5 was useable with smooth on both sides, the rest was textured and can't be used.  I guess I will need to find another source or wait to see if the bad quality lot either sells out or is pulled for bad quality.

I will find a use for this, however when I hold this next to my other white cardstock, it’s very clearly NOT bright white . It like a light cream color

You can rub the print off and smear it.  I am using a professional Kyocera p3160dn and the paper feeds nicely and meets all requirements but the print does not stick to the page.  The description should not encourage those with laser printers to buy this paper.  It is misleading.  I am sure it works well for ink printers as the paper looks and feels great.

There is a huge variance in the thickness of the paper.  When that happens, the printer has difficulty producing a quality printed item as the sheet is 2 to 3 times thicker that the specification.

This paper is more off white than bright white. Another brand on the left (the one I'm holding), this brand in the middle and regular copy paper on the right....you can see the difference in shade. The sturdiness is great. The color I'm disappointed in.

Very disappointed. Was looking for a bright white card stock, and this was not bright. It was an off white color. I was not able to finish a project I needed to- as the colors with the paper I had did not match. Unfortunate.

This supposedly "bright white" cardstock is not a true white. It's actually more of a yellowish off-white and makes all the colors in my project look muted and dull. So disappointed. Back to square one..

Though labeled "bright white" this is definitely more ivory than white.

One package only had half the amount of paper as the other two

The paper seems like good quality. It has texture and seemed thick enough. I had to send it back since my entire ream came ripped open and dented.

This paper is a lot darker than I expected. Compared to the Hammermill paper I also bought, this paper is significantly darker. Disappointed.

The Neenah is not nearly as white as I expected for a 96 brightness rating.  It looks yellow next to other white card stock I had left on the shelf. I won't buy again and regret buying 2 pkgs.

The corners of the card stock are bent up on about 20 sheets!  They are unusable!Perhaps it happened in shipping because there was no padding around the product, so it moved around in your box.I won't order again by mail.

I found the paper to be inferior to what it claims. The Neenah is thinner and not near as white as the 150 sheets for less than 6 dollars. I won't buy again and regret buying 2 pkgs.

I like the feel and weight and price of this paper. But it is not Bright White as advertised. This is a cream color, definitely off-white. It still was nice and I kept it because my project could use this shade. But if I was doing something that required white paper, then this would not work.

Holding this next to the other Neenah paper I have, it's easy to see that it is NOT Bright White. Would love to return but it's opened, maybe I'll try anyway.

Paper on the left is this paper.  Listed as “bright white”.  It has a very noticeable yellow off white tint.

Surface of this card stock is dull, not shiny.  A printed page looks less vivid using this product.

I already left feedback regarding the packaging; not sure if Amazon or the seller is to blame, but the box was crumpled and the corners on probably two dozen sheets were ruined.As far as quality, it's okay.  The paper is a bit on the yellow side when compared to good quality drawing pads, but admitedly this is just for my print requirements in graphic design.  The weight serves its purpose for dummy sheets/mock-ups and the paper responds well to inkjet printing, but in the future, I'll probably go with something a little heavier, especially for double-sided print projects.

Two corners (whole package) are crimped. If you need this to be perfect and mar-free, I would suggest purchasing locally to you so you control them quality of the product. FTMP, I will be using this not whole so it doesn’t matter too much.

I ordered this cardstock in order to use it for card making. I own an Etsy shop where I sell my art and I wanted to start printing my art onto cards to sell. This paper is not made for fine art printing (which I expected at the price) and my biggest problem was that the paper is incredibly THIN. I was surprised how thin. I was hoping for something sturdier.I think if you're looking for thin white cardstock then this is for you, but it didn't suit my purposes.

I bought this to use for calligraphy. It seeps—it's extremely absorbent—so it's completely unworkable with sumi ink. It's ok for watercolor, surprisingly, better if there's a pencil outline, and if it doesn't need to look entirely exact. It absorbs almost instantly, too, so if color isn't blended, the first spots placed are darker and cannot be fixed.

I was hoping this would be a bright white color as advertised but it is not. It has cream tone to it. : (

Although it prints quite well on the photo quality setting (on my Canon 9000 printer) The thickness of the paper is not up to greeting card quality.  It curls and feels flimsy.  I was looking for something comparable to the Avery greeting card stock but without cuts or scoring. It will work OK for collage or scrapbooks. I used it to make a large number of gift tags but I'm still looking for greeting card stock.

This paper would of been perfect if it was truly bright white and not yellow tone paper

It's off white almost super light yellow. Not at all the color I expected for this BRIGHT WHITE.

I was expecting the cardstock to be a bit heavier, but it's on me for not researching the numbers/weight issue.  It's great quality paper tho... just wish it was heavier.  I used it for a pennant banner that I hung up for an outdoor party... it did the job.  Great value for the price.

This isn't bright white. It has a yellow tint to it and is closer to an off white. The quality is great though. I use it in my Silhouette Cameo to make price tags and labels for packaging. It cuts smoothly and folds nice and crisp.

It's definitely not Bright white more like a off white... It doesn't print as vibrant as I'd hoped! but it is pretty thick & sturdy so this could be god depending on what you need it for

printing was good quality, however it was not a bright white paper

That this would be good for making cards, to lite weight, but had to keep it as return shipping is almost the same price I paid for it.

It is more of a yellowish color.  For what I need it, it serves the purpose.  But if you need a true white, this is not the product for you.

Not really cardstock. VERY flimsy. Frayed edges. Linty. If you're ok with D+ grade paper, which you get alot of for $10. Go for it. But this is not serious cardstock paper.

I received this package in the mail and the inside package was damaged.  It was taped back together with scotch tape, which was unusual.  I don't think anything cardstock was missing.  This is the first time that I have ordered cardstock and it has been this damaged.

Compare to other brand, its a cream color. Not bright white....

I like this cardstock, and it is great quality for the money. BUT, if you are looking for true white, be aware that this cardstock is quite a cream color, not white.  But I will use it happily!

Nice and sturdy for the project I was doing.

Good quality but I thought it would of been a brighter white than it was

Packaging was open in the delivery book and some of the ends were bent. The pink color from the packaging was faded a little on the paper. The paper itself is good quality but I may not go with this brand again due to the issues I mentioned.

Not a fan of the warm white tone.  So I'm going to try Neenah's solar white instead.

Seems light weight compared to other 65lb cardstock I have purchased.

Good buy—weight is nice.  Used for nameplates.

Works well with inkjet printers. And also for craft.

Description states "Bright White" it is not white, more of a creamy beige color.

I like the thickness of this cardstock. Its sturdy but doesn't clog up my printer. it isn't a bright white though, compared to printer paper. Its more of a creamy colored white. Its not a deal breaker but kind of annoying. I kept it though.

First and foremost, this is nice paper and it came in a box so it is in pristine condition. But, it is more paper than cardstock. I purchased Astrobrights (which is the newer name for Neenah bright white) and although the numbers and GSM are the same the astrobrights feels thicker.  I would not call this cardstock but good paper. I will keep it and use it to make copies instead of the intended use (as a layer in my handmade cards, because it just feels too thin for that) I will continue to search for good, smooth bright white card stock that is 80-85 lbs (GSM of 200+) because the 65lbs are too flimsy

It looks white but not as bright as it could be.

Don’t get me wrong, this is a great value for sturdy card stock. And most of the time I only need to print single sided. But I couldn’t find anything that said whether this was single or double sided. Since purchase I have decided that the print quality on one side isn’t as nice as the other. So go ahead and buy this product if you need only single side printing but if double is needed this isn’t the product for you.

This particular 65lb cover stock is slightly larger than Accent Opaque and we had to readjust our paper folder and paper cutter settings to achieve precision folded notecards. It's also not quite as white as Accent Opaque. Paper texture is smooth and printing quality is excellent. However, we will be switching back to 65lb Accent Opaque when it again becomes available. A definite plus: each ream of Neenah card stock is packaged in sturdy clear wrap that remains intact during shipping.

Would of given them more stars but The paper wasn’t White it was more of an Cream color

Good deal on cardstock for our 1st grade teacher gift

Thinner than traditional card stock but fine for what I needed and it worked perfectly with my inkjet printer. No jams at all! Nice bright white color. Colored print and pictures looked great!

Good quality cardstock paper.

I was using this to print program covers for my son's Eagle Scout Court of Honor.  It has a really night brightness, and a wonderful smooth finish.This is pretty thick for my Brother Color Laser printer, so when I used the duplexing feature it left some lines one side.  I was able to work around this by manually duplexing.  I.E., I printed all of one side in one batch, and then flipped the output correctly into the tray.  I think some of the issue may have been how smooth the finish is.

Card stock should be measured by the standard basis size (500 sheets at 20"x26", also called 'cover' size) for reporting its pound weight.  This paper, Wausau Bright Wight, correctly bills itself as "65 lb" and "176 g / sq m".  The grams per square meter is unambiguous as there's no trickery about what size sheet is weighed, but unfortunately Amazon doesn't seem to list those weights on most cardstock.Other products bill themselves as 'Index' - , like the Neenah Exact Index stock, bill themselves at e.g. 110 lb - which should be nearly twice as heavy as this product.  It's not, it's only about 1/8th heavier, at 199 g / sq m.  They are using the larger "Index" size (500 sheets at 30.5"x25.5") to be able to report a much higher weight in comparison.Kudos to this product for accurately reporting its weight.

I was out of stockIt looks good and I hope I will like it

I buy bright white from a different distributor but I needed 65lb for my new Hp Color Laser printer.  The paper is great in every way and does the job I need it to do BUT it is not bright white.  If it is, then it is the dullest of all the bright whites I buy from other makers.  I'll still get much use out of the ream but will not be able to use for my graphic images I print out to hand-color which is the main reason I bought it.

Great paper but not a crisp bright white. A little disappointed it wasn't bright white as described.

THE PRODUCT WAS GOOD BUT THE WRAPPING WAS TORN

Great quality cardstock, but I was hoping to use for my wedding invitations and it just won't work. When put next to other white paper or white envelopes, this is obviously an off-white color. Even on its own, it doesn't give the clean, crisp look you'd expect from a white cardstock.

It is the best I could find for the money

Neenah makes great paper. But I had to deduct one star just because I feel the "bright white" label is misleading. The color is more a matte eggshell - which is OK. But compared to Hammermill 60lb Color Copy Digital Cover Stock (whose price had increased on Amazon, so I choose this instead), it looks dull and barely white at all. Don't choose this product if your project calls for a more brilliant white. Will be searching elsewhere for a better price on the Hammermill.

I got this paper for the price. It said bright white so I assumed it was...well...white. It has more of an ivory tint. This could have been an error on my part for assuming that bright white meant white but who knows. I gave the ream to my daughter who loves to draw so it worked out either way.

It was of average sturdiness but it was not “bright white” as advertised. It is off white, and not what I wanted but I could not return it.

I got this hoping it would serve as a thicker paper that would still have a photo like finish. I use it to make cubees and have been using kodak photo paper, but that tends to run a little pricey so was looking for a good alternative. The paper is fine has a good thickness and everything, but for my preferences and what I was doing, this was the wrong choice. The colors are washed out looking and don't have that crispness I was personally looking for.

It’s not white. It’s like light yellow or something like that.

The quality of this cardstock is good for making your own greeting cards. My issue is about a fourth of the package won't be usable because it was damaged . The inside package was torn open on one corner and may have even been put in the box that way without being checked. Where the package  is torn all those sheets are bent so badly they can't be salvaged. So my 250 sheets will actually be under 200 usable sheets..

Bought these for my DIY wedding things... ie: Menus, place cards, tags, etc etc... and the stock is nice.Thick enough that its better than printing on regular paper but not so thick you need to go somewhere to get it professionally printed.I would probably categorize this with resume stock paper but at a better price and with no watermark.Im a fan and happy with the purchase.I was just pissed that the corner was banged up a bit so my first 10 sheets of paper arent quite perfect.

I thought this paper would be thicker. I’ve bought this weight before and I swear it was thicker in the past. It’s fine enough but just know it’s not so sturdy.

Good quality paper. Good for home use. I do wish it was a bit whiter. Compared to printing paper, it it much more cream colored.

My kids love to make cards for their friends' birthdays. I bought the card-making kit but it was expensive and included things they never used like cardboard shape cutouts. So instead I bought this card stock, some nice markers and some nice stickers. Now I fold one of these in half for them and let them go to town. Saves a lot of money too!

I love this cardstock. My one complaint is that the ink bleeds if it get any moisture which may or may not be the fault of the product. I have only used this brand so I cannot really speak to whether this is a common problem with cardstock. Otherwise, I love it and will keep ordering unless someone tells me about a better product.

It is nice white but not knock your eye out white stock and works well for cards and tags. I was really hoping for a heavier stock to make decorative boxes for my home made lotions, body bars and bath bombs. But this is quality stock and even though I hoped the card stock would be heavier weight it still makes nice tags and cards.

Wasn’t “bright white”. It was more eggshell/creamish which was ok but wouldn’t buy again if I was looking for bright white.

bought the paper as a cheap alternative to photo paper, and the results are quite good.  just make sure to set your printer to matte paper, and best photo printing settings, and you should be satisfied with the results.  I also used Epson Archival Matte paper, but it was too expensive for my needs, so I will stay with Neenah cardstock!!!

Reasonably priced for what it is, and compared to buying reams locally.

I like the quality. For me this is thicker than some other card stock I've purchased for the price.  I use it to print kids puzzles or games I want to reuse and did notice you can see through it so I will try using draft mode when I print on it next time.

Great for postcards and flyers but a bit thirsty.

Papers is more white off than white but great quality I end up buying target brand was more white than this one and about the same price.

Needed a nice bright white cardstock for the front covers of our proposals.  This is perfect.

FAST SERVICE AND PRICETHIS WAS USED FOR SCHOOL IM A TEACHER

The card stock is great quality. As a teacher I use a lot of card stock. It’s great for bulletin boards, games and letters.

Other card stock was to heavy to use in my printer

Bought this pack of paper multiple times. I like the color and thickness. Prints well

Used to make program fans for wedding. They held up nicely. Also used for other things solid paper.

Great for work project

As a caricature artist, I almost exclusively draw on cardstock.  These are stiff and very bright and hold the marker ink very well.  I'm used to paying much more than this from the local office supply store so I'm stocking up!

The paper is very durable and high quality. I use it for my interior design classes to draw renderings and I won't switch - highly recommend.

Really good quality paper. Cuts really well using my Cricut cutter. I love it!

Nice card stock, worked well with inkjet printer!

I use these with my paper cutter and it works like a dream! Easy to weed and to use!

I believe this is my 2nd order for cardstock.  I normally use to make and print my own greeting cards and other things.  It works great in my Epson printer, no issues with print quality.

I use so much #65 White paper for print in cut images, cards and layered projects

Good paper.

good price

I’ve purchased this several times on Amazon. I love the weight of the paper and how well the paper is made.

Perfect.  Works As Described.  My Go-To.

purchased for craft project, worked great

This is not too thick and not too thin.  Perfect for printing and laminating.

Product was just as advertised.

I’ve spent so much money on super expensive white cardstock with only a handful of sheets in the pack. This by far exceeds my expectations and will be purchasing this from now on!

I have shopped card stock nearly everywhere. This particular product is the best "bang for your buck". I use this cardstock regularly from my home printer. No issues printing and it holds up well!

I like this weight of cardstock and purchase it when I get low on supplies. It's smooth and not too heavy, just right for making greeting cards.

Great product!! I used this to make Quinceañera cards!!! The card stock was not to thick perfect for the printer.

I love this paper. (Neenah Premium Cardstock, 8.5" x 11", 65 lb/176 gsm, Bright White, 250 Sheets (91904), since sometimes there has been a couple variations show up to choose from) It is much whiter than the cheap paper I ordered previously and much heavier though it's still mid ground IMO. My printer was an old piece of junk several years old and I wasn't sure if it could handle such a heavy paper, but it did, and pretty easily, at that!I use this to print coloring pages on, and it is just heavy enough that even applying a few layers of markers, it isn't bleeding through though I think another layer or two, and it might. Strangely, on the cheap paper, the old inkjet ink, even letting the page sit for several hours, markers and even colored pencils would smear the lines. I was over-eager to test this paper out, so I printed (with the same old printer), and I  -immediately- colored on the picture with markers and colored pencils that smeared before... And remarkably, it didn't smear at all. Of course, someone else's results may vary as we'd almost certainly have different printers and ink used, but yeah, this is really nice paper.

The weight of the cardstock is perfect. It's thick enough that I ran off certificates for students and did some acrylic painting on it, but not so thick that it hung in my printer (some of the heavier weights have caused jams in the past). The color is not pure white. Almost has a cream or slightly off-white color to it.

nice quality.  works well for my needs.

Great quality paper. Very thick.

I use this product to make greeting cards

I run a golf league and often the official,perforated, USGA card stock us not available. Using this product is a good substitute, only have to gut to the proper size

Good quality Cardstock!Very white and bright!Very useful for many things.I use it to make cards with, to make patterns to trace and to make color copies with printer among other things.

I use a lot of cardstock in my classroom, and this is my go-to for white cardstock.  It is bright and the perfect weight.  It feeds through my printer with no problems and holds up well for many purposes.  I have purchased this multiple times and anticipate I will continue to do so for many years to come.

I bought these in an arts and crafts store before, in a smaller package, and was delighted to see they came in a ream. They are perfect for printing out invitations, greeting cards, flash cards and games boards. Very good for children to practice cutting shapes and straight lines (better than cutting printer paper, which does not hold its shape well). Good quality. Consistent results. Will certainly re-order.

This cardstock was exactly what I needed for a tagging project for a consignment sale.  My home epson printer printed on it just fine and it was sturdy and clear.  Happy with this paper.

This card stock always arrives in perfect condition. Iam happy with it. I print lots of documents and color on these and have never ran into an issue.

This Neenah 65lb cardstock is perfect for printing adult coloring pages I've purchased on Etsy. I use it primarily for coloring with alcohol markers because it's smooth with very little tooth. You can use colored pencils on this as well, but I use a different type of paper for that. It works very well with my HP Envy Pro 6400 printer; the images come out sharp and crisp.  It's a shame that it only comes with 250 sheets, unlike the Neenah bristol vellum paper, which has 325 sheets. But this cardstock is exactly what I was looking for to use with my alcohol markers. I will continue to purchase this for sure.

I recently got into some DIY projects, and this Neenah Premium Cardstock has been an absolute game-changer. The  weight is just perfect – sturdy enough for my crafty creations, but not so thick that my printer throws a tantrum. The bright white color and the smooth texture gives my prints that professional look. If you're into crafting or printing, this paper is a great choice.

The paper is easy to work with.

I can cut this cardstock without ruining my blades. The rag paper that comes from China is horrible. This is quality cardstock made by an American plant. This is 65lb cardstock which is what I needed. Happy with this purchase.

I've run out of card stock, and instead of running to a craft store, I decided to order this.  It works great for my cards, and inking trials.  It folds well (if you have a bone folder), and stands up to a lot of weight.

I make all my own greeting cards and this cardstock is perfect for Stampin-Up cards, Silhouette cut out cards and Hallmark computer printer cards.

I bought this paper and it jammed every time.  Thinking it was my printer gone bad I replaced it and bought a brand new one three months later.  Used the same paper and brand new printer gives me an error that there’s a paper jam.  I tried again and again same issue.  I used a different paper and it print perfectly.  I have a whole ream of paper I cannot use.  Not happy at all with the quality.  I’ll just go to staples and get their brand.

I bought this because it claims it is made in the USA but when you get the package it doesn't say that.  It reads in small print.  May be manufactured in the USA or distributed by USA.  This way you are paying top dollar for it to be manufactured in USA but is probably manufactured in China like everything else.  So sick of not being able to buy American products and don't appreciate being mislead.

I never thought I would be writing a review for paper, but I can't help mentioning that this paper is noticeably thinner than typical 20 lb stock, and the show-through for double-sided printing is horrible. 20-lb weight paper is the normal, which I've used before from many manufacturers, but this particular kind seems much thinner. I hate getting a huge box, but I will stick to Costco going forward. On the attached photos, the color elements are only printed on one side. This stuff is going in the recycle bin.

I own an HP printer so I thought hey HP paper should work great. Constantly the printer says there is no paper in it when it is half full of this paper. Then when I get it full, the first 3 tries jam each time. I remove this paper go with a different brand and no issues. Even if there is one piece of paper left from a different brand the printer sees it. Not sure what is up with this paper, but I am now stuck with 2200 sheets of paper.

We just got our paper today and noticed the paper is not cut evenly and is not the same white color.  Every few pages are cut shorter than the ones before, through the entire ream.  Also, half the stack is a different color white. We only opened 1 ream, but this is not acceptable! I will not order this paper again!

I love HP paper and we used it at the office for years. This isn’t a problem with HP. It is a problem with warehouse workers who obviously dropped the package. It’s split open and roughed up the edges and even the paper looks a little dirty on the bottom, I need to copy your paper now so I can’t return it, but I wanted to report that it didn’t come in good condition and that’s a little upsetting to me.

I ordered this paper because the one I typically order wasn't available. It is terrible paper that jams my printer everytime I use it. I didn't realize HP made such a poor quality printer paper. It's going in the trash.

I opened the ream of paper I discovered that the top 25 sheets of paper were unusable. There is a line down the middle and what looks like water stains almost like the paper was stuck in a machine. I am disappointed that HP Copy & Print 20 was sent out damaged.

I have never had an issue with low print quality. It is an HP printer and I've had it for about 6 months. Suddenly the first time I use HP's own paper, it prints one page really poorly, and then completely quits working. A head cleaning did nothing but waste colored ink. The black cartridge that was 60% full is now useless.Furthermore, the packaging is worthless. As someone who prints 1-4 pages/mo, I obviously can't fit the entire 500 page ream in my printer. My expectation is to keep most of it in the packaging to prevent damage. Instead, within seconds of opening this package the entire thing split down the side and spilled all over the floor.I am of the personal opinion that corporate giants like HP do things like this intentionally to force users to waste product and have to buy more sooner. Whether that is true is debatable, but I see far too many gimmicks that point to this kind of behavior from companies like HP. I will not be buying HP paper or printers in the future.

I purchased a pallet (40 cases) of 8.5 x 11, 20lb paper from Amazon.  I use it to print books.  I am about 1/3 through the pallet, and I am noticing the STRANGEST thing.  In the last 10 reams I have opened, some of the paper is a different size.  Most of the pieces are 8.5 x 11, but every 4th or 5th piece of paper is smaller about 1/16th of an inch smaller than the other pieces.  Doesn't sound significant, but it is when I go to bind the books.  Now, I have to check EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER in the ream before I can print.  So frustrating.I have purchased HP paper for 20 years, but never from Amazon.  I'm wondering if HP sells this paper on Amazon because it is inferior or if this just a fluke?I've contacted HP support twice, but have heard nothing back, so I decided to post my review here.

i was very dissatisfied with the refund amount i was given. i  called and complain and no action was taken i open  the package and had to return same. i would like to have this  problem solved Thanks

I just got a new printer and ordered some paper too because I was out. I opened the paper up and the paper is unusable. Something red/pink was spilled on the paper and it dried. Frankly… I’m grossed out a bit because… what was spilled?!?!? What am I touching that was red/pink?!?! And, how do you return a damaged ream of paper? SMH Sure, here, take my money for nothing!

Good paper but shipped poorly and about 1/2 inch total of paper is unusable in printer because bent and crushed.

I am very disappointed with the product I received. I ordered a while back but did not need to start using it until recently and unfortunately didn't pay attention to what the boxes said. What I received was not HP; it was Boise X9 paper from Boise White Paper LLC. The paper isn't even close to ultra white, and even though it says it's 20#, the texture of it is such that my Brother office printer/copier pulls through multiple sheets at a time. I have wasted a lot of paper because it's printing on the edges of multiple sheets, which then can't be reused. I have to print my documents all over again because they're not printing fully on one page. Even when the print job prints cleanly, it still pulls through extra sheets, which also means my tray is emptying much faster than it should be. In a nutshell, I'm wasting both time and money. I went away from Office Depot because of some customer service issues, but I may have to go back to them because the paper I used to get from them was at least good quality! This paper is not, and why I was shipped Boise paper when I ordered HP paper is beyond me.

You can see an impression going down the center of the paper where the paper manufacturing machine ran it through.  The sides of the paper are curled which indicates poorly stored or has been on the shelf for years.

This paper is bigger than stated size and will not work for HP printers.

I know what I'm buying with regard to the paper and its quality. It serves its purpose as it should. However, consistently Amazon is shipping damaged paper. The box comes in terrible shape and there is ALWAYS at least one ream that is broken open and dirty. This box of paper feels like it has been bathed in a sandstorm.If the boxes of paper are too heavy for the handlers, perhaps someone needs to break them down into two boxes and double pack them.I order paper from Amazon to save time. But something needs to change in the handling so that the product is not damaged in the shipping.

Why is it when I order the 5-ream pack of this paper, it seems thinner and flimsier than when I order the 3-ream pack?  I like to give my customers my best, and this flimsy paper is being passed off as the same quality as the 3-pack.  What gives?????  Not happy about this and it's too late to send it back because I am under a deadline to my customers.

This is terrible paper. It has no rigidity and feels too thin. I copied a single page of music and found it just slipped right off my music stand. I ran it over the edge of a table to try to straighten it and it was no better. Now I've just copied a 7-page composition, stapled it together, and it has the same problem.I've been buying paper for 60 of my 75 years, and never had this problem before. I will trust the manufacturer that it is actually 20 lb., but it just does not behave like it. I can't figure out what the problem is. Some sort of cost-cutting in the mills, no doubt. I've also noticed that paper prices generally have gone up. Forest fires? Covid? Profiteering?  All three?

This is honestly the crappiest copy/printer paper I've ever purchased! Since I'm mostly printing stuff just for myself and not for clients or presentations these days (in quarantine), I figured I didn't need the typical heavy, bright paper I used to get when I worked in an office. However, the quality of this paper is SO POOR, I really wish I'd just spent a couple extra dollars to get normal quality paper.It's so thin/flimsy that when I print double-sided (which is most of the time), I can easily see the opposite side of the page's words coming through, even without holding it up to the light. And the "brightness" is so dull, it has an almost gray cast to it. Really only usable as scrap paper. Do yourself a favor and stick with the 24 weight/96 bright standard paper stock. It really does make a difference!

I ordered 6 boxes of this paper, and apparently the delivery folks are angered when someone orders boxes of this heavy paper, because the boxes arrived in very bad shape, beaten up worse than I've ever seen an Amazon delivery.  Some of the paper was crinkled on the edges because of this, which makes those sheets unsuitable for most uses.  It looked like someone had rolled the boxes 100 yards down a sidewalk or something.  The boxes were filthy black and broken open along the cardboard edges, held together only by the strapping tape.  To make matters worse, after being en route for nearly a month, one of the 6 boxes still hasn't arrived.  I assume that is because it was so severely abused that it broke open and all of the paper spilled out.  Buyer beware!  If you need copier paper that's not crumpled, I think you're better off going to a store and buying it in person.

When I use this my printer shows out of paper

Updating this review after a few more days of experience with this paper.PROS:Arrived safe - no damage, wrapper in-tact. (Guess I was one of the lucky ones).CONS:Extremely thin paper. Practically "see-through".No good for two-sided print - bleeds through to point of practically unreadable.Paper-jams happen too easily / frequently, and creates smudges. (And I'm using an HP LaserJet Pro)It's nothing like the original HP "Everyday Copy & Print" paper from years before.It is obvious that tons of the "5-star" reviews were bought & paid for through a service that offers to help boost ratings and drive-down actual real reviews that contain these true critiques of this terrible paper.Don't waste your money on this paper, no matter how cheap they price it. Huge disappointment.

When the product arrived, plastic was broken and opened, half of the paper was crumbled. Very unpleasant with the service.

Jams the hell outa my printer

So disappointed with this purchase.  I'm use to HP selling quality products, but, this was not one of them.  The paper is so thin and of very cheap quality.I'm sending it back and looking for a more quality paper product.

I have been purchasing this paper for a while now, with  no issues.  However, this batch is awful.  Paper has bent edges, curls and more than half is wasted.  It sticks in my printer every single time.  Never had this problem before and do not have it with other paper I am using.  I doubt I will buy again.  Very, very disappointed.

delivered to us distracted and paper too thin

Ordered the two pack - one was recycled and very dingy

While the quality of the copy paper is good the packaging was horrible. The package the paper is in was sliced open on two sides  and some of the paper out of the packaging. While I could have returned the  paper it wasn’t worth my time to drive to the UPS store to return an item for $7.13. Like I said the quality of the paper is good I feel Ike a refund without a return would have been the Igor thing.

Photocopying did not work well with this product at all, because it kept bending and jamming the printer, whereas other paper does not. I had to spend money having my printer unjammed, and made ready to work again - I was disappointed.

The paper quality is very thin and jams my printer.  I have a HP printer so I thought that the HP paper will work.  I've wasted many sheets of paper and it's frustrating.  Confirm appropriate paper usage with your printer before purchase.

The HP copy paper we received is not the same quality as before, whereas the copy paper is usually smooth and bright this is dull and feels almost like construction paper, yet it is in HP wrapping.  The HP copy paper has never been of this quality before.  Not sure if this is a new seller.

I have an HP printer. I thought I couldn't go wrong with HP paper, I WAS wrong. This paper is almost see-through it is so thin. It jams in the printer  constantly. Embarrased to give anyone anything printed on this paper because the quality is so poor. It makes better tissue paper than printer paper.  I will never purchase again.

I ordered 20 w paper . I had ordered it before with no problem . I tried to use it in my computer ( bought some time ag but business has been closed since March 2020 so had not opened it. Opening in July so needed to print and it would not work in the printer. I felt of the paper and realized why. It is so thin. I compared it to the other 20 weight ( SAME BRAND THAT i JUST USED UP)with measurement and its 1/2 as thick. THIS IS NOT 20 WEIGHT PAPER

I did not like that both the box the paper came in and the paper packaging in my last two shipments was damaged.  So far the paper inside seems to work okay in my printer.  I am not a fan of subscribe and save since I was charged more for this shipment than for the prior shipement.  paper shipements are too heavy for me to return, so, hopefully, the paper will continue to work okay. The last Subscribe and Save shipement was also damaged!  Clean up your act, Amazon!

Really HP????A ream has always been 500 sheets. When did a ream become 400 sheets???Yes, the description, not the title, does specify a 'ream of 400 sheets.' But who questions the word REAM when it comes to office supply paper? Obviously I will now. We feel short-changed and will be paying extra attention from now on.This experience reminds me of when ice cream half gallons went down in size, just enough for you to not pay attention at the store... But you were charged the same price as half gallons used to be priced. You get home, and hey, what happened to my half gallon?We suspect corporate cunning - as another one-star reviewer called it.Poor form HP.

Sad that product was shoved in among reams of paper, and this case does not have a full reams but "packs".

Wow what a rip off.  Each pack is less than 500 pages and the tiny box only holds 2,400.  Imagine we are an office and always by from the major stationary outlets where a ream of paper is standard at 500 sheets and a box of ten is 5,000 sheets.  I thought I was order 11X14 so I paid the price at 29.00, but when it came I was disappointed.  I pay 29.00 for the box of 5,000 8.5X11 all the time from Quill or others.  I tried to return it and the return mailed to me said it would cost something like $26 for a UPS pickup.  I had to suck it up and keep it.  Will never buy again.

I have been using this paper for color prints, some how the paper quality is not good enough, it's thin

The paper is great when it makes it through the printer. Not sure what happened to it but it looks like someone dropped it off a 10 story building.

I don't know what happened but the printer I got from here didn't except the paper

The box arrived soaking wet, but I figured it would be ok, since each pack of paper arrives tightly wrapped in plastic. But nope, all three packs were open for some bizarre reason, so the moisture got inside and wrinkled the paper.

you get what you pay for, stay away...no quality, like newspaper, Dollar store has better paper

Box only included 9 / 10 reams

ODD paper, very flimsy and sheets stick together and make printing a nightmare...what happened to this paper?

not real please with this paper it is very thin.

Could have sworn I read the reviews b4 buying. Apparently, not.  This is by far the worse printing paper I've owned.  As stated in one of the reviews, no way is it 20 #, and many of the sheets are bent or wrinkled.  I had purchased this paper a few months ago, but was using up the rest of a ream I had.  Boy-oh-boy, don't waste your money!  I will only use this paper for scratch, or grocery lists, but not in my printer!

I purchased the HP paper because i believed it would be better than the Amazon paper. That was a huge mistake! The HP paper was so thin I could not use it in my Cannon printer! It was marked 20 lb but it was more like 10 lb paper. I returned it!!!!!!and purchased good old Amason Basics paper. Great paper at a great price!

The product itself is fine, but the problem I have is with the plastic packaging. Is it really necessary to have plastic for this product? I understand the need to protect the product from spills, rain, warehouse leaks, and other liquid damage. What I consider to be a bigger problem is the absurd need for one-time-use plastics that only exacerbate the waste problem in this world. I can't, in good conscience, recommend this product until the manufacturer does one of two things: starts offering this product without any plastic wrapping, or voluntarily takes back and accounts for all plastic wrapping from their products.

PROS:1. Great if needing thick paper (see CONS).2. Smooth, bright, perfect for picture quality and performance.3. Easy to use.4. True to color and clean.5. Performance is good as long as you pay attention to the narrative.CONS:1. Not regular printer paper.2. If you have an HP printer, the value  for the money is cheaper to get paper and ink together as a package subscription.

Three sides of the team of paper was ripped open when I opened up the box. I bought this paper for an end of year project as I wanted higher quality paper than what the school uses.

For optimum copies—to share with clients, for example—this HP paper is too thin and just OK for brightness. If you just need it for your own personal DRAFT copies, it's OK. Or if you're trying to save weight in postage, maybe? Otherwise, I'd recommend at least 22 lb and a 96 brightness rating. For my purposes, I won't order this one again.

Updated review after more than one use. This paper is so thin that it tears easy in my printer’s process (none of my previously used papers have done this) - and it wrinkles all over from the printer’s rollers …it also had paper jams every few pages printed.  Whatever paper I used before this the last few years never had this issue. I had to go to FedEx office to print my resume because the paper was too embarrassing to hand over to a prospective employer.

It seemed like the paper was exposed to moisture. It was crinkly but it did not get jammed. The last paper I got was fine. The only reason I did not return it was because I use this in my printer for misc. things that are not to important. Also it is a hassle to go to the store to return.

Not a fan of how thin this paper is compared to the Amazon brand.  Right after printing (with HP ink) the paper is so thin you get wavy paper aka too thin for ink. Save yourself the money.

Not great quality, pages stick together, corner bent. Bought for my HP printer.

The cream of paper arrived opened and first fourth of the real all crumpled.  It gets stuck in my printer due to the crinkles.  So disappointing when I needed the paper for an important printing job. The paper jams and what didn’t jam, looks sloppy and messy from crinkles.

Packet was received opened and it seen that someone has already used its missing some paper.

I am still going to keep and use it because I need it and it’s just paper—but I do not like that the package was cut open.

I didn’t like that the paper had been opened.  I Cant tell if paper is missing or not .  Im not going to count it.

The paper is great the problem is, seller say next day delivery.3 days later I went to the store to buy...PAPER!

Soooo I order the three pack trying to be on top of things and the first pack I opened the top upper corner was bent . When I went through that whole pack of paper every single paper was ruffled . So of course printing on it my papers came out like that and it’s highly annoying . I went into the second pack of paper and samething . So I may have a defective box but I threw it all out and will buy single packs of straight paper.

nothing wrong with the product,but it arrived damaged and no protection in the box to protect it,package was tore  and some paper was damaged.

I have so many paper jams with this HP paper. I have a hp printer so this is the second time I have tried it. The hammer paper has not one time got jammed. I can't wait to run out of paper. Most of it ends up being cut up for notes.

What’s to dislike about a ream of paper.

Today there are better options for our health than paper that smells like chemicals.  Think of the kids before using paper that is toxic

Too thin

Package was already open. Hopefully all the paper is there.

The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the paper is okay copy paper, as I have purchased this brand and type in the past from a local store in person.  It is thin, but gets the job done for my purposes, which is using at home for kids' homework, copies, etc.  However, the packaged arrived completely destroyed, and ALL of the paper was warped, many pages were stuck together. It is basically useless, because I am not going to go through the entire ream, pulling pages apart that are stuck, and then I am not sure if it will even feed through my printer, so we are using this for scratch paper for my kids' homework.... Save yourself money and frustration and just buy your copy paper from a brick and mortar store, or another store that ships better. Very disappointed overall.

Very thin paper and a rough unfinished texture.  Claims to be 20 lb weight but it's closer to 18 lb.  If you plan to scribble notes or print out rough drafts not intended for distribution, it will do.  Barely.  But if you are planning to do any professional correspondence, you won't want to use this.  So I definitely won't be buying it again.

So thin and cheap

The shipping box was not damaged, but the stack of pages itself had the plastic covering ripped on both ends, almost completely ripped off the top, and a top section of the paper stack was damaged. The shipping box was disproportionately large so I don't know if that could have somehow happened in shipping with all of the moving around. The paper itself looks kinda weird. I need it mostly for school work and printouts at home, so it might be fun, but it doesn't look like processional paper.

This paper is horrible. I had a few sheets of paper that was leftover from the last time I bought paper and when I received this paper I should have just left it in the box and sent it back, I'm still considering that option. It is a much darker color than my other paper and not as thick. But the worse part for me is that my HP printer is burning this paper and it never did that to the other paper I used and this is HP paper! Go figure, I think this paper is just to cheap for me and my printer so I'm going to have to send it back.

I didn't pay attention to the number of sheets because I assumed a ream is 500 sheets.  When I received my box I noticed the individual packages were so much thinner than what I was accustomed to as a ream of paper. Instead of the usual 500 this is only 400 sheets per package.  I thought there was a mistake so I reviewed my order again and only then noticed the description of 2400 Sheets/6 ream case.  If I didn't have a $5.00 coupon for this order I would have been very upset because it would have cost more price per sheet in comparison than buying some other brand with a true 500 sheets per ream. However, I still felt tricked by the company. HP should not use the term "ream" in their advertising. They should use "package" instead since their sheet quantity does not qualify as a ream.

HP paper is good - the delivery of this wasn't.  The box had busted open in several places and had been taped back up.  Of the 4 packages inside of the box, only one was ripped open also.  The order was also several days late.  The box looked like it'd gone through some incident with it.

This paper feels extremely cheap and thin.  I am not sure what happened because HP is a reputable brand.I would order elsewhere next time.

I'm pleased with everything about this particular variety of printer paper, except that my HP Deskjet Printer is unable to turn out a single page at a time. Instead, for each page printed, 3 pages come out for each single page of print I have never had this problem before with this 3 or 4 year old HP Printer. Printer paper that can't turn out one printed page after another is pretty much useless. Am now going through and separating each page, one by one, before inserting in printer's paper holder. Maybe that will help. Cannot recommend.

Outer wrapping was opened when received. Otherwise is okay.

the actual paper is just fine...it's the fricken wrapping around each ream.  1.  its super slippery to the point that it deflects scissors and each other when you stack. static?  2.  it's incredibly durable....yes durable...typically a positive right?  i seriously groan when i run out of paper because i know i am in for a poke and tug fest to get this .... package open.  it's crazy.  i am going back to the cheap, wrapped in paper, ... paper so i can stop with losing sleep over this packaging.  i mean i'm not dropping it on Mars with hopes it can now do some science and talk with earth....it's paper.  paper.

I ordered 10 reams of 500 sheets each. They sent one package of 750 sheets.That's ok. We got it worked out. Accidents happen.The problem is that the paper is very thin. Definitely not 20lb paper.

This paper is very decent quality for everyday use.However, every other time it's delivered, it arrives damaged.It comes wrapped in plastic on top of paper wrap. Both are damaged. Sometimes you get lucky, on others you don't.Not worth the hassle.

Paper is so heavy that it's not a good thing to buy online. I would advise buying it in a store instead. Our package arrived dirty, damaged, and the paper inside got dirty as well. The box was covered in packaging tape, but it wasn't enough. The corners had been worn away, leaving the paper exposed. Not only that, but the package happened to arrive in the rain and was too heavy for me to carry inside on my own, so I was unable to get it out of the rain right away.

Jammed frequently.

the plastic wrapper had split and enough water had gotten in to glue about a third of the pages together on one endthrew a quarter away and riffled through the rest to separate themthe edge is still wavy on that end...  i placed that edge facing away from the printer  hope that works

This paper is NOT 20gsm.  I don't know why it's sold as that, but you can actually see through to the sheet underneath.  This is not the paper that I wanted to use for clients.  This is just office stuff paper or give to the kids to draw on paper.  Don't waste your money.

This paper is grinding often unsuccesfully thru my printer.  leaving distorted pages and chunks of ground up paper in side the printer!!!  can you help?

The order arrived several days sooner than expected, however a few of the reams of paper were already ripped open, and the edges were dirty and there was something oily all over the packages!! There was an unprinted visa debit card was in the box as well which was also oily and all scratched up!

Was wondering why there was only one package of copy papers when it was supposed to be two cases of the hp copy papers? Where are the other nine packages? There are usually ten packages in one case, but the first box came as one package in a small box.

Instantly started having problems with ink and printing. Feels to thin.

Paper is purchased in reams of 500 sheets each.  400 is not a ream.  To call it a ream is to establish the ream quantity.  It is not.  They reduced it to 400 sheets.  Not a ream.Google Definitions: ream500 (formerly 480) sheets of paper.a large quantity of something, typically paper or writing on paper.

For some reason this paper is thinner than what I was expecting. I know it says it’s 20 pound paper but it’s thin and jams up my printer

This paper is not the best quality. It has a slight sheen to it and is a bit thinner than my preferred Office Depot brand. The price was also about what I would pay for Office Depot paper. Not a good deal for quality or price.

Cannot use, too thin

ORDERDED 1 2 PACK ID PAPER AND FIND OUT I'M STUCK FOR FUTURE DELIVERIES THAT I DO NOT NEED OR WANT. WISH THEY WOULD FIX THIS AS I CANNOT FIND THE PROCEDURE TO DO IT.PLEASE STOP ORDER

This paper is very thin. I normally print two sided documents. The paper is translucent so that it is difficult to read because the printing from the other side is visible. I won’t buy it again.

I ordered 10 cases of paper - which was to have 10 reams of 500 sheets.  However, when I opened to store onto our shelves, we only received "8 REAMS" of paper.  Could not find a number to call and advise of the discrepancy --- so, I will put it on here for all to see.

The paper is fine except for the creased pages throughout every ream.  I have to go through the paper and pull out creased pages before I put them in the printer.

It's paper what could possibly be wrong with paper? It’s so weird, but it curls up on the ends when I put it in my HP printer, resulting in frequent paper jams and frustration. It’s amazing to me because you’d think the weight of it would totally flatten it, but no. I won’t purchase again. Going back to the brand I get from Walmart.

It’s paper for my printer…. Seems fine

We bought this paper thinking there is something special about it being hp brand and all, and nope its just regular paper. But its good quality paper. Price is too high for one pack. Can buy similar pack for less than $5.5 star for quality3 star for price

So this is fine. paper in and of itself.I'm disappointed with the coating and the transparency.I researched this coating indicated by that icon and in most cases it is used even on thinner paper for duplex printing so that you can't see through it.  When it arrived I thought oh gosh it's telling me that I should buy a heavier paper weight for duplex printing but I wasn't sure and my goal was actually to have thinner paper that was not translucent.The photo is of draft amount of ink on this paper, one-sided printing only.Even though my plan was for duplex printing, I was planning on marking it up with markers and they go right through.  I'm not sure if permanent marker will go through the other versions. I think highlighter is supposed to not go through for sure.The green is the permanent marker. the pink is the highlighter.

Not only does this paper jam a lot but it always bins at the corners which smears the ink where the bend in the corner is. I don’t know why this is a consistent problem with this paper but other paper I’ve not had problems with. I guess no two papers are alike to include performance and paper jams. It’s over priced and under delivers.

Not really a quality paper for thickness or texture. Jams often.

Arrived on time.  Quality of the paper is good and as described.  But shipping damaged one corner of one of the 2 reams of paper since it was delivered in a box without additional package filler, it banged around in shipping.  It's OK when you feed the paper with the wrinkled corner away from the feeder. It jams the printer if you try to print double sided and the printer flips the paper over and tries to feed with the wrinkled corner in. I would not buy via Amazon again.  Will buy from a local office supplier.

Bought 3 reams of paper, probably never live long enough to use it all!

Although this is an excellent product, it is cheaper to buy at Costco and you actually get more paper.

OK

Paper is OK. It is thin compared to other brands I thought with it being HP brand it would be a better quality than it actually is.

The paper quality was about what I expected and arrived in a very well constructed box that protected the ream from harm during shipping. But one corner of the ream had been bashed before shipping so that a corner of each of the 500 sheets is slightly crumpled.

I had been ordering another brand and duh...did not realize I would care if I didn't have 24 weight and 97 bright. This HP paper is actually just fine for my needs, as it is not needed for a business, but I guess the other paper from another company made me a snob. I wouldn't have to have it brighter than 92 but I definitely don't want a 20 lb weight anymore. Definitely if I had a business I'd order a 24/97 paper.

Ordering paper online is not recommended it came bent in the corners, see picture

Seems to get stuck in my printer.  I usually order their higher quality product.  This one felt short.  Don't recommend.

This paper is thinner than others.

Amazon paper is more quality and pure white than HP. I don't like HP. Taught HP will be better due to brand name but that's incorrect.

The A4 printing paper is very thin, and it feels like it will break easily with just a gentle pull. The quality is not very good

It's paper, but not as heavy as I thought it would be - it's somewhat see-through.  Prints fine.

Problem is that many of the sheets had a permanent crease (fold) in them. Don't know if that came from shipping or the manufacturer, but it is a bit of a downside having a huge fold on the side of every  other sheet.

Paper is thinner than usual HP Paper.

Very thin and printing on these are a waste of ink. This paper is best for kids to draw on or other basic use that does not require printing. I will not buy again.

It's more of a copier paper.  Paper is too thin for printing  letters.  It's good for recipes, and non important items.  Color is not white, a little off in color.  Not happy, but I'll buy a better quality next time.

I purchased this paper for printing order invoices for customer orders from a Canon inkjet.  It is quite thin and doesn't imply quality and reliability to my brand, making it look cheap.  The texture is smooth but has an uneven look to it. I wouldn't buy it again.

This paper is very thin.  I definitely won’t buy again as I prefer thicker printer paper that I can’t easily see through.

Average quality compared to other brands and WAY overpriced for grade od paper.

The paper is very thin. Expected a better quality paper.

Price should be lower

I received my ream of HP Paper and it was open on 2 sides. It was not sealed.  I am very disappointed.  Most of the paper was fine.  Opened on the left side and bottom.

I bought 10 reams of this for our laser printer.  I have used it before, but this batch is not the same quality as the paper I had last spring. It is supposed to be 20 pound, but it is thinner.  If I have two pages, I can see the 2nd page through the first one and that shouldn't be that way.  Either the reams I have are either mislabled or defective or someone was sleeping at the factory.  We print student work and even a flair pen bleeds through.  I may have to go with a different supplier and brand.HP was good.

Good enough.

I placed an order for HP printer paper on February 24.  Generally good paper and good service.  I specified Two-Day Shipping.  I recieved the delivery on MARCH 9.  If I am reading my calendar correctly, that's 13 days.  It toke so long that I ordered again.  Now I have an extra ream of paper.  Well.  I'll use it eventually.

Dropping 2 stars from an otherwise okay paper, why? for the simple reason they have dropped the page count from 500 to 400 sheets per ream. Reams of paper have been 500 sheets as long as I remember and I'm 60 years old. Well someone executive decided "let's drop 100 sheets off and up the profits". When does this madness stop!? Prices go up quantity gos down. So that's an even larger price increase in my book. It seems that's the world we live in now. Wonder what changed that this is now the new norm?.....hmmm

We have far too much plastic is the world, creating microscopic plastic throughout the planet and everything that lives on it. Wrapping printer paper in plastic is unconscionable. I keep trying to find paper on Amazon that is not wrapped in plastic. I may need to go to the store in person to be sure I get paper that is wrapped in paper. Come on, HP, get with it ... this is not a good thing you are doing. Stop the selfishness and put something besides CEO compensation and corporate profits out in front, while we still have a livable planet.

not much to say, it's paper

I love this product, use it consistently, however, the price has gone up Exponentially.  PLEASE DO NOT SHIP UPSP!  the product is sitting in my mailbox locker since Monday delivery, because I can't lift and move it to my apartment.  it's always been delivered to my door where I can push it inside and unpack it.

Not that much brighter pages

Good I guess  but tad expensive considering its paper.It does the job.

Got this paper recommended by HP- super thin- I expected better quality.

Working at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We needed printer paper.  So, I scoured Amazon for the best possible price, and settled on this.  I bought a case.  It was delivered by US mail, believe it or not.The paper is white enough, and it seems to work fine in our color laser printer.  But it feels quite a bit rougher than the paper I'm used to using (whatever we get in the office) and it's also not nearly as opaque as I'd like (I print a lot of two-sided output, and I can absolutely see the ghost of the other side while reading the first side).Now I've got a case of it... for better or for worse.  But I definitely will NOT be buying more.Not recommended, unless you really want THE least expensive option and you're willing to trade-off texture and opacity.

The ways that companies find a way to sneakily raise their prices continue to amaze me.  This paper is advertised as 2400 sheets/6 reams.  I believe a ream of paper is now and has always been 500 sheets.  Didn't notice the discrepancy until I opened the box and started removing the packages of paper. The first one seemed a little light and surprise...so were the rest of them.  I wouldn't mind so much if they were up-front about it but this hit and run just seems a little sleazy to me.  The quality of the paper is fine and it works well in my HP all-in-one printer which is synced with my HP computer (notice a trend?) but the point is...I feel just a little betrayed.  Anyway, you signed up for a review, not a diatribe on the latest shabby retail tactics.  Good product...bad marketing.  I will continue to buy copy/print paper from Amazon, probably not HP, for only the above reason.

came as described. use able

Papers are thin. Not really like it but couldn't return because I already opened it

The pack that I received were actually cut about 1/32nd of an inch wider than the specified 8 and 1/2 inch.  Maybe this will not be an issue in most printers, but with the sliders all the way spread on my printer tray, the stack fit too tightly and most often would not pull into the printer.  My only solution was to use my paper cutter and carefully cut the extra 1/32nd inch off the longer dimension.  It's a time-consuming process, but I did have the satisfaction of figuring out how to make the paper work for me.  My printer, by the way, is a Canon MF229dw.

Be aware that there are only 400 sheets per ream when you purchase this product.  A standard ream is 500 sheets.  So this 6-pack product only has 2,400 sheets of paper, not the 3,000 that I expected.

This is true HP paper, which is what I wanted for my HP printer. While loading it into my printer, I noticed it felt thinner then my usual 20# bond. I also noticed the printer sometimes picks up multiple sheets at the same time. The newest paper I purchased were 750 page reams as opposed to 500 page reams. Since I bought two of these reams, I guess I just have to hope for the best.

Bought 2 reams. One ream had bottom of wrapping completely torn away to expose paper. Was shipped in box so it was not delivery person's fault.

It’s ok for daily black and white printing when it comes to copies etc but for my purposes (sewing pattern printing) it is flimsy and does not absorb colored ink as well as standard paper. I wanted to do my part for the environment but it just tears so it won’t work for my needs.

This is very thin paper.  I’m not sure how they determine the 20lb. designation but it seems less.  It is definitely not good for two sided printing jobs. You can see the print from both sides.I have an Epson printer and it feeds/prints fine with the paper.  It’s good for low quality printing needs.  I would not recommend for sending printed material to external sources on this paper.

This paper is very thin and will fold and warp if you print something too inky. This paper is good for black & white text only in my opinion. If you print any color or photos, I don't recommend this specific type of paper.Working fine for me, i am using them for printing.you may find them little thin if you are doing both side printing.they are good for copying.

Good product.

I use HP 20 lb. copy paper for my HP printer. This paper is for projects I work on and it rarely curls or jams. The color of white is correct, not too glaring. It should have been sent separately from the other items I ordered; this was my error, as I could have requested separate shipping. I would suggest that for future orders. Also, for some of my projects, I would rather have 22 lb test, but that is not easily obtainable in white. The ream is 500 pages, large enough for most of my projects.

Been a long time since I ran out of computer paper. I believe in recycling the back of mostly all except what is important. So, when I saw this the price and speed with which Prime sent it and it arrived made this a perfect purchase.

Good for printing materials and reasonable prize.

Works as good as more expensive papers.

Works well with my HP printer.

Good quality for the price

Perfect

ok

exactly as described.  worked well.  good value.

It’s regular printer paper. Bright white, Easy to use, Very light, Strong, and doesn’t jam. My only problem is that I received an open pack of printer paper because of the way that the plastic was wrapped over it so the last paper is the only dirty one.

It’s paper. It’s plain old paper. Yes it works in your copier. Yes it’s reasonably priced. Just by it already it’s paper.Good luck!

Thickness is good.

This paper seems to be a heavier quality paper than most, but prints just fine.

Hey what can I say about this product.  20# printer paper is 20# printer oaper. Can’t get excited about this other than I couldn’t believe the price!  But then everything has gone up in price

The product was true to form and printed exactly how it should.

I am not sure 'the standard' on printer paper. I use it to print study guides for school, but also to write out notes and pictures for studying. The paper seemed pretty thin to me. Wish I would have ordered a thicker paper, however it will do the job!

Paper perfect for home printer. Smooth and not too heavy.

Gets the job done for my Hp printer.

The sheets are thick and durable.

It printed without any issues.

Thick paper but no issues

My only complaint really, is that it did not come in one day like the adv said, but only took two days so that was okay too, I guess.  I do have higher quality papers, but don't always need them for standard printing.

Great value !

Computer printer

It's paper

good

Yep... This HP paper is less expensive and there's more paper than the Amazon home essentials brand. This paper has a nice bright appearance and a decent weight and feel to it. Highly recommend. After using the essentials brand for about a year, there's a big noticable difference between the two. I found my new go to paper.

Works great in laser printer. No jams. Weight is lighter so if do a lot of printing, money saver.

I like this paper!  it is a great everyday paper for anything from letters to signs.  Good value for the price.  I would buy it again -- actually, I think this is the 2nd time I bought it.  But if you want something more average to do something like a ton of draft print outs or "throw away / mock-up" stuff, this might be too heavy and wast your ink.

The purchase of printer paper is hardly the most difficult decision I've made in a while. That said, this brand was reasonably priced and delivered on a decent schedule (though a day late as I recall). No paper jams so far and none expected.

This paper if perfect for my old eyes.  The brightness isn't overwhelming.  Words are printed clear.

Value of this is overall good although you can find cheaper elsewhere. The paper has a slight waxy feeling to it but it gets the job done well

Prefect

Good quality copier paper.Wish is was half the price

I formerly gave this HP Multipurpose paper a 5-star recommendation. My life is full of (self-created) clutter, requiring numerous car trips for small objects--from ballpoints to markers to Scotch tape to frozen waffles to paper--lots of it, for the bathroom, office, and music studio. I wouldn't recommend this HP paper for the first of the aforementioned applications, but it serves me well in the other two areas. As copy paper, it moves through my printer without a hitch, readily absorbing ink and producing a sharp and clear final draft. As music manuscript paper, it's got enough fiber to stand up on its own on a piano ledge or music stand (many are the times that an overly thin sheet simply wilts and folds in half with no help from me). Last, the packet is a full 500 sheets (some of the store brand "value packs" show an attractive price--until the small print reveals a total of 400 sheets).Until a couple of days ago, ordering this essential product from Amazon was a no-brainer, making it not only convenient but more economical to have the paper delivered right to my front door. But, perhaps not surprisingly, the price has more than doubled and the good feelings accordingly down a peg. Still, given the distance of my closest supplier and my tendency to motor out for a single item at a time, ordering the paper (but far less often) at its current price isn't out of the question.Another, at least partial, solution would be to reduce the clutter with the cooperation of manufacturers and suppliers. The makers of so many of the appliances, media devices, technological toys and gadgets (including software programs) could contribute considerably toward a more manageable environment by returning to that rapidly vanishing artifact--the printed manual, or instruction booklet. From the iPad to the Kindle (with its 200-page online manual) to every downloaded MP3 music file, the assumption is--I'm not exactly sure--perhaps that we'll save the information to our computer desktops or that we'll happily print it out or that we'll read the online instructions and remember them later or that an instruction booklet would be sufficiently intimidating to prevent us from using the device or that even the most venerable among us will somehow catch up with a younger generation that can be incredibly intuitive about many of these devices and highly impatient with (if not altogether indifferent toward) printed instructions.

I like this brand

Works as expected.

I really liked this paper, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it but because of my budget I was able to find it somewhere else a couple of dollars cheaper.  If I could afford it thought I would keep getting it because I like the delivery part.

It's paper what else is there to say?

Quality is OK but the price is too high

Good

It's the regular weight for copier paper. It's a nice bright white. It's a good price.

Fair quality

I don’t print a lot but this works great in my laser printer. I have not had any jammed pages.

Very good quality copy paper

Quality has been pretty good. A few corners smashed in the packaging. Better than my previous order for Hammermill.

Print out knitting, crochet and multi media patterns

HP Copy & Print paper offers a perfect balance of quality and performance. It's substantial enough to feel professional yet light-sufficient for smooth, jam-free printing. The paper's brightness enhances print quality, delivering vivid colors and sharp text. It's an eco-friendly choice, sourced from renewable resources with 0% deforestation. It performs well on HP and other printers, with ColorLok technology ensuring faster drying and bold, vibrant results. While some users have mixed feelings about the thickness, it provides excellent value for money and reliable performance for high-volume printing at home, school, or the office.

What's not to like about H-P paper? Nice 20# sheets. Works fine with our inkjet printer. Can print both sides. Feeds without a hitch. Price cheaper than big box or warehouse stores in our area. Happy purchase.

I have used two reams of the five and I've had no issues.  I fan the paper edges before putting it into the paper tray and I have not had any issues with jamming.  It's just typical copy paper that does the job.  I like the 5 ream case because I must carry the paper upstairs and it's easier for me to lift than a 10 ream case.  Price-wise it's still fairly economical, so I'm happy.

This is really great quality paper at a great price. So glad I ordered it and I’ll be ordering more in the future!

Excellent quality paper at a great price. No problems with jamming in my printer.

I have a home office and this is great quality and a great price. The paper is smooth but also thick. I’ve printed color and the transfer is great.

I order this all the time.  I love the convenience of the quick delivery and quality of paper.

HP Paper mid-heavy paper weight that works good in HP Printers and there are very little to no paper jams. There are 5 packages of paper in each case which is very convenient. Each packet of paper is individually wrapped and the size of box is easy to move about and carry. Item is reasonably priced . Highly recommended.

I always go back to HP paper. Once I bought a ream of recycled paper for my copier, thinking I was doing something good for the environment. The environment may have been helped, but these pages from the recycle pack had a rough texture almost like a newspaper. Every sheet of this Recycled, photocopy paper kept getting stuck in my printer. Which made me have to go back to traditional photocopy paper like this brand. Now I will never leave this brand and I won’t let the word Environmental sway me because it’s not a good fit for my printer.

I love this paper Amazon sells it at a reasonable priceThis is great paper it doesn’t jam up in my copier it has a great feel to it

Seems like standard paper.  The printer prints fine to it.  No jams.

Nice white color.  Did not get stuck in my printer, which is not an HP incidently.  Nice weight paper.  Buying it again right now!  Great pricing too!

Works great in my HP  printer.  Nice quality paper.

I bought this as a cheaper alternative for kids marker/crayon/pencil paper art. Now they have a huge stack of paper and get to color until bedtime!

A good paper for everyday home use.

Printing instructions for patterns and recipes

The printer paper is excellent

Exactly as described, fast shipping,

Paper appearance is standard white. Overall good thickness and durability, no problem jamming. Ink sticks well, seems to be correct size.

Nice paper and works well with my printer.

I print my own shipping labels for my business this paper is great for the price and I’ve never had a paper jam with it.

Haven't used this yet, but it looks fine - I'm sure it will be great!

Just the ability to have my HP paper delivered to the door so I don't have to carry that big box to the car and then from the car to the house, is priceless. Always dependable  paper for printing my sales literature.

This paper is great quality - it’s not super thin like some others. I’d say it’s the perfect thickness. I haven’t had any paper jam yet and it seems to be compatible with any printer. It’s not glossy and works well.

Good product.  Inexpensive

Better than the Amazon paper at a cheaper price.

Arrived as promised 👻

Arrives in great condition

Good price great quality

It is cheaper than the big box stores

Good price. Stocked up.

Haven't found a better paper and they cost more.  This is a no brainer.  Reasonably priced and works well.

Would buy again.

at home printings

Nice quality paper.

It's card paper

This is a good printer paper. High quality and thick with no bleed.

Great quality for price

It's paper.... Nice

I needed printer paper and got it quick and easy right here on Amazon. Very pleased with my purchase.

Love the price

Works well with my printer. Clear words and prints out pictures clearly too.

Good quality paper

Great quality product.

OMG, its paper.  What should i do with this ?.  I could print stuff from the computer or draw on it.  Look its just plain paper.  There is nothing else special about this :D

Nice paper

EVERYTHING OK

If you get a faulty product and can't resolve the issue by making a return, you will be forwarded to Kimberly-Clark customer support. Instead of replacing the product or issuing a refund, they send you “some coupons through the mail,” which barely cover the cost of the product you had to file the claim for and that you can't use on Amazon or anywhere I usually shop. I won't be purchasing again.

Since March, of this year, 2013, this product has been $15.90, with subscribe and save, and free shipping with Prime.Now, for the month of June 2013, the price for me has increased to $18.72, a $2.82 increase from the same $15.90 from the month of May 2013.Most would not consider this a big deal as having items shipped to your door, 2nd day with Prime, is nice but that is almost 3 bucks. The local Dollar Store has these for $16 but you must pay tax, physically go to the store, etc.This is not all. I sincerely wish I had some of the towels left from the May boxes because they are now shipping redesigned towels and boxes. Yes, if you still have a box from May, compare it to your June box.The June box is smaller, which is nice because it takes up slightly less space on the towel rod but I also noticed something else... This is where I cannot truly verify my own feelings. An anecdote, if you will... The towels from the new box feel "lighter" and a tad bit smaller. This falls to the chicken/egg idea... Folks, I noticed there was a difference in towel absorbency and "feeling" BEFORE I checked the boxes.While the boxes claim the same dimensions on the towels, there is nothing to denote a specific "weight" to the towels that would indicate strength or surface area to roughly equate to the ability to absorb moisture.I feel as if the trend with these Kleenex Hand Towels are going the way of many of the toliet papers that are being sold here on Amazon. The companies will build up very high regard, and this reviews, for a product and then make slight price increases and lessen the material [read smaller boxes=smaller towel density] and thus increase profit with virtually no one taking notice. I want to call this a halo product but it is more of a "bait and switch" and "supply/demand/price increase" thing.I loved the old towels, as of May 2013, but now I am considering a cancellation of my subscribe and save. Almost a 3 dollar price increase and I am getting less to dry my large American hands... No thanks.

For many years, a lot of Kimberly-Clark brands have been my family's trusted go-to product. In fact, I used to get these delivered at my door step each month on a subscribe and save plan.  However, after calling customer service and waiting and waiting for a change, I will no longer be using this product or maybe purchasing anymore brands from Kimberly-Clark.  The reason being along with the one star is the hand towels no longer hold the quality like they use to. This product is now no different than a sheet of thick toilet paper or thick kleenex.  I get more out of my wallet using paper towels at this rate than purchasing this junk every month.  So, if you like throwing away your money to paper that doesn't dry your hands, by all means be my guest and go ahead. . . Otherwise, I recommend using paper towels instead if your need is disposable hand towels or just buying a bunch of wash cloths in bulk to hand dry once.  And for anyone at Kimberly-Clark reading this . . . if you want to see better reviews and a change of stars, then please change your product.  Customer after customer have complained about your hand towels and yet there has been no change.  Either improve your product or discontinue it all together. . . Once you do, I'll be more than willing to redo this review and hopefully you get a happy returning customer.

I have been buying these disposable hand towels for years and used to absolutely love them.  I gave some to my ophthalmologist and told him how handy they were for people like me who have to use eye drops several times a day and have to keep our hands and around our eyes clean and sterile.  I recommended that he tell his patients about them.  I have also given them to family members and bragged about how great they are.  But now I am greatly disappointed because they are not as sturdy, fall apart when you wet them, and they stick together when you try to pull one out from the dispenser.  I subscribed on Amazon for delivery of six boxes every three months, but I am considering canceling the subscription.  Kleenex (Kimberly-Clark) needs to pay attention to all the negative reviews regarding the significantly reduced quality of this product and go back to making these hand towels like they used to.

This product (not seller) turned out to be a disappointment to me. I recently had the opportunity to use a Kleenex Hand Towel to dry my hands at a local restaurant and was so impressed with their disposable towels I took the cover off their towel holder to see what brand they were. I have large hands and often must use 2 or 3 towels to dry. I was easily able to use one towel in this restaurant and also found them very durable. So much so that I pulled my phone out and immediately ordered what I thought was the same towel (same brand/name). What I discovered with the arrival of these towels is that they are smaller and less durable. In fact, a paper towel off the roll is better. So there must be a commercial version or something that eluded me. If you are looking for a smaller disposable towel, perhaps this is right for you but they are worthless to me.

These were my FAVORITE!!! I got so tired of expensive hand towels being ruined on the regular so I switched to these and only have what I call "deco towels" in all the bathrooms and by the busy sinks and most used areas. BUT THESE NEW BOXES, THE COLORS AND HIDEOUS DESIGNS, there's absolutely no way I'm going to put them all over my house!!! I am really annoyed!!!! So ugly!!!!

I have ordered these twice.  Each time, I received 5 boxes as pictured; off-white/gray and dark gray.....PLUS, the 6th box was, OH GOOD GRIEF, you have got to be kidding!  The box is a mixture of back/white checkers;  then yellow background with hot pink roses, deep blue color on the sides,& the back is completely hot pink background with hot pink roses!  To add insult to this, ( I am assuming) that the seller SIGNED THE BOXES WITH HER NAME AND PUT XOX NEXT TO HER NAME!  What?  Why didn't the description/picture as advertised note that ONE box was going to be WEIRD and with someone's name and xoxox on it?  I would NOT have ordered.  I do NOT want some weird printed box of hand cloths in my guest bathrooms.. You can find the Kleenex Hand Towels at Stater Brothers grocery stores.  Plus, you won't waste $$$ on someone's idea of 'cute' ....I will not order from this seller again.

Don't understand why you needed to change the design without putting out a new SKU. These new designs are just ugly and don't go with any home decor. Would much rather have the option to keep buying the ones we had, or have at least plain looking boxes available (or a cover.) Cancelled my Subscription for another product, since I would never want to show these to guests in my home.

I usually am very satisfied with my purchases of Kleenex  Expression Hand Towels.  The boxes are very neutral and nice colors to place in your bathrooms. The boxes are pretty golds, greens, taupe etc.The Kleenex boxes delivered today contained 6 boxes of the most hideous colors that you could ever imagined.These boxes resemble very cheap gift wrapping paper from the clearance section. Very dull will never buy again.

I purchased a 6 pack of kleenex hand towels but only received 4 shrinked wrapped in a box.

These BRIGHT UGLY BOXES are not it!  THEY DON’T MATCH ANYTHING!  Please go back to the neutral colors boxes, something that actually matches my decor or at least give us the option to choose which color boxes we want.  I love these towels and my guests do as well but these colors are an eyesore in my bathrooms.

1 box empty other than the one that was sticking out of the end when I opened the box. See photos. Box isnt opened nowhere. I have been ordering these several times a month for so long now

Hand towels are a good product. Not sure why Kleenex decided to put inside such horribly designed boxes.

I have seen a commercial on television recently which I agree with when it states, "Your hands are only as clean as the towel you dry them on."  These are packaged to allow them to sit upside down on a towel bar or right side up on a counter.  They are absorbent and work very well.Update:  I ordered these several times and was very pleased with their quality and gave them 5 stars.  The product changed.  They now rip very easily and are not nearly as absorbent as they had been in the past.  They are so thin that to get them started out of the box, several rip.  I will no longer order this product and will find something else that is equal to the product before they made the change.

I love Kleenex hand towels, but when my shipment arrived, the hand towel boxes weren't like the photo, the boxes were covered with designs by Betsi Johnson. These towels were supposed to be for my two sons to take to their dorms, but the last thing my boys wanted was a hand towel box decorated with bright pink roses in the shape of hearts. And the design isn't my taste either, so I emptied out an old box and filled it with the new towels and threw the bizarre box away.  And I cancelled the auto ordering for this product. Don't want to buy more until this lame design is phased out. So I want to Target to some, and guess what--a shelf full of the Betsi Johnson designed boxes on clearance and no normal boxes.  I asked an associate said the new design didn't sell. Duh!

Kleenex needs to return the original box pattern of this product. Not  everyone wants in their bathroom decor of cherries, etc. not attractive. The old  pattern was more neutral and classic. It matched a larger number of bathrooms decor.  Please consider, thank you!

I do NOT like the new fruity colors on the Kleenex hand towel boxes. I will NOT buy these boxes until they return to their original designs.I will NOT buy the fruity colored hand towel boxes. Please return to the original design!

There were little bugs that looked like little spiders creeper me out the box was sealed so I don't know if a bug layer eggs in there or what but creepy

These hand towels were a 5 star item, thick and clean and effective. This "new and improved" barely 1 star version is literally unsanitary looking with big patchy holes in it and the towels are a fraction of the size. Immediate return.

I loved the Kleenex hand towels and I enjoyed getting them delivered but the colors of the new boxes didn’t fit my ecstatic and I wasn’t offered another choice so I have to say goodbye.

I ordered these hand towels previously through subscribe & save. They were packaged in grays, golds, & silver colors that matched my bathroom decor.  These hand towels are packaged in florals & fruits.  Will cancel my subscribe & save if this happens again.

I like the product that was presented, but received the wipes in boxes that didn't fit on your towel holder. I have purchased the product many times and they were so handy; the "boxes" of these towels I just received couldn't be placed anywhere in the bathroom like the other boxes that were what I had used. Those had the ability to be placed on the towel rack, the boxes had a different shape which was especially nice for guests.

I've subscribed to these for years. This was the first order containing boxes with such bold patterns. All previous orders were more neutral. Do not like these at all.

I am a year behind because I had ordered these towels in a greater frequency and quantity than I should have done.  The customers who complained that the Kleenex hand towels delivered after May 2013  are smaller, softer/thinner than the ones delivered only a few months before (May 2013 or earlier) are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. These are smaller and disintegrate when wet. And what a shame that the manufacturer insists there is no change in either size of each towel or its strength. I have boxes of each... The dimensions given on both on the outside of the box clearly document the size change. The quality decrement is immediately noticeable. Why would K-C deny it!!??i am going to cancel my subscription.

I love these for the bathroom.  But the new packaging is terrible.  Does not match any decor.  Please bring back the old packaging.  Who wants Cherry’s or all the other ugly packages.

Previous ones had beautiful neutral colors and patterns. They now come in ugly bright patterns. Immediately unsubscribed on Amazon

Have been buying this product for I don’t know how long. Have NEVER received these ugly boxes. Will use in our bathroom and try to save my pleasant boxes for guest bathrooms. Cancelled my subscribe and save for that reason.

I have been getting these for years but cancelled my subscription because I dont like the new hideous prints. The old print was subtle enough to leave out! Please bring back the old prints!

I read a lot of reviews before ordering these. There are a lot of 5 star reviews and quite a few 1-2 star reviews. These would probably work fine if you want to turn the box upside down on a towel rack and pull them out like you would paper towels in a public bathroom. I ordered these as guest towels for our powder room, and bought a separate metal display tray. They aren't separate towels; instead they are flimsy tissue/towels that pull out like tissues from a tissue box and are very cheap looking and feeling.

Overall I love the product and have been using them for years.  Because I was no longer able to find them in my local stores, I ordered from Amazon.  I'm not sure if I would order from Amazon again.  Two of the boxes were all squished and I'm not sure if they are going to stand up.  They don't look very nice in the bathroom for use as a replacement to hand towels.

The photo advertised is NOT what you get. The new "Betsey" design is gaudy and distasteful! How can bright yellow, blue, pink and black go with any bathroom decor? I will continue to buy these because I love the convenience of the towels, but can only give it 1 star because of the hideous box design. Bring back the muted colors in your picture, please!

These were wonderful and I was on auto delivery. The last box I opened was different and I was very disappointed. They were thinner, less soft and absorbent and when you pull one out you now need two hands to prevent the others from following and sticking to the first. I really do not like the new version and if this is the way they continue to come, I will have to find a better quality replacement.

In receiving my order of 6 Kleenex hand towel boxes. I was down to my last box in the shipment box I observed the box was empty of hand towels inside. The box was sealed as if it had not been touched. Though no product inside.

I want the sixth box that I paid for, only 5 were shipped.

We've been getting these great hand towels every month since 2017. But due to the Covid effects on our business, we've been trying to cancel this subscription for three months. This product is not showing up on our subscriptions and only shows up as an order after delivery. I guess we're going to return them each month since we can't seem to stop them from shipping.

I dislike box colors shown that you do not receive and boxes crushed inside smaller box to save you money and you don't CARE.

I OPENED THE FIRST BOX, AND ALL THE PAPERTOWELS SMELLED LIKE VINEGAR!!  i COULD NOT RETURN.

I’ve been purchasing this product for several years. Unfortunately they’ve changed the box design to match absolutely nothing so I won’t purchase again.

I have purchased these towels from Walmart previously and box construction was perfect.  2 cases from Amazon were misshapen, with cardboard  edges sharp and lacerated my finger.  These must be "seconds" or the quality control fork were asleep.Towels are soft & absorbent.

Missing two boxes of tissues!

Some of the hand towel boxes came smashed.

The Kleenex box pictured is not how they are configured anymore. They are in rectangular boxes which does not allow them to go on a towel rack. Please update your pictures so people know. I am disappointed that they are not the right shape anymore.

I've been buying these for quite some time.They've changed their design and quality. The boxes are smaller, the towels are smaller and everytime I grab one from the box the entire WEAK towel rips in half.C'mon, that's ridiculous!

The description for this item is 6 boxes of paper towels.  The outside packaging also says 6 boxes of paper towels.  Inside the package were only 5 boxes.

Boxes came in undamaged. ...great***update*** i subscribe so I am just unboxing my hand towels and one box is missing towels. It is sealed with nothing inside. I have missed my window for return so i just leaving a bad review. Granted this is the first time it had happened, but you want what you pay for. Times of shortages people expect to at least get their items, so one star until I get a replacement.

Really liked the pattern so I ordered them… but not what I received!

These boxes are totally ugly geometric patterns, nothing like the ones I have purchased in more neutral colors and patterns! PLUS I have had to cut my own opening in the plastic to get them out! Are these seconds?!? Absolutely hate them, and will purchase in store from now on, where I can pick my own subtle, pretty neutral boxes!

Have used a few times.  I'm sure just a manufacturing error.  One of the boxes in the case was sealed up and empty inside.  We were shorted one of the boxes inside the case.  Already pricey for the convenience so missing the product in a box was disappointing.

On the strength of the many recommendations on Amazon, I bought this item but I was disappointed when I saw the actual size of them. They are no better than a piece of regular kitchen roll paper. I don't see how anyone could identify these as being a hand towel replacement. I use two to dry my hands and will not be buying any more of this item, I've just wasted my money.

All 6 boxes were dented

As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the product itself is great, but the packaging I received is not what is shown.  I love the new colorful new Kleenex packaging, but sadly received the drab, old style boxes.  Perhaps the seller is shipping old stock first and will eventually get to the new packaging.I realize the listing states "packaging may vary", but all of the pictures shown have the new packaging.  The seller really should add some pics of the old style boxes so customers are less likely to be disappointed.

I have these on subscribe and save and was very disappointed when the latest shipment arrived. These designs are way too bold and don’t fit in with any decor in the house. I will have to come up with a new solution for disposable hand towels until they right this wrong.

The towels are great!  I just wish I received the boxes as shown when I placed the order. Yes, it does say packaging varies, but the product picture shows bright and beautiful flowers. I received drab, shaded, ugly boxes.  I was looking forward to the cheerful boxes.  Maybe advertise the dull boxes so that buyers will be pleasantly surprised when they receive the colorful ones.  Kinda deceitful marketing!

If you’re looking to brighten up a small child’s bathroom, these are great. They’re not appropriate for a room that has specific decor. The pattern is a bit extreme.

I have purchased these on subscription for years- I am now contemplating canceling because the boxes are now cartoonish colors… I really don’t want to display these😪

So disappointed in these as they have a nasty smell to them, and it takes two to dry your hands.  I used one pack and donated the rest, total waste of money.

I decided to order these through Amazon since we use these instead of a shared towel to dry our hands in the winter especially during cold and flu season... they are a bit cheaper through Amazon than my local grocery store and we are going through these like water because we wash our hands A LOT!!HOWEVER, these seem to have a stinky vinegar smell to them that I did not notice when I bought the same Kleenex towels at the local Grocery store?! I'm NOT liking this AT ALL!!! Also, the towels seem to be smaller and thinner than before?! Has anyone else noticed this??!!I guess I may be on the search for a new disposable hand towel if this is going to be the new 'downgraded' version of Kleenex paper hand towels!!!! WHY do companies ALWAYS have to ruin a good thing??Also.... The 'Betsy Johnson' or whatever this hidious black and white checkered and fluorescent pink rose designed box is HAS GOT TO GO! YUCK!!! WHO wants THAT hidious looking thing in their powder room?!?! THANKFULLY I got lucky and only received one of this ugly looking box in this pack of 6! STILL, ONE is TOO MANY!!!!Doesn't really matter anyway because these towels take your nicely fresh Smelling clean hands and turn them into STINKY VINEGAR smell after drying them with these towels!!!!!KLEENEX, WHY?? I MEAN REALLY!!!!???

I have been purchasing these for a while and if you will look at the pictures - they have shortened the length of these and if this is the new norm for the same price I will not be ordering them anymore - disappointing!!!

It does what you'd expect.  Only negative is that the boxes are like half full.  I combined two boxes just to make it feel serviceable and not devoid of towels.  Would recommend for when you have guests over, but not daily use.

do not like the flowered boxes. do not go with the room.

Absolutely HATE the new colors.  They don't match anything in our bathroom and look like Girl Scout cookie boxes.  Please bring back neutral colors.

I purchased six boxes of these "hand towels."  I opened 2 of the boxes and placed one in the kitchen and the other in the bathroom.A lady friend and her daughter were over for pizza lunch and her daughter washed up in the bathroom and her mother in the kitchen. I was waiting my turn at the sink when her daughter yelled, "Mom, these towels stink!"My lady friend raised a couple of the towels to her nose and confirmed that they did, in fact, smell unpleasant. I pulled a few towels from the box and yikes, not a good smell at all. We opened two more boxes and they had the same odor. YUK!!What's possibly worse, is that the odor transfers to your hands. Not a stretch to say that the unpleasant odor would transfer from the towel to whatever body part it came into contact with.Maybe a production issue of some sort at the manufacturing facility is the culprit, I don't know. I doubt Amazon will care, but I wanted to let my fellow Amazon Primers know of my experience (and the two young ladies experience) with these rather stinky towels.I'm sending these towels back to Amazon and we'll go back to Brawny paper towels.

too few in a box to make these economical. i knew that when i bought them tho. Delightful, soft absorbent with gorgeous boxes

4 of the six boxes were smashed in pretty badly.

Thought i was going to get the cute boxes in the product pictures with the cherries but instead got the ones with the plain outdated pattern

Why did the package design/color change.  I really do NOT like the new packaging.

Two of the Kleenex boxes were missing see the attached photograph only forward inside the box. They were all banged up. Please resend the proper amount of Kleenex towels.

I used to buy locally, boxes of these kleenex disposable paper hand towels.  I recently ordered these on Amazon, and the box is of a  lower quality, but more significantly, this paper towel smells badly after being used to dry ones hands.  This was not the case several years ago.

I was a big fan of these hand towels and would always buy some at my local Safeway until they stopped stocking them. When I found them on Amazon, I jumped at ordering them in bulk. Amazon is terrific as usual.However, these towels are much smaller than before. I didn't notice it until my girlfriend said they were not the same. I ran out to the trash and retrieved the old box for comparison. Yep, much smaller.The box has the same measurements but a different barcode.Does this mean the "old" was oversize or does the new conform to specification? I hate the idea of being duped, but this is our brave new world.Yeah for Amazon! Boo for Kimberly-Clark

I order these towels all the time,with no issue  just opened them and they stink !  Like chemicals.  Strange!

I had these hand towels on Subscribe & Save for quite a few months and have been very happy until my delivery yesterday.  These hand towels used to be BIGGER and much THICKER.  I was amazed at the high quality.  NOW...they rip when I pull them out of the box - very thin and much smaller.Don't waste your money - wash your hand towels and save.  These aren't worth it!!!Kleenex-it doesn't pay to skimp.  Consumers NOTICE!!!

This product was far below my expectations.  I have purchased Kleenex towels before and loved them.  These are stiff, with poor absorbancy and pretty awful.  Value for the money---these have almost no value to me.  If not for some scarcity during Covid pandemic, I would have returned them or thrown them away.

These are just okay.  Adults may need two to dry their hands as one gets soaked pretty quickly.  Paper towel absorbency still has them beat.  I can use Bounty Select-a-Size and get more drying using one small sheet than I do with these.  I'm still buying them though, so there's that.  LOL

Used to be great, now the quality is poor.

I ordered 2 cases of these tissues.  They were put in a big shipping box.  When I opened the shipping box one case was perfectly fine but the other was crushed.  When I opened it up the beautiful tissue boxes inside didn’t look so beautiful and couldn’t even dispense right because of the damage.

Have been using these for several years have never had any problems until this order.  2 boxes were sealed but completely empty. And others did not appear to be full.

These towels are too small and too expensive for what you get. Honestly, my 3-year-old has to use two of them. If you're really lucky, a box will last 3 days. More than one kid or a teenager and forget it.I swear the 5-star votes are coming from Kimberly-Clark employees. It's job security if people are crazy enough to buy these.

I like the product, especially now, but how does this happen! Out of 12 boxes, one was totally empty of any towels. It's ok, not expecting any response, these are good towels, but how do you end up with a sealed empty box!

These are soft and fairly absorbent but they are very small. Only slightly larger than a facial tissue. They are just too small to be useful in drying your hands. Not wanting to pull out a second towel, I leave the sink with hands still damp.  I’ll use up what I purchased but will not reorder.

This package was delivered a box within a box. But the box that holds the wipes is a dispenser and it was damaged. Therefore I had to improvise.

We've purchased this item 5 times now and all was in order. Our February order however came with an individual box that was completely empty. Its still all sealed … just nothing inside!Still trying to figure out how to get it replaced.

Disappointed that instead of six boxes in the shape/design showed that I received 3 BIG rectangular boxes that do not fit where I usually place it :(

The packaging and product have changed and not for the better. The hand towels are smaller and thinner.  They tear easily when wet and you find yourself using two where one would do previously. Still, they are handy - no pun intended.

Oh my gosh, these people thought it was a good idea to send this in a giant box that said Kleenex.  I have to carry this to my dorm room and people gave me alot of bs bit it is a good product

I buy these on Amazon Subscribe and Save, and have always sworn by them, but am probably going to cancel. The manufacturer has changed the product drastically... the box, it's not displayable in a nice bathroom anymore. Plus the quality of the actual hand towels has changed...when you pull one out it rips in little pieces in your hand. And I know this sounds weird, but whatever new paper they are using, well it stinks. As in smells bad!  I am looking for another brand to come up with something as nice as the original Kleenex Hand Towels.

We get these because my husband is into them, as a semi-germaphobe. They are thick, and easy to dispense, and the packaging is very thick and sturdy.But I recommend NOT buying these.1) they're incredibly wasteful, as far as packaging. Worst of all you don't really get that many hand towels per individ. box.2) Because of the above, they're not a great value.3) Unless you have composting, you end up simply trashing a whole lot of thick paper product just in the hand towels.

Hello. I am a return customer but just noticed that one (out of 6) of my Kleenex boxes was empty.It is sealed but has no contents inside. Help?Will change review once a response is received.

Most of the towelettes had holes in them.  I buy these for my mother in law and she is worried they are bug holes!

I just opened one of the case of 6 boxes and 5 were just fine - but one box was sealed and had nothing inside.  Not too happy with this.  So much for quality control at the Kleenex plant ☹️☹️

Very disappointed. The single sheets do not release adequately because the opening is narrower than the sheets. They tear and it often takes two sheets before you get a decent one. Thought these would be a great idea for a large party rather than towels. Useless.

I like the old towels because they were more sturdy than the new softer ones. I would like to see the old formula return.

I only received 5 boxes in the shipment not 6as advertised

Need at least two towels to get hands dry

Got a second box of this pack and found the towels to lighter than the first pack I got. It tears in my hand before I can get the towel out. It appears the quality of the product has gone down. Kleenex please get your act together especially bearing in mind that the price has also gone up.

I've used these hand towels for years and am disappointed that instead of raising the price, Kleenex had to lower the quality. The last one's I bought are about the same size and weight as their tissues.  I'm sorry to say that I won't be buying them anymore.

Need 2-3 just to wipe your hands after washing; going thru two or three boxes a week.  Gave to my son to try out in his vehicle.  Will stay with towel rolls.

well the first two times I bought these they gave me the light and dark grey colors. Apparently they put a new line in with some god awful prints from a designer Betsey.. I won't buy again cause they look ridiculous in my bathroom. that set aside if you don't care what you get the savings is good and the product is good.

They’d be great, except they smell like they were stored next to rotting meat!

Box arrived in horrible condition crushedI bought these to put out for guests. Horrible presentation.

Unfortunately all six boxes that I received are in the gray family. I was hoping for at least one box in the brown family. The length of the towels remains unchanged but the width of the is smaller by 1 1/4 " than the earlier version. The texture of the towels appear to be unchanged.

UPDATED 5/2016: I should be fair that after my bad experience with smelly, scratchy Gen 3, subsequent orders (I went back to ordering eventually because there's just no good alternative) went back to Gen 2 quality-- still nowhere near as good as the original product, but usable. I agree with others that the new gaudy boxes in the mix are a big L. On the other hand, paper companies have been foisting hideous Kleenex boxes on us for decades and we put up with that, so... meh. I can live with a box designed by--I'm guessing--some crazy scrapbook lady. I've seen worse. Those original embossed boxes were the classiest ever, though, man! Like a little minimalist sculpture on the countertop! Bring those back, K-C!*-*-*-*-There must be a bestselling business book in this mystery: why do so many companies, of all sizes, feel compelled to "fix" products that are perfect, wrecking them in the process? I find it hard to believe that I am the only consumer who would rather just pay more to get the same quality if there have been increases in material or other costs that affect the company's bottom line. Especially when we are talking about a product that is positioned as a superior, premium product in the first place.Kleenex Hand Towels are the latest victim. I've used them since they came on the market, I always paid a premium for them and I would pay a higher premium to keep the unique level of quality. No such luck.Some time earlier this year they redid the box. That was a bummer because those old embossed boxes were really swell, but that's a minor thing. The change to the towels (Generation 2) themselves at that point was pretty subtle. Not as sturdy and thick, not as much a quality feel. I didn't like it as much, but I could live with it.My most recent Subscribe and Save batch that I just cracked open is a big step down even from that first change. The towels (Generation 3) feel and look even thinner, grayer and rougher, but the big problem is the new chemical smell. Since I use these on my face, that is extremely noticeable. I have some left of the original type (Generation 1) and the type from earlier this year (Gen 2) and I compared them. I can pick out the brand new ones (Gen 3) with my eyes closed because of the strong smell. The box, SKU, etc are identical to Gen 2.I'm actually going to send these back to Amazon, although I feel bad because it's not their fault. Since Amazon is one of the few companies in America that seems to understand giving customers what they want, I am hoping that if they have to eat some returns,  they will in turn crack some skulls over at Kimberly-Clark. So I encourage those of you who agree with me to do returns as well. I am going to call the Kleenex customer service number, but we all know that won't do any good. ("In order to serve you better, we have reformulated our product. Our extensive market research shows that consumers love the new feel of Kleenex Hand Towels. Thank you for contacting us.") On the other hand, some guy at Amazon who moves a zillion dollars a year of merchandise from Kimberly-Clark yelling in their ear, that might actually get results.

I really like this product and have ordered it for a long time but, as with the tissues, my home is very neutral and these bright colors and patterns don’t match anything. Please provide both neutral and bright color options!

We’ve been buying these towels for quite a while now. They’ve always worked well and they are so much better than trying to keep up with cloth towels that have to be changed often, or deal with their sour smell. The only thing we dislike about them is the new designed boxes. They are now so “loud” that they stick out like a sore thumb on our bathroom counter. We preferred the old box design that was more conservative and better fit our bathroom decor.

The reason for the low rating is, there is quite a bit of waste when you first open the box to get it started. You loose about 5-6 towels.

Not sure who the package designers are at Kleenex but they need to rethink the tacky box designs. Surely does not match with bathroom decor outside of children's decor.

I received the product and they weren’t damaged. I was REALLY excited for the pretty fruit designs on the boxes. Sadly all the boxes I received were beige or light grey. It says “packaging may vary” but I didn’t think it would vary quite this much. I could have purchased this design locally. Still totally functional but not as fun.

These were so soft and now not soft and more scratchy

What I ordered in the first photo and what I got in the second.I know under the box the product is the same. And this product is very good. But that is not the point.So if you are ordering based on photos I urge caution.  This seems to be happening more and more at Amazon.

The new 2013 box is noticeably smaller than the previous one, which is nice for your bathroom towel rack.  However, the number of towels in a box and the length and width of the towels is the same as the old.  So how can they fit them in the smaller box?  I think they are packed a little tighter, but somehow they are not as thick as the old ones.  I say "somehow" because when I first pulled a new towel out it felt lighter, softer, and thinner than the old ones.  But when I compared them side by side, to my surprise the difference was much less...the older ones just seemed rougher to the touch but not necessarily heavier.I decided to do a strength test.  I grabbed an OLD towel in both hands in front of me (like grasping a steering wheel) and sharply and quickly stretched the towel. 3-4 times it was solid and didn't rip.  Then I tried the same test with the NEW towel.  On the second stretch both sides ripped!  I repeated the test with two more towels from the old and new, and the same result.So yes, somehow the new towels are softer and more importantly less durable.  However, I still find them acceptable for their purpose and have not had any problems with them ripping when trying to pull them from the box.  After all, it's a paper towel - don't treat it like a sheet of Kevlar.  All that being said, just like any paper towel you will still be using 2 in order to completely dry your hands.And note to Kleenex:  Yes, apparently we DID notice that tiny change you made to save a few pennies...Why do people insist on fixing things that aren't broken?

I have ordered many times before and liked  this product very much.  When I seen the new fun colors, I ordered them right away. However, the photo was misleading because I received the same old colored boxes. 😔

Good value.  These are hard for me to find in the stores.  I was not happy that some came smashed and the boxes won't stand on their own as they should.

Please bring back the geometric and gold tone box designs. They were nice, these look cheap.

Last couple orders, Kleenex Corporation has been very lacking with respect to quality of packaging. Quality Control issues! The box containing the individual boxes is crushed in with a very particular pattern completely around the box. The Kleenex are still usable but it is sad that quality control is really suffering regarding the packaging and the individual boxes are not tearing at the perforations without ripping the plastic off with it. I can tell the package issue is NOT from Amazon transporting them. It's obvious by other observations that the boxes are taped AFTER being crushed in. The taping is not creased or shows no sign of having been distorted. Also Amazon obviously doesn't package the individual boxes within. I only noticed QC issues after about 2 months into the COVID lockdowns. So I firmly believe that Quality Control has become a low priority for Kleenex Corporation. The inner boxes are damaged when the outer box is crushed while being packaged in the outer box at the factory.

This paper product is okay as it is a good paper towel for the bathrooms.  But it's very expensive.  I would  have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the price and the # of towel in a box.

I bought a case of these .Box was a dented up along with damage boxes inside case .

I needed some way for people to dry their hands in a tiny (teeny tiny....  so very very tiny) powder room in the house.  There really isn't much room for a towel bar (although now I am thinking that might have been the better way to go) and a paper towel rack would have looked pretty ridiculous, so I purchased these and I am kind of sorry I did.  The boxes are not attractive and the little (emphasis on little) hand towels are okay but nothing spectacular.  Not that I expect spectacularity from a hand towel, but these things feel a bit skimpy to me.I looked around for a dispenser that I could perhaps put the towels into to improve their appearance ( I really dislike the odd shape of the box -- I thought I would like it but seeing it up close, I don't) but I couldn't find one.  I don't think these will fit in a normal tissue dispenser, will they?BOTTOM LINE: Look, they aren't terrible but I just expect more from the kleenex brand and these fall short in my opinion.  When I finish these six boxes I will be looking for another solution.  Comment back to me if you have any good ideas.

I have purchased these in the past through Amazon and they were ok, just pretty overpriced.  But now I just ordered this six pack and when it came, there were only four inside the box, and one of them was completely smashed.  I had the issue with smashed packages before, but to be missing a third of what I paid for, especially since they're overpriced to begin with, is ridiculous.

The tissues were fine but the boxes were all bent up.

These are like double thick tissues.  These hardly qualify as paper towels.  While you can use them to dry your hands, it just seems such a waste as they don't always do the job.  Then there's the matter of how much space they take up.  Just something else to take space from your counter.  If they were a bit more decorative, that might help somewhat.  I think the main sell is the unique slant on the top of the box.  I tried them in a  towel rack upside down...  That's not very handy either... as they seem to be behind the towel bar and kept getting stuck there.  These could be used in a vehicle on a road trip for clean up a vehicle as they sit fairly well between your seat and the console... push them in.  But they're expensive for what they are...or at least I think so.  I think tissues are just as good for most everything and I'll use the towel that should be hanging on my towel bar instead of hanging one of these boxes in it's place.

I had purchased kleenex hand towels previously in the grocery store that were large and soft.  These are much cheaper.  They are not soft and are not large.  These are expensive at nearly 8 cents per towel....and not really all that different than c-fold towels that are MUCH less expensive.

Usually get them from my local grocery store. Once the price went up I started looking at online options. Amazon had the best price. I use them to pat my face dry after washing. They have a weird chemical smell to them. No break out or nothing … Yet. Besides the smell everything‘s good

These are what I wanted. Can't find in the grocery store anymore. They sit on your towel rack in the bathroom and dispense one at a time. More hygienic than a cloth towel that gets reused. Only 2 things I don't like:  didn't really want to buy 6 boxes at a time for a guest bath that is rarely used; wish the box were a solid neutral color instead of patterned in strange colors that make them tacky. Had I thought about it I might have just sealed the packing box back up and returned them.

The whole idea of having an angled side of the box is that you should be able to set it upside down on a rack and pull downwards to pull a towel out. Instead, I got ordinary tissue-style square boxes. This sort of defeats the purpose. In the past, I ordered and got the correct kind. I added both past and current pics as a comparison. See the image of the package of the three angles boxes (correct) as opposed to the one with the rectangular boxes that I received. The disposable towels themselves are fine and the same as before. Just beware that you may not actually get what is advertised.

I like the concept how it can be put on a towel rack.  I absorb well and quick, but the size saturates fully with my big hands not leaving them completely dry like other Kleenex Hand Towels.  I was disappointed with the size of the sheet 9x8" and that can explain why it really left my hands a little moist once it was saturated.  The softness is amazing. This product would be amazing if it were 2 or 3 inches bigger.

Product is on Auto Reorder.  Got shorted. Then was to arrive on "x" day by 8pm.  Arrived late.  Come on AMAZON, you are better than this!!As far as these hand towels - they are the BEST!!!  With COVID-19, it does no good to spend 20 seconds washing your hands, only to dry them with a bath or hand towel.  THESE ARE DISPOSABLE ONE (1) time use.  Don't spread germs by using a dirty towel.  This is what you need!

Like to give it 5 stars, however towels don't come out of the box easily.

I think this idea is terrific and was excited to have them.  They are just no absorbent enough and you need 2 of them, so it really increases the cost even more.  Too bad because it's a good idea.  Another thing I would suggest is that the boxes say something on them (aesthetically) indicating they are hand towels because it really just looks like a big tissue box - so unless you place it on a towel rack as they show, (again pretty good idea), it's not 100% apparent that they are not oversized tissues.  I would not buy them again. :(

please bring back the elegant and subdue pattern!

These towels are quite handy to have around!  I had originally had them as an ongoing delivery so that I would not run out, but there was such a large price increase the last time around that I cancelled the automatic reorder, and will most likely not use them after I have used up the ones that I have now.  If I were not under budget restraints as a senior citizen, I would use them continually because they are handy--and since they come in sheets they do not need to be torn off of a roll--and they are absorbent and efficient.

I love Kleenex towels for their ease of use and help in germ control. I took away two stars, not because of the product itself, but because at the time of purchase I had the option of choosing "new" style box or "old." Old was slightly more expensive and that was my choice because the old style works better in my home decor. So I paid the slightly higher  price. However, what I received was the new version instead!

When I went to order green &/or brown boxed paper towels, noticed a statement that new  version of item now available,  and it was offered for less money. However, new versions have horrid ugly mustard yellow stripes or designs (depending on version), so I sprang for the small amount extra and ordered the old versions that were pictured. Nevertheless,  received the  strongly disliked (by me) new version with the ugly mustard color.

Love the product, but three shipments ago they changed the packaging to a smaller sized box, making the towelettes packed-in more tightly… Consequently the first dozen or so usually rip when you try to pull them out.My whole family complains, and the grandchildren have a real problem with them, so usually come out of the bathroom with wet hands!Very inconvenient.Poorly thought out, "packaging team!"If they don't fix the problem soon, I'll cancel my long-standing order and go back to using the smaller sheets of paper towels, which if I am honest, cost less and work as well. I just liked the convenience and look of these until the packaging change…Too bad they may have killed off what was a great product with a newer, poor packaging design!Three months ago, I was telling everyone to buy them… Now I tell them not to bother!

Definitely has a funky smell, I can’t describe it. Not sure if it’s just mine but I have to hold my breath when drying my face. They’re really soft which is nice, especially since I’m using them specifically to dry my face. I won’t return them because I don’t mind them, they do what they’re supposed to do. But I probably won’t buy these specifically again.

One of the boxes came dented up.

Missing one box from carton in todays delivery

I love these towels, especially for guests and in my office. They are strong, but soft and absorbent.  HOWEVER, the last two times I ordered them, they snuck in a few boxes with a horrible design on them that probably didn't sell anywhere else.  It has a bright pink floral and hearts graphic with caution yellow, bright blue and black & white checks in the background (a "Betsey" design).  I can't imagine that it goes with the decor in many bathrooms.  In my most recent shipment, 3 out of the 6 boxes have this design.  I'm super disappointed.  Please bring back the neutral colors!!  Then, I will rate these a 5.

Like others have mentioned there were only 5 boxes out of the six. Which makes these more expensive than the local stores. Shame on them

Bought these so they would look good sitting out for company to use and no quality control. Boxes came damaged inside the cardboard box. Paper towels themselves are soft.

I bought these to place (inverted) on my towel bar for guests, as shown in the product listing. The box was much too large to use this way, and I don’t have the counter space for it to stand alone... returned item.

It supposed to have 6 boxes, right?

I always order these and keep the on stock this time when filling my stock some of the boxes were empty...sadif not for this I would have given a 5 star.

Yes they work, but it always took two to dry my hands, and I needed two lands to get a towel, because I had to hold on to the box while grasping a towel, or the box would come off the towel bar, or where ever I sat it.

The box is from Kleenex.  Only 5 out of the 6 towel boxes were in the box.  Some were damaged/smashed.

I have been using Kleenex Hand towels for a very long time and love them, until I saw that they changed the box and quality of towel. smaller and more inferior quality. I will have to think about purchasing these in the future. I buy 12 boxes a month. KLEENEX you have messed up.Jshere6000

Convenient, easy to find and order.

I was trying to reach someone to discuss this with but didn't see an area. Each of these packages contains 6 boxes. One of the packages only contained 5 of 6 boxes.

Enjoy the convenience of this product and the true convenience of delivery; however, the carton arrived badly crushed on one corner and the towels are stuffed into each box so they do not dispense properly. Not sure if these are "seconds" or some such but I did not save enough money to receive so much less than I would receive at a retail outlet. I will not return be because it too annoying, but I doubt I will order again.

We love this product. Great for small bathrooms.This package contained 2 of the boxes damaged (bent boxes)

I like ordering a case of these because it comes 6 in a case. What I don't like is it comes sorted and sometimes you get the ugliest colors. I use those ugly color boxes for the Master bath and use the better looking ones for the guest bath. Price is only slightly less than buying at Target, but at Target I get to pick the colors.

In my opinion one of these does not adequately dry my hands, and they are small.  If I have to use two every time, I might as well buy a better quality one that I would only need one at a time.

I love how easy these are to use for guests and feel they are worth the value for everyone to have a clean hand towel. The absorb water on your hands great, and are soft to the touch! I love the variety of box colors as well!

I recently purchased the Kleenex towels and I am very impressed with their performance. The towels are strong and absorbent, making them perfect for cleaning up spills or drying hands. I also love that they are disposable, making clean up quick and easy. The packaging is convenient and fits well in my bathroom. Overall, I highly recommend these towels for anyone looking for a reliable and durable option. Now I have an Amazon subscription on these .

I'm intrigued by the comments about how they used to be better because I think that the current product (purchased for the first time about 6 weeks ago, just reordered) is pretty great.  I think it might depend on what your intended use for them is.  I purchased them for blotting my face dry after washing it.  I have very sensitive/reactive skin that is prone to redness, acne, dryness, dermatitis, etc. and realized that reusing a cloth towel to dry off with might not have been the best idea in terms of bacteria.  I started using normal paper towel (roll) to blot dry but storing it in my bathroom was inconvenient, which is what makes these so great.  I don't have a towel bar/rack in my bathroom (hooks and a ring instead) so I can't do the upside down dispenser method as pictured.  I have a narrow storage tower with shelves, so I put these on a shelf horizontally (dispensing end out, obviously) under a box of cosmetics.  This is a great set-up for me since they take up very little extra space this way and are conveniently within reach.  The towels themselves are nice and soft, as well as fairly absorbent and strong (comparable to Viva, probably not quite as strong but a little softer which is nice for facial use).  After gently blotting my face dry, I dry my hands with the same towel before applying toner and moisturize.  Honestly, the only downside for me is that they're a little too convenient!  I bought them for the use described above, but have ended up with a box in every room (except for the kitchen/living area where I have a roll dispenser).  They make good napkins and even a decent tissue in a pinch.  They're a bit pricey (and small) to use for cleaning in my opinion, so I'm going to try to be a little more strict about my usage of them for other purposes this time around.  But that's probably not going to go very well since they really are incredibly convenient.

Best replacement for those expensive auto-order face towels.  (you know the ones I'm talking about) These feel the same, maybe even better, at a fraction of the cost.  Not to mention, but they also come in a cute, jaunty box.Great for guest bathrooms where no one is sure if they count as the guest who is actually allowed to use the guest towels that we're all saving for that unexpected visit by the princess of Wales. Use them, toss them.  Life is good.  No more washing extra towels to keep your face clean; no more guessing if you're qualified to use guest towels.  Fun for everyone!

I have a family child care and I buy these monthly, Amazon has the best price!  The hand towels works for my little people after they are done washing their hands. The water absorbs well and will always be my go to.

OK, I really love these. They are so convenient to use, absorbent, thick, and non-shedding, and are sanitary vs the standard hand towels in home bathrooms. However, the manufacturer changed the design and color to a less-than serene appearance.  They are now very bright, with unappealing designs/colors. Please consider reverting to the prior neutral, calming tones and patterns.  I will put my Sub/Save on HOLD until then.

Strong, efficient, convenient, adorable, space saving, impeccable cleaning ability, soft, and best of all it doesn't leave any fibers or residue behind! I am in love with this product; thank you for this amazing towel!

Perfect product for guest room. Nice absorbency. Looks nice.  Can sit on counter,  or hang upside down on towel bar.Good price, and value.

These are much more hygienic than using the gross towel on a hook in your bathroom to dry your hands. I have one box in my bathroom and one by the kitchen sink. They’re durable and one is enough to dry both hands completely. These are essential especially when dealing with raw meat in the kitchen. I no longer use paper towels to dry off my hands, only these. I also keep a couple towels in my purse, in case I ever have to use a public bathroom and the bathroom doesn’t have paper towels, or I use these as a disposable handkerchief. I can’t recommend these enough!

Love these great way to stop the spread of germs in a bathroom kitchen or a bedroom. They  bb are n thick individual napkins like.

These can be used for everything, everywhere.  However..these extremely ugly boxes wants me to hide them taking away from the need as a quick solution!

For me, too expensive for everyday use. But would use if hosting a party at home, as it’s much more hygienic than 10-20 people (or more) sharing one hand-towel. They’re thick and absorbent, high quality. One thing that’s a bit of a pain is that it is challenging to pull one towel without pulling up on the box itself. Wish there was a heavier dispenser these could go into.

These are nice towels, sometimes I even feel bad throwing the, away after drying my hands...forcing me to find something to clean ;-)We use these towels in all our bathrooms, but they get the most use in our main/guest bathroom. They are soft but sturdy, easy to use, convenient, and most of all, SANITARY!! As the mother of 5 kids, I was always bothered by how dirty our hand towels were, those were dirt and germs being spread through my family, I was always washing hand towels(like daily), and I knew there had to be a better solution.I tried washcloths that would be used once then washed, however, you have NO IDEA how much laundry this makes in a 7person household, nor did even I have any idea how many washcloths needed to be purchased to make this a viable option. The 80 that I purchased just didnt cut it, I needed about 4-5 times that...this also requires keeping a "nice set" for company separate from the family use towels.I found a coupon for these hand towels on s&s and decided to give them a try, if I didnt like them as hand towels, I could use them for papertowels. They are perfect hand towels!! They keep everything sanitary, are soft enough to use on faces(even baby faces), and the dispenser is nice for setting on a towel rack(which is also my only complaint). I can fit 2 side by side on my bath towel rack(and have a decorative towel on my hand towel ring).These hold up well wet and dry, my 3yr old uses them to cover her eyes when washing her hair and then proceeds to use it as a washcloth, it does well. I have also grabbed them to clean bathroom messes, again, they hold up to multiple rinsings and ringings and scrubbings.I am removing a star for 2 reasons.1)the dispenser, while fitting on my towel rack, is a bit top heavy and has a tendency to topple down. I do have a narrow towel bar to wall opening, so maybe others wont have this issue.2)I wish they made a refillable dispenser, throwing away 6-8 boxes each month just seems like such a waste(yes, I know this is a small issue compared with all the towels being thrown away and yes it is all recyclable(towels and box), but still).The negatives are a fine trade off in comparison to the sanitation issues I was facing in a household of children(no matter how many times we do handwashing training, they just dont get it...but it does eventually sink in, my 14yr old is an expert hand washer now ;-))So, if you are looking for a great, recyclable, sanitary hand towel, look no further...but be aware that you will likely have the cleanest bathroom in the neighborhood as you wont be able to resist drying you hands and proceeding to wipe up the sink, mirror, door handle, etc :-)

Had to write and say when I originally did the subscribe and save  the  box design was so much better and neutral to bathroom decor.  NOT a fan of the new designs and colors 😕

I have been buying this towel for many years. Great product. Yery soft and affordable.Not so good: 1. Ordered two boxes of six. All previous orders have come packaged by Kleenex in a box of six, and I never had any damage issues. These were re-boxed by Amazon in Amazon boxes. Every one of the 12 pieces are either torn or crushed. Seems odd since Amazon double boxed these.  2. Too much of a hassle to return, so this may be my last purchase of my favorite soft paper towel if packaging is not improved.

One of my neighbors has used these disposable towels in her guest/powder bathrooms for some time, that why I decided to get them.  They are handy to use rather than a cloth towel that gets quite wet when you have multiple visitors in your home.  These towels are a better and more sanitary way for guests to dry their hands after using the bathroom.

I started using these a few years ago after my foot was amputated, I had a lot of nurses, physical therapist, and home health aids in and out of the house and didn't want them using the hand towels in my only bathroom ( I live in a Manhattan 2 bedroom 1 bath) and found they worked great with some antibacterial soap I was good to go, and I'm still in and out of the hospital and still have a lot of different people in and out of my house as well as friends. I loved the box design and it was a perfect fit for between the medicine cabinet and a shelf I have up in there and because I liked the way the white looked against the chocolate walls I removed the towels and stapled the box to the wall and replaced the towels (I tried heavy duty tape at first but it was always leaning off the wall) and I use light tape to keep the top closed. The great thing is when I want to change the box color it's easy to remove the box you just pull it from the wall and repeat the staple steps. I see a lot of people comment about the quality of the towels and while they were thicker and a little larger in the beginning you really get what you pay for and when you buy in bulk you can't really complain, when I use to get these in the supermarket they were $5.99 a box thus tax here in Manhattan and buying in bulk here on amazon they're a little under $3.00 a box so I'm not going to complain I have seen hand towels that are thicker and larger but they also cost more (45 in a pack for $5.99 and that's on Amazon, no dispenser box...you have to put them on a flat surface and for people with kids of messy other half's that could mean wet towels) Overall I enjoy the product and even use them myself from time to time I took away 1 star for changing the quality of the product  I didn't care so much about the size change. A lot of the nurses loved the Ideal and have mentioned it to some of their patients. I do hope that Kleenex continues to make this product as I hear that it now hard to find in the stores.

Container is perfect for my powder room.

Kleenex is always a good product.Kind of costly but convenient for on the go,

Wish there was a non-bleached option because I know how hard the bleaching to white is on the environment. And less expensive!

I really like the convenience and the sanitary nature of these however I've always thought they were expensive.  Basically it's a paper towel in a cute box.  But cost per sheet is much more than a tear away paper towel.  However, the box looks nicer in the bathroom and is a little more sanitary.

Boxes are hideous- must use another holder. A tad pricey

I really like these towels sand the price is great. But the colors and patterns are terrible. Doesn’t match anything in most bathroom. Would recommend more neutral colors and patterns or just solid colors.

I really love these hand towels but what I didn’t like is that they came with a different design on the boxes. I was drawn to the product because of the colorful packaging.

I always like to keep these in bathroom but was disappointed to receive the old boxes because I ordered an extra box to get new design but got the same as the first 🤷🏼‍♀️

The towels are good but they did not come in the cute designs as advertised!  I was looking forward to getting something bright for my bathrooms etc. and instead it's gold  green and gray abstract designs.  Disappointed.

If these were a bit bigger they would be a 5 star product.  But overall I do like them and will buy again.

Bathroom

Love this product Will continue to buy this item

Not a fan of new colors of boxes.

Great disposable hand towels, but the perforated opening at the top doesn’t rip cleanly, and some of the boxes I received were misshapen because of how they were glued. Need additional quality control checks

Tissues could be softer

Love it for parties use it all the timeVery popular in my home

home use

Very convenient but a little pricey

These are great to use for blowing your nose when you have allergies.

I keep these in my car, bathroom and office. Absorbent and thick

kleenex good, money spent bad. Costco has it way lower

These are a little thinner than paper towels, but the packaging makes it possible for me to prop up on a towel rack in the bathroom.  My fiance has home dialysis and we have to thoroughly wash and dry our hands with paper towels whenever we hook up and unhook him.  It's an easy alternative to putting in a paper towel rack.The problem with this order is that of the 6 boxes I received, one was sealed but completely empty!Amazon resolved the issue but the problem was probably at the Kimberly-Clark factory.  (On the bottom it was stamped " N 8 361 10:54") It was a charcoal grey colored box.I wish that Bounty paper towels, which are much sturdier, sold a version in a box like this.  I also wish these were cheaper.

Great alternative to had towels

I like this product and use it regularly in my bathrooms. I like the idea of having a clean, fresh  towel every time I wash my hands. I dislike to take hold of a towel that is already wet and somewhat soiled. Why wash your hand and then dry them with someone else's used fabric towel? I wish they were a little larger. I think most people with bigger hands would appreciate that. A box gets used up pretty quickly. The towels are nice and soft and absorbent. The Amazon price was good too. In my area the towels are usually "on sale" for $2.99 at the grocery store. At Amazon the six pack came out to be about $2.35 using Prime.I will continue to use these towels unless the price gets much higher.

I ordered these after renovating our bathroom and preparing for a large family gathering. Since my initial order of 6 boxes, I have ordered another case.Each hand towel is sufficient to dry a person's hands.  I like the ease of the dispensing one towel at a time when opening the box.  The problem comes when nearing the last 20 or so towels and they no longer 'pop up' which causes a person to dig in the box to retrieve a towel.  Despite this minor annoyance, I like the product and how it feels on my hands. It is soft and supple and has good absorption.  On occasion I have used them to take care of minor clean ups on the bathroom counter and they hold up as well as most paper towels.  I also take one into the shower with  me to wash my face each morning and they get the job done. Tney are definitely a one time use product!

I have been buying these towels for a few years now and since they are no longer available in stores I have had too buy online. Price and availability seem to fluctuate alot. I think these hand towels are a good product but with shipping costs to Canada somewhat overpriced.

The newest sheets may be a bit smaller than the originals and I am not sure about reduced thickness, but I find them useful, for example, after washing my hands prior to food preparation and I want to be sure of a sanitary drying. They are also useful as a box of "guest towels" when entertaining. Another review somewhere talked of an odor to the towels. Try as I may I can not find any objectionable odor when they are either wet or dry. New smaller box may make automatic feeding of sheets through top more reliable. Late added note after more usage: You may find yourself sometimes using two towels to dry your hands but that is not always the case. It depends on the situation of usage. Some may consider it more of an "enhanced" tissue rather than a "lighter duty" paper towel. A product you will like or maybe not but I find them useful with a reservation. Others may disagree with a four-star rating.

Have these on subscription service love them for my bathroom. Better than paper towels and more sanitary than using a hand towel.

These things are handy to have in your guest bathroom or the kids.  They are kind of pricey compared to a good roll of paper towels.  The dispenser box makes it superior to just having a big ole roll of paper towels on the bathroom counter.  If you dont want to share bathroom germs with your guests then get these.  I keep a box in my kids bathroom and our guest bathroom.  I am so grossed out about sharing a community towel with everyone.  No thanks.

I used these disposable hand towels in both of my bathrooms long before the pandemic for sanitation purposes as I don't feel cloth towels are sanitary, & I don't have a hand dryer. They could increase their marketability by decreasing the cost.

I love everything about this item the only con is you have to use 2 hands as box lifts up. A hard cover would make it perfect!

I'm on the auto delivery plan with these great towels.  Great for guests, makeup and soft on nose.  One problem, I was getting the plan box design, now they're sending the most ugly designs I've ever seen.  They look like they came out of the 60's.  Who thinks up this crap.  Whoever came up with and whomever approved these patterns have the worst taste ever.  I'm going to cancel my auto shipment till they come to their senses.  They didn't ask for stars on design which would be a minute 5, but I can't knock the actual hand towel they're great.

I really appreciate this product for drying hands and sometimes for cleaning, but the price is a deal breaker if it goes above 10-12$ it's not worth it just bye some paper towels, because a box last a week and I have 2 bathrooms so a box of 6 don't last a month,and your paying for the box more than the towels, I'm thinking about investing in the wall unit that you get 1000+ towels same or better quality for 20$ the investment is the wall unit,kinda like the good hand soap with the wall unit, but in the long run it will be cheaper,they sell them hear on Amazon!

I love these hand towels. They are thick and absorbent.

Perfect to elevate any bathroom. Still disposable and easy to use but it looks prettier!

I use way to many because of the convenience but that’s on a good note. You can’t find these in stores around me so I buy these all the time from Amazon

I use these in our Cape vacation home. I keep a box in each bathroom. Every person gets a nice clean towel to use after washing their hands.

I love these towels to keep in the bathroom, my guest’s also liked these. More sanitary then putting a hand towel that everyone uses. No washing just throw away. Soft and strong.

Bought these to use during a party.  One in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  Really absorbent and picked up spills quickly.  Easier and quicker to use than pulling off of a roll. Also, box was pretty.  Would like to see designs with muted colors and patterns.

These make great guest towels for the bathroom. It keeps your guest from using your show towel’s

We have them in every car. Think of these as something tougher than a Kleenex, and in a more convenient package than a roll of bounty. Yeah, you can use them as hand towels, but in a pinch you can use them to clean a small mess too.

I pull these out at gatherings when a hand towel is gross by the 4th bathroom break and leaves people drying their hands on a wet towel. Keep a couple on hand and pull out for guests!

I like to have these in the bathroom when guests are over. Keeps the towels from getting soggy & no germ sharing

Use these in bathrooms in my salon, very thick and absorbing and cute patterns on box

So great in the guest bathroom, I now longer have to wash my good towels every time I have guest or grandkids stop by.

Perfect size for the car

I love having these towels in my bathroom. They insure you don’t get someone else’s germs. My hands feel very fresh and clean after using them.

I keep a box in my bathroom for guests. They are good for not spreading germs.

Nice for small bathroom with no place to hang hand towels

I use these in my bathroom, kitchen, garage and car. Really love them. I took 1 box to my brother in nursing home and he likes it better than regular Kleenex or Puffs ,- much more sturdier

These hand towels are pretty thick. Have bought a few times.

These can be hung upside down behind a towel rack.Much easier than having many hand towels.

The subject hand towels are convenient to use and effective for drying hand’s especially in bathrooms. Box is pretty for use in bathrooms.

THESE HANG ON MY TOWEL RACK AND I CAN PULL ONE OUT AT A TIME

Very absorbent and easy to dispense.  I hang a box from a towel rack next to the sink.

I recently added these to my skin care, instead of using a face cloth and washing it every couple times. My skin has definitely cleared up!

We love these bathroom hand towels. We've been using them for years now. We still have hand towels by the sinks but the paper towels are more convenient for us. Our daughter first started using them at her condo since she's not home much and laundry is a bigger chore for her.We found it cost effective and a better use of our time to use these towel dispensers at our house. One thing about this product is consistency. Some products change and then change again. Not the same with paper hand towels. This is a good product at a fair price and having it arrive on a schedule is first rate.

Excellent product/good price

Nice to have instead of everyone using the same hand towel. Just makes sense from a practical standpoint

I love these kleenex towels. I used to buy them at cvs but now I buy them on Amazon by the case. I keep a box in all of the bathrooms. Best quality paper towels and the boxes have pretty designs. I love that they give you a variety.

Hey, they are definitely a splurge. Regardless, you cannot beat these for convenience. They are so soft, and at the same time, surprisingly strong. Perfect for face washing or drying, my favorite uses.I keep these out for guest towels, too. The boxes are attractive, and the disposable aspect makes guests comfortable. No icky germs from hand towels!I have these on regular delivery. If you like them, too, I recommend that. It’s nice never to be out of supply at home.

Perfect to dry you hands and wipe sink down and throw away. Nice and thick and only need one for the job.

These fit perfectly in the door of my car so I use at least 4 in each!  Best napkins out there!!!

These single-use facial towels are so soft and absorbent! Stop using all multi-use cloth towels!!You can set them on the sink or sit them on top of the towel rack to dispense downward without any effort.This is my second purchase and will be buying more!

A little pricey but a nice addition to the bathroom. I hope my guests know it’s ok to use them.  they didn’t want to use my other decorative paper towels because they were too pretty LOL

I keep these in the bathroom for visitors so they don't have to use it the same hand towel.  Prevents messes around the sink.  Very convenient and clean.

Great for the bathroom, love the different color boxes. Easy to use, great performance

We use these in the bathroom closest to the outside door.  After working in the garden, the last thing I want to do is to use my wife’s nice cloth hand towels. These work wonderfully well! They are strong, yet soft. Not crazy about the box’s imprinted design, but they are just what I need!

I ordered these for both sets of grandchildren to teach them to use a clean towel each time they wash their hands. Flus and viruses were rampant in their elementary schools, so I thought this would be a good tool for them to wipe their hands after each hand wash or tooth brushing without using the same towel over and over. They are good hand washers, but use the same hand towel over and over, or until mom changes it. I’m hoping to make it easy and fun for them by using these towels and that they create good hygiene habits.

This product is sturdy, easy to use and it’s nice to sit on a towel rack for the ease of use. The absorption is good.

I like the towels. It saves using cloth towels especially with guests. I like that it is one use and throw away. My issue is the box needs to be heavier to pull out the towels. I need to find an enclosure or some weight to put at the bottom. when pulling a towel sometimes the box lifts up.

These are wonderful paper towels for applying face creams and lotions, toners and liquids (I cut the towel in 9 squares for these), holds up to basic cleaning and just a great disposable hand towel.They do not fall apart when when cleaning the sink, wiping the mirrors or the other bath fixtures.I was concerned for a time that they had stop making them,  I was having a hard time finding them in the stores. So thank you Amazon Seller

Excellent clean absorbing perfect for powder room sink will never be without them

Been working around paper (print shop) for 55 years. This is not even close to 22#! In fact, it isn't even close to 20#! It has absolutely no texture at all and doesn't even look like "paper"! Can't imagine this will feed properly or ever dry without smearing. The color isn't even right! Back it goes. I definitely do NOT recommend this paper for anything!

The plastic wrapping on the paper was all the off and numerous pages of paper wee crumpled and not usable. It looked like it had been placed in the shipping box after the wrapping came loose. HP Papers | 8.5 x 11 Paper | All In One 22 lb | 1 Mega Ream - 750 Sheets | 96 Bright | Made in USA - FSC Certified | 207750R

Update as of 17:54 04.09.24As for HP copy paper  pack, I thought only top part was teared and damaged. However, when Itried to pull out the pack, I realized that its wrapping was totally toned.  More than that, the  there were green mold like things on some of papers in already tones wrapping. Please see 2 more photos just added.*****This box just arrived but part of box is damaged and taped top is half ripped. When I opened the box, HP copy paper’s wrap was teared and some papers were wrinkled. Seeing exterior of this box, it looks like it was quite throwing around and some oily stains here and there. Quite disappointing thing. What happened to this delivery???

I wanted to use this paper for printing. However it is so thin that 7-8 sheets rolls up as it start printing abs jams my printer. I tried to get paper tray out, but the roll of paper wouldn't allow me to open paper tray. I wish I had tried it right away, I would have seen the poor quality.  No matter how much or how little I put in tray, it rolls up and won't print. When I finally got it to print 5-6 pages came out at once, and the printed page was warped like wet newspaper . PLEAE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER, unless you're getting it for the children to use as scrap paper.

Here is a side-by-side comparison to a cheap chain store 92, Bright, 20# paper. The one on the left is from the chain store and the one on the right is the one I received from Amazon. It is definitely far lighter weight than a 20# and definitely more significantly more dull. And guess what? I don’t think I can return it, because there is no option to return it. What a rip off! The last time I got paper like this it jammed up my machine, and I had to buy a new printer. Shame on HP.

Both ends were ripped open. If I knew package was damaged I wouldn't have bought it. Why am I not getting reimburse for my taxes paid on this item? This is so wrong!

This computer paper was completely open inside a large box which looked like it might’ve also have been opened.

There was no internal padding and the paper was crunched. Paper was good quality if it wasn't damaged by lazy packing.

Paper products have really went down hill.  I needed a thicker paper ive tried the 22 and 24 but they both feel like the 20 paper I can get at Walmart for $5 some change.  I made the mistake of opening the package do now Im not able to return.  I will go back too buying my paper at walmart.  I recommend feeling they thickness before ripping off the packaging!!!

As at least one other reviewer has noted, this paper feels as if it's not really 22# paper.  My HP ink-jet printer also doesn't like it when doing double-sided printing -- most pages don't get printed properly.  I've used other HP 22# paper in the past that was fine.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won't be ordering any more of this type after I exhaust the remaining 700 sheets.  Actually, I think I'll just donate this to a youngster I know for refrigerator art projects, and order 24# now and cross my fingers.

paper won't go through the printer without jam every other time

I received it already open, what am I supposed to do? Count the 750 sheets?

This paper is so thin, it keeps jamming up my printer!

Paper arrived completely damaged and unusable.

All 4 corners are bent but they still work. I will NOT buy again.

HP Paper is great paper, but don't buy it online. Mine came with the packaging all busted, and the paper was damaged. Although Amazon returned it with no problem, I will not order paper online again.

The item was opened and cover was split open

The quality of this paper suggest that it should cost 1.00

Too thin. Doesn’t support itself, see through print.

The paper arrived torn open and dirty

The two packages of paper were delivered mashed, thus, many sheets were unusable.

This paper broke my Printer.  My printer started giving me constant errors stating there was no paper when it was full.  It would never print again.

Caused constant jams. Paper sizes vary. Eventually ruined my printer.DO NOT BUY!

When I purchased the product it showed delivery within a week. After two weeks it shows it’s still two weeks away. *sigh*I’m sure the paper is great if you can get it.

I am extremely upset..the offer on this paper on 750 sheets was an additional bonus ream.it was VERY EXPENSIVE but with additional ream was ok. ALSO when shipped it was on box with my monthly subscription order..too many items in box which caused the wrapper on paper to rip apart. Paper was a mess! STILL waiting for replacements as well as bonus ream.

Nothing but Jams.Using an HP Office Jet printer, I can't put more than one piece in the tray without it jamming. I'm trying to get a refund from HP.I replaced the paper with GP and it works fine.

Was supposed to be delivered today April 24. But now its saying May 22?

Bought this paper with the sole intent of printing pages double sided, as it was listed as being "made" for every day double-sided printing, but ink bleeds through when attempting to print pages double-sided.

I have used this paper for many years and preferred it as the best multi-purpose paper due to 22lb weight (sheets not too thick) and yet at 97 brightness. The brightness has now gone down, and 96 vs 97 IS noticeable. Staples has the 97 brightness version still.

Nothing wrong with the paper. With a prime membership it took 9 days for delivery. Sold and shipped by Amazon. Don’t order this paper unless you’re willing to wait a week and a half to get it.

Do not understand the huge amount of great reviews for this flimsy paper. The printouts look cheap and it’s see through but if you don’t care about paper quality, I guess this is for you

First of all Amazon packed this in plastic packaging which destroyed the packaging (not HP fault) However this is the thinnest 22LB paper I have ever used. I highly doubt it is anywhere close. I use 20LB Hammermill which is thicker than this paper. Buyer beware.

I typically use 24 lb paper for my printer.  I decided to try this because price was low.  It is probably 20 lb (or less) paper.

All markable ratings above are 3 and 4, but had to give it only a 2 star rating because the paper jams up a lot.  Finally had to switch to a different paper as I was up and down to the printer unjamming the paper so much.  Will put it aside as emergency backup in case I run out.

This paper is fine for general usage. Unfortunately I had to return it as the paper is a gray in tone / color, not bright white.

I have an HP Office JetPro printer so I thought an HP printer paper would be perfect. Wrong! The paper itself looks lovely, it has a sleek feel and the color is bright, but my HP printer crumples the pages or prints cock-eyed. I think the printer has a hard time grabbing on to the pages so it prints weird.Needless to say these pages make my business look unprofessional.

I thought I was getting more bang for my buck, but this paper clogs and bends throughout the printer.

paper is fine for one sided copies, but jams printer for two sided.

some of the pages had bent edges probably from sliding around in the box during shipping.  needs to be bubble wrapped  to prevent this.  It's too bad because it is a good deal

Looks like item bounced around in package & all 4 corners of paper got bent

This is not what I expected.  It might be 21lb, but not 22lb.

Great quality paper, multi use.  However, if you have a BJ's club membership you can get the EXACTLY same product - quality & quantity for $6.99!

I was using a more expensive, slightly heavier printer paper but now that I have this I'll never switch. This is perfectly acceptable... white, prints well, good weight and the price is exceptional.

I always buy this pack of paper on Amazon for myself which lasts a good amount of time even with all the printing I do for my business and each year I also buy this for kids school supplies lists. The schools usually ask for 2 reams of paper for each of my kids grades and this is the absolute best value for the amount of paper you get. It’s all in one paper and prints very nicely for everything I’ve ever printed. Never had a problem or complaint about it. Came smooth and undamaged. Doesn’t wrinkle very easily with normal handling. Has never jammed in my printer. It’s a nice white color not dull. I definitely recommend this buy. Whyj not? You get basically a MEGA ream for the price of a regular size ream of paper. No brainer to me!

Spent just a bit more for this paper than the normal “base” grade and it’s well worth it. Nice, bright white and there’s a noticeably higher quality feel to the paper. Very pleased.

No issues with this paper and best price ever! I'll be buying this from now on.

Great paper and good savings for this paper.

Excellent printer paperThicker than most paper with no bleed through.Excellent durability and works great with highlighters.No paper jams with Pixma printer.Bought another reem after my first print run.I hope this helps.Happy shopping

I needed paper asap, placed an order, and was pleased that Amazon could deliver it the next day!  How convenient to have such super service. The paper itself is of great quality, at a reasonable price, for my needs and makes beautiful, clear copies. I like that it is a lighter weight and there are 750 sheets of it in a package.

Good price, quality and bright white paper.  We always like HP paper.

This package is what everyone should get the price is great if you use your computer to print your work or something else this paper will come in handy some printing paper only cares about 100 or two hundreds pages but this packages comes with about 750 sheets to copy. I will be getting  this item again. It worth every penny.

I do a newsletter for a club I belong to, and finding good quality typing/printing paper at a good price is always something I'm looking for.  I used to buy a package of paper at Walmart in this size - a ream and a half.  After using that size package, it just seems that a regular ream is just too small, and I'm shopping more often that I want to.  Finding this package of quality paper at Amazon does the trick.  Good quality paper and the price is right.  And, it gets delivered to my door!  Can't beat it.

The paper was atop several items. 2 of the 3 paper bundles were still intact, but one was open and some of the page spilled.

Because 22 lb paper is more substantial than the usual 20 lb type, it looks more present and somehow more professional.Yet, I find that I have to hand feed each sheet of this HP 22 lb paper to my HP printer because the printer fails to grab paper on its own if it isn’t 20 lb paper.So while both are always easy to find I’ll probably continue to buy HP paper long after moving on to a better brand of printer.

Printing from an Epson 15000 ET printer was not good. Printout was a saturation of ink, bleeding through the paper. print seems to be okay, unsurprisingly, when using my laser printer but the printing via inkjet is not recommended.

The products and the shipping boxes were received without damage. However I specified for the packages to be delivered at the back door. I have a white table with fedex/ups deliveries sign on the white table at my back door. Instead of walking up to the back door, the delivery person placed both boxes on the ground behind my vehicle and it has been raining for 2 days. There was no plastic bag or anything around the boxes to keep them from being soaked. Very disappointed and delivery.

The delivery was great . However my paper was a little damaged. No bueno

I like the size and the brightness of the paper. But I'm not sure if everything was intact because the pack was already opened when I received it. I didn't want to return because I needed to use the papers. I don't know if it's by default or coincidence because I saw some reviews about the same (pack being open). It's like the item is returned and they deliver it to another in the same condition! I mean, why should one deliver an already open package?

Great product, crappy packaging.  I pulled the package out of the box it came in, started to cut the paper off the box, and discovered there is no box!  The plastic wrapping IS the box. That's the reason I only give this product 3 stars.

Came with ink in a corner of about 1/5th of the sheets. See photo. I did not open it till months after it arrived so I can't send it back.  HP should be able to do better than that.

These paper is just ok. Nothing special. Not bad, not great either. Typical middle of the road quality.

It's ok. It seems to work fine in the printer. Doesn't jam. The paper creases and wrinkles very easily. But for what I need it for, it's fine.

I like the product but ordering one ream caused it to damaged in the box. The air bags were only on one side so the other side had damaged paper and the cellophane was ripped.

I like the quality, weight, and brightness for everyday use. The price is a little too high though.

Amazon packing sucks received in box all ripped open

The paper is decent quality and works fine in my printer, but it arrived with about 50 sheets in the ream badly bent in one corner so I can't use except for scrap paper.  For paper at this cost I would have expected better.  I have never had a ream of paper where the outside packaging looks fine and when it is opened a tenth of the paper is damaged.

Paper seems fine, some not useable for printer due to creases.

Was an ok paper.

The media could not be loaded.
                



When I received it my paper was open. Idk if someone ordered it opened it and returned it or what. I never thought this would happen. If I’m buying something new I’m expecting it to be in the closed package.

The quality of this paper is similar to the cheap paper you find at Office Depot.It's quite thin and bleeds through a bit.Due to thinness, it wrinkles easily and rips easily as well.I think there are better options to be found at this price point.

Would have given this a 5 but not cheap.

A good economical purchase from this site.

Good quality/price and works well for laser printing. I don't have an inkjet or color so can't comment on that. I would buy this again.

Just as described but could have been a little less costly.

Similar to say glass, I'm not well versed in telling the difference between different "qualities" of standard things. Like HP paper? You're telling me there is that big of a difference?Well guess what, I may have fell for the marketing trap and bought some HP paper. But you know what?! It wasn't that expensive and HP printers are notorious for being a headache. Especially the print cartridge ones, no thank you. So buy the brand, and it may treat you nice.But I have a laser printer, and this paper does great with it. I print out a bunch of different sheets for my business, and the ink comes out very clear and the saturation is nice. If you're like me and nervous to try Amazon Basics in fear your printer may detect it's a fraud, get this stuff. Plus, 750 sheets is going to outlive me!

Have ordered this printer paper before. I don't expect any problems. A significant section of the outer wrapping arrived TORN. All the paper inside "appeared" to be intact. Deducted one star because of the ripped packaging.

What can I say..... it's paper, and what can you expect from paper other than being paper  and behaving like paper lol.

Pens work great love all the colors. Was scared they would be damaged because they put the pens in a box with a 750 pg reem of paper so the pen plastic box got obliterated. Has to toss that part but other than that the pens are worth it if your looking for a colorful cheap gel pen option.

I have a multi function ink Jed and am happy with the quality

Got this item at a solid price and was happy with the quantity. Only issue is that the paper itself is much thinner and more easily wrinkled than I expected at this weight.

Good value. More paper than most packages. For everyday use I see nothing wrong with the quality. Showed up when it was supposed to.

Nice weight and brightness.

Good quality paper and price reflects the quality

Great value for the price.Quality of paper is good.

good product

now that's some good copy paper I can said that it's not thick paper or thin paper I will say it's in-between and the color is pure white it's a good buy.

good

Great value

Delivered on time and worked great in my printer.

Good paper, great price. Happy with my purchase.

Works great for kids art and drawing

Ordered because I was in a bind and needed copy paper quickly.  The price was reasonable and the paper has a nice weight and feel to it.

I would have given it a full 5 Star if the package haven’t been torn during shipment. Although, the paper itself didn’t get damage (well maybe one or two pages got wrinkled).But the paper is really good. 22 lb at $8.87 ($0.0118 per page) is really not bad. And as Prime member not even shipping cost. Can hardly beat that.

Nice paper despite the HP brand name.

I am glad to see that Amazon carries printing paper to purchase aside from purchasing it from other places, such as Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, etc., as well.

will order again from this client!

It’s printing paper, just some stores is more than others!

Paper seems to do what it’s supposed to do. Good pricing.

I got a good price on it, and it was delivered speedily via prime. What more can you ask?

over priced . but works fine

Paper is OK but kinda thin my printer almost ruffles it

It's a good value. What else can I say: it's printer paper????

Paper looks so good and nice

Too thin for my liking. Decent price point though.

It’s a great Printer Paper.

Great quality bright white paper.

Ok

A lot of quality paper

It's becoming hard to find quality printer and copy paper that isn't extra super whiter than white paper that has that weird blueish tinge to it from the optical whiteners, but this paper fit the bill.It's not for super high quality prints, but it's still a nice paper for everyday use.

I've never seen this much paper for this price! It is very white and not too thin. It works perfectly in my Color Laser printer as well as my Inkjet. Can't go wrong with this!

When this first arrived, I couldn't believe how heavy it was. What a huge ream and a half of paper! It works perfect in my laser printer / copier and is an excellent bargain. I will buy this again when I get low.

I had run out of printer paper and didn’t have time to run out and get some so I decided to order this it came very quickly and it’s a really good grade of paper I will definitely buy it again when I get low on paper

Perfect paper and it fits the printer. My printer is weird because sometimes it doesn’t accept the other paper but this one.

This is my favorite paper to purchase on Amazon! It’s always low cost and it’s the smoothest silkiest paper ever! Even if you don’t own an HP printer if get this paper!!

Excellent price for this amount of paper

A GOOD HEAVY, BRIGHT, ALL PURPOSE PAPER.  WORKS WELL WITH MY HP LASER OR MY EPSON INK-JET.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PAPER TO ANYONE FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Like most people, I believe in recycling but recycled paper is usually much more expensive then regular paper, and since I'm currently on a fixed income, I have to look for the best deal on Amazon when buying paper.  And I believe this is the best deal on paper on Amazon.  It works great in both inkjet and laser printers.

Great stack of papers and not thin.

It’s honestly just good paper. Doesn’t jam or have wrinkles. Would buy again.

Perfect for my needs

Great paper and price

I buy this paper on Amazon all the time.  It is a great price for the 750 sheet pack and I can get it in 2-days.  The quality is great.

Nice and bright.

good product

Good price

This package will last me a year or more, I like the quantity. It's nice, white and rectangular. Just what the doctor ordered!

Top notch paper from HP! Was on sale for the same price as lesser quantity paper rims.

good quality

Good price

It's paper, no ifs ands or buts about it. No issues with it like it getting jammed or bleeding through either.

Excellent HP printing paper & a very low price.  Buy now.  Print tonight.

good for inkjet printers

Just what I ordered

This is my second purchase of this 22lb paper, and it has become my favorite.

Best printer paper I've ever used. Slight gloss.It's even pretty good for photos.

Still using them

Paper works great in my copier.

As a homeschool mom I purchase a lot of our curriculum in digital format to print myself and this paper runs smoothly through my Epson EcoTank Printer.

Excellent value for the money!

Regular paper. A better quality but not for brichures

Good price when I purchased it. Good quality

I like it. The quality is very good. Will order it again.

This is the only paper my expensive printer likes.  Does not cause problems.  Great stuff.

Best price out there getting a Pack & then a Half of extra paper.

Paper texture was great.  Price very good for HP brand.

Good quality for printer. 750 sheets for this price is a very good deal with Prime free shipping.

Less expensive, good quality and I got it the next day!  Win Win!Thank you

Good purchase.

Paper is clean and unmarked, with a good weight.  Best paper found so far.

The packaging appeared to be fine, but when I opened the ream of paper one corner of every page was bent and crinkled. The farther into the pack I went, the worse it got. I needed the paper right away and it was already opened, so I was not able to return it. Otherwise, the quality of the paper is fine.

Hammermill makes great paper, but the condition I got mine was bad. The outside packaging was intact, but the normal store packaging was torn open on 3 sides and the paper appears to have fallen out and been stuffed back in. I'd say about 25% is good enough for presentation and at least 70% can still make it through a printer.I needed to use the paper right away so I didn't bother doing a return (and for the cost of the paper it is not worth the hassle). I'm not sure if this kind of thing happens enough to warrant better packaging but it is enough to make me try a different store/brand next time, or possibly even get off the couch and visit a retail store.

One of the two reams I've open so far has wrinkled pages throughout the ream (wrinkled across the page, not edges so it is not a shipping problem). I have been buying the Hammermill laser print 24 lb paper (the one with the butterfly on the wrapping) for 3 years and have never had that issue. I decided to switch to try another 24lb paper to see if it would take the ink better from my printer, and the quality of the multipurpose 24lb paper is much lower (although so is the price, so maybe I should have expected that). It's also much brighter white and more textured than the laser print paper, which is very smooth. The texture change doesn't surprise me, as I was hoping that would help with printing a but it didn't make much difference, and just feels cheaper.

I have ordered alot of paper & this is the worst ever. Not very white & I feel it is "cheap" feeling & cheap look.Because I had to open it, I imagine I cannot return it. I am very very disappointed

I compared this to the 22lb paper I use at work and this stuff is way more flimsy and thin, just like the cheap 20lb paper I get generic at Walmart!! Don't purchase, it is a scam!!!

I've purchased this paper before and really liked the quality. For "standard" paper it has a weight and 'whiteness' that I appreciate.That said, as other reviews have pointed out, you can no longer count on Amazon to ship this item properly. They will put it in a soft envelope that will then be tossed all over the place until the manufacturer packaging explodes and all of the paper wrinkles and tears.Amazon does refund when it's destroyed like that, but it all feels useless and wasteful, knowing a reorder may result in the same thing.

Color is a dull white. It seems that the print from my laser printer needs to dry before I fold my letters into an envelope for sending, otherwise the print comes off onto the paper that folds over the printed side. Bummer. Inexpensive which is the only good thing here.

The paper itself is great but my first ream had the corners of the paper bent so I ordered an exchange and the second ream was bent even worse, managed to salvage between the two packs about 90%  good sheets. This damage must have happened prior to shipping because neither shipping box was damaged, very frustrating because the paper prints great I’ll just have to find a different source for it.

The paper bleeds inks causing images to be fuzzy.

I ordered 2 reams. They came poorly packaged and one ream had one corner crushed and was unusable in a printer as it would not feed. This is totally the fault of Amazon. The paper itself is some of the best printer paper I have used and recommend it. Just go buy it from a company that will ship it correctly or go into a store.

I ordered this in January and loved the product because of quality. I reordered it for my business and the quality is same as Amazon basic 20lb copy paper. What happened?!!! I compared the remaining papers I have from my first order, TOTALLY DIFFERENT PAPERS!!!

I got this to use for my teacher planner. I needed paper that was a little thicker than 20lb but would still fit in my printer. I purchased a 24lb from target but when it ran out turned to amazon. In comparison, it is just as thin as my 20lb regular paper. I'm disappointed and will be trying a different brand.

Paper too thick for my laser printer and it is an HP printer. I kept having paper jams I never had before.Nasty paper.Went back to all purpose

I have a few other brands of paper I have used with same weight and similar finish. This one jams 7out of 10 times I try to print on a laser printer. Tossed one of the other brands in and it prints flawlessly.

Package was opened, looks like paper was used.

I'm a leather worker. I order my letter patterns online. They are almost always designed to be printed on A4 paper. I use A4 paper which is almost the same as 8.5x11 paper but it is not the same! Getting a standard, 8.5x11 paper does no good. I might as well turn this into firelighters for all the good it will do me.

This paper is terrible for my laser printer.  It looks messy, has holes in print and smears off.

The paper clumps together and constantly jams my printer. Or pulls multiple pages through at the same time. I’m so disappointed and wish I could return it. I haven’t had this issue with any other paper but it is consistently happening with this paper unfortunately. It’s really challenging and frustrating. Sadly, I wouldn’t purchase again.

Price vs actual product was not premium by any means. To thin,and should not be considered premium. Very misleading.

From the text on the offer I assumed this would be great quality for my color copies. WRONG!.  it is very poor quality for color copies.  It is OK for black print.Don't buy this paperl

Didn't realize it as I just opened it, so too late to return, but I don't like paying for something that is damaged.Of course may be the shipper, the paper is fine.

I was unable to use more than half of the sheets because of ding and dent damage during shipping.

I will not purchase again.  Wrinkled paper in both reams.  I thought maybe the first was just a bad batch.  Second was just as bad.  Makes a terrible statement for my business.

I wasted my money on this. Not good quality. You would expect better from Hammermill.

I doubt myself whether I'll ever use it.  It came bended and I prefer to keep my printer trouble free.

Arrived with smashed corner. I won't be purchasing this again.

This paper consistently jams my HP 1200 LaserJet printer, unlike similar weight and finish papers.

It’s not the hard paper I usually use so pictures are not the quality I expect.

I ordered four reams. Three were damaged with one corner looking scraped and almost torn. The box doesn't look damaged, so I'm thinking it was damaged before being placed in the box. Not worth the hassle of returning, but this Prime member is disgusted.

Poor quality

Did not work well for color printing with inkjet printer

Jams my brand new HP Laser printer every time. Totally useless and have not been able to print a single page. Don’t waste your money.

Hammermill box damaged and 1/2 packet of paper damaged beyond use.  Amazom box was fine so this was not done in shipment.  Very disappointing!

My cheap, regular, copy paper is brighter than this paper.

the paper is so soft and thin. not recommend for color printing. also cause banding.

Paper arrived with dark spots all over most of the sheets. I'll never buy Hammermill products again.

This paper was advertised a certain number and pieces. Both were lies. There are better deals w/o the lies.

The paper is too thin, it is not very good, we will not purchase next time

Garbage this won’t even print it keeps jamming in my printer … never again do not buy this!

papers are not clear , many lines are in paper

I have used various brands of paper with my laser printer. This is the most expensive one and the only one that jams, and for multiple times. What more do I need to say?

2500 sheets of letter Paper and was not wrapped correctly. The corners on each package were damaged.

I bought this because of all the reviews saying this was a heavyweight paper with a nice thickness to it and I needed something nicer to print programs. But this is exactly the same as the crate of Amazon basic paper I have already. So if you're looking for thicker paper, this is NOT it.

I bought this looking for quality paper for my laser printer. First time using the paper, it curled around my upper fuser roller so tight I had to use a razor blade to cut it off the roller. Yes, I sliced the Fuser roller, yes I ruined my laser printer for future "clean" prints (my bad). The quality of the paper doesn't appear to print any better than my Amazon brand copy paper I bought in bulk from Amazon. I won't purchase again and I do not recommend.

I have used this paper for many years with no issues. The most recent ream I received jams on nearly every print job. The consistency of paper thickness within this ream seems off. Additionally, the paper comes with a 99% jam free guarantee which is hollow as there is no mechanism for me to be able report my jam issue via Amazon or Hammermill. Disappointing. I may try another ream but if it is not substantially better, they will lose me as a customer.

I am a homeschool mom and community director. I print numerous documents each week. This paper is substandard even though it is rated at 24lbs. I can see thru it in a side by side comparison with OD 24lb. paper. It is now scratch paper. This purchase was a waste since I cannot use it for its intended purpose.

Paper does not work in an Inkjet printer.  Tray pulls multiple pages while other brands do not.

Nothing like the quality of Hammermill Printer Paper, Premium Laser Print 24 lb, 8.5 x 11-1 Ream (500 Sheets) - 98 Bright, Made in the USA, 104604R.JamsDull lookingNooo thanks.

Paper jams on double sided repeatedly. I changed to a different brand (Staples) and have no issues. I have ordered this paper numerous times in the past. It has usually been a good product.My machine requires 24lb paper for the best performance. However, on this last box the new rookie AMAZON delivery person left the box at the back of building near the office in the rain. I am assuming that is to a good part of the issues. But I could be wrong.I can sometimes get a run of 20 pages double-side with Hammermill and then it goes into repeated jams. I had the coping machine serviced and cleaned and this paper still continues to jam where the other does not.

This paper is too thick , you can use it as carving board...

This will make my shredder work harder.  This is not an everyday weight of paper.  If you want thick, then this is for you.

The paper is nice, but it constantly jams my ink jet printer.  Took me an hour to print 10 pages because I kept having to unjam it, and then I just gave up.  Very frustrating.

I bought this for our Cannon Pixma, based on the reviews that it can achieve "deep black" and "vibrant colors" which sounded ideal for quick print graphic proofs.It did not meet those descriptions. The ink created the soggy look (not unexpected) of too much ink after a regular print. The blacks were instead dark gray just like other regular papers I have tried. This one however proved even worse, as the paper has a texture to it that shows through the print as white noise. A print on Epson Bright White (https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Bright-8-5x11-Inches-S041586/dp/B00005MJS0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474493927&sr=8-1&keywords=epson+bright+white+paper+500+sheets) is also gray, but it doesnt have the additional noise that ruins the prestine quality of print graphics.My search continues for a good inkjet paper that can achieve black rather than dark gray.

The print quality is very good, it feels smooth and moves easily through my printer when duplexing. However in comparing it to my previous brand's paper with exactly the same specs, (1) it is not as white, having a definite cream tint and (2) it is noticeably lighter than the previous 24# paper I was using. Since I was careful to select a paper with the same specs as the paper I had before, I'm disappointed in my purchase.

The plastic band was so tight around the box that two (2) of the paper reams on top (under box lid) were squeezed so tight the paper was warped.  I pulled out all reams and placed the 2-bad reams on bottom of box and placed good reams on top of them.  My hope is the ream weight will press with warped ream paper to become more flat.  Only time will tell.

The package arrived with the Hammermill cover split open and several sheets of paper were bent and dirty.  It looks like it was sealed broken apart in the shipping envelope.  Unfortunately I had to use this paper immediately and I had no choice but to sort the bad sheets and toss them at my expense.

“Premium ink jet paper?”  No way. This paper is too thin. Even when I put the printer on draft mode, the ink leaks through the other side. Two-sided printing is impossible, as both sides look terrible. I am shipping these junk papers back.

This paper ream appears to have been damaged long before shipping. The corners are permanently folded over….like there’s no way to get the paper to be flat. It was cheap…so I guess the old adage of “you get what you pay for is true” in this situation.

It is what it is, but even that was a little disappointing in brightness and quality.

Too thick ( heavy) for most work

Almost everything was exactly as it should be for printer paper. However, 50 or so pages were dented, crinkled, and curled in two corners. 50 out of 500 seems like a very small amount and it is but that's 10% of the paper almost unusable right out of the proverbial box.

using for envelopes and discovering that every 6th sheet is puckered like it has had water damage.  Odd that the whole pack isn't damaged - almost like they've purposely been hidden in the stack.  else, the 24lb works great for envelopes.

seems lighter than 24 pound, curls up in the tray after printing

The Forest Stewardship Council shouldn't approve this product when it's wrapped in plastic.

I read so many positive reviews that I decided to buy this paper. I have a translation company, and I use a variety of high-quality paper at work. So far, this has been the worst I bought. It feels cheap, it's see-through, some pages are dirty, smeared (not caused by the printer).

There is nothing premium about this paper. Compared to other high-quality paper brands, this is much more rough, less bright, and simply lower quality

Opened box to find one ream too bent to use in printer due to jamming from major crease in paper.

The print quality on my inkjet isn't that great. Big mistake purchasing this.

I really don't get it.  This paper is jamming all my printers.  Very unhappy.

Cheap. One of them does not work with IPhone or IPad. An error message shows up and says not compatible device. The other does this occasionally.

Just started using this paper and it is substandard compared to Staples brand.

Mediocre @ best

box and paper damaged.

Cheaper products available at Walmart. I expected higher quality for the price.

This paper keeps causing jams in my printer. I never had this problem before.

This is probably the lowest priced inkjet paper on market. But the result is very disappointing. It is absolutely no better than any generic copy paper. It is shameful for Hammermill to market it as inkjet paper.

The Hammermill Printer Paper, Premium Inkjet & Laser Paper 24 Lb, 8.5 x 11 provides a wonderful base for high quality printing. Documents that are able to be printed look fantastic and the weight of the paper is good. However, this paper has caused multiple jams and failure to feed on two separate Canon PIXMA MG3620 inkjet printers. The surface texture seems to give the pickup rollers a problem and this paper will either simply generate a "No Paper" error, or, worse, feed partially before jamming in the printer. I simply can't recommend this paper for Canon PIXMA MG3620 printers.

Nice weight and brightness but gloss is greater than expected. When used with laser printer their are background ink smudges that make the document unsuitable for formal or presentation documents. Have used lighter and less glossy Hammermill paper many times in past but was dissapointed with this product. Have not tried with inkjet yet so can't comment on how well that works. I'm not sure what I will do with the rest of the package.

Good value for money!

I'm just asking for a single layer of bubble wrap around the paper. Or a box that is the correct size. I'll still use this because I hate to waste it, and luckily the damage is not too bad (only about 50-80 sheets or so), but I wish I had just bought it elsewhere.Aside from the shipping, paper is great lol. Nice and sturdy, and plenty bright too.

I'm very disappointed to have paid over $10 to receive this grayish lightweight regular copy paper.  I guess I have to search harder for Hammermill Copy Plus vendors who allow buying only one ream.  I'm disabled so I can't run out to the store, plus I don't own a vehicle.  I was relying on this to be brighter and heavier than regular copy paper which should cost $6 per ream, not $10.  Geez.....

Good

the package was left at the wrong apartment number

I printed out a sheet of a digital color design on a sheet of Hammermill paper and one on a sheet of HP printer paper.  The HP paper had better color saturation and definition.  Another problem is that the corners are crinkled, and that causes paper jams.  I learned my lesson.

I guess I’ve become spoiled because I haven’t had to worry about which side printed first on paper in a long time.  But get it wrong and the paper really curls.  Our HP 4250 fails to feed about every 20 sheets  Yes it’s not a spring chicken but it feeds just fine with paper from Costco or HP paper.  It does do ok in our inkjet.  Ink dries quickly and evenly without bleeding through

Usually, the paper comes in excellent quality. The first box went perfectly; I just got to the second box, and the paper was practically see-through/easily torn. Is this happening to anyone else?

I purchased bc heavier & needed to make slide in name Tags. Weird thing is some sheets felt heavier then others.  On positive side loved it is really a bright white!.

I've been using the paper for many years. Quality is great. And for many years a carton of 5 reams has been about $32. About nine months ago it was about $43. But now it is nearly $60. I get that we have inflation in full swing, but this is a HUGE jump.

looks and feels the same way as normal 2$ paper.

I stock up on paper to ensure I don’t run out at an inconvenient time. Unfortunately, when I was ready to use this paper, I discovered that every sheet had a slightly crinkled corner. Too late to return, so lesson learned is not to buy paper through Amazon unless you’re using it with the return window.

The paper is what I have used before and I assume it will be what I like in a paper again.  I ordered a case so it would be protected by the case box in addition to the shipping box plus I wanted enough paper that I would not run out any time soon.  I'm glad I did because the shipping box was sooooo cheap and crumby that it almost completely fell apart.  Luckly the case box protected the paper.  I did not need a case cutter to break down the shipping box to throw it far away.  It was so cheap that I could tear it like paper with my hands like a piece of paper.  I hope Amazon is not switching to this poor excuse for a box.  If they switch, I'll have to reconsider ordering anything from them again.

The paper quality is nice but why would this product get high environmental marks when the outer packaging is plastic?

The paper is printing fine and I like it. But the two bundles I ordered arrived in a large box sliding around and they damaged some fragile items in the box. And there was no packing material to prevent this

The paper arrived timely, but the corner was bent on many of the sheets.  I kept the paper but should get a refund for 100 sheets which were bent.

To reorder this product I now have to pay over 11.00, and my first order was 9.99.  Why on earth would I EVER order this again from Amazon?  I've found this to be true on so many items that I've ordered in February 2020, and now there are no "good deals" anymore.  I have been ordering from Amazon for convenience, rather than the good pricing I've received in the past.  PRIME CUSTOMER

This paper would be fine for just everyday printing of non-business documents and the ink quality against the paper came out great.  However, for high volume documents, sheets stick together and hard to separate when sorting.  Value for the money.... again, fine for non-business needs and low volume printing.

The paper if good quality. But the packaging was horrible. A few sheets damaged.

This review relates only to the packaging/shipping. I haven't tried printing with this paper yet, which looks and feels nice.As others have noted, plastic around paper was ripped open, pages could be missing (I'm not going to count all 500 pages to check). But the shipping packaging did include a bubble-pack envelope around the paper, so the paper itself is not damaged or creased. Hence, three stars.

Product looks great but it arrived partualy damaged on one side and bit squashed and for paper it is marking it presentation and use. Please improve you shipping quality. Thank you.

I really don’t like this paper. It is too thick. Too bad I bought two reams.

weight and brightness is great BUT kept printing with smudges on the header section (pixma inkjet). tried loading all 4 possible feeding directions and still the same. deep cleaned printer inks and under cartridge and still the same with test pages. put a sheet of my 28 lb (which i loved the thickness but hated the glossiness) in between and the smudges were present only on this paper. can't blame the printer if my in between test page of the old paper came out clean. had to be the paper and not the printer. maybe just this production batch?

Not the premium quality expected. Returned with no problems.

The paper is too thick/heavy. Keeps jamming up my printer feeder.

If the level of paper in the tray gets below a certain limit, the printer will take multiple pieces of paper.  I didn't have this problems with other brands of paper. I have enough messed up pages to use for note so they won't be totally wasted.

Good deal for what you pay for

This is good for normal printing. Not recommended for business brochures. and certainly not for double side printing. it is not as thick as I thought it would be. not good enough for inkjet printer (although it says "premium inkjet & laser"). price is good but I would not recommend this to anyone. if you are in need of a good printing paper for normal use and limited to 1 page printing, go ahead.

I needed to do some two-sided printing so researched which paper to use. This brand and weight was highly recommended so I bought a case. After printing several thousand sheets, I don't recommend it for two sided printing as there is too much bleed-through to suit me. On the plus side, it's the first paper I've used that doesn't seem to ever jam!

This paper sticks together when the printer grabs it and then I end up with the first inch of my page printed on one sheet and the rest of the page printed on the next.  Really frustrating for large print jobs.

I was a bit disappointed in that even though this paper is rated at 24# and 97 Bright it 'seems' to have a slight purple tint to the paper. The flower color, I suppose? I am comparing this to the Hammermill Laser Print (#104604) that is rated at 24# and 98 Bright. There is only a factor of (1) in the Bright scale and one states 'Ink & Laser' and the other states 'Laser Print.'

This paper does have a very faint lavender hue as another reviewer mentioned. I doubt it would be noticeable if I wasn't directly comparing it to other pieces of white paper. Compared to my last ream of 24lb copy paper (Xerox Bold), this has a mottled, uneven appearance and is not as smooth.

Price was too high.

I was hoping it wouldn’t bleed through but my cricut pens did. Haven’t tested with ink pen yet. Very bright. It is definitely a step above regular copy paper. Looks great in my custom journals.

I would not recommend this kind of paper for good quality for keepsake or for file.  So I will not buy this kind of paper again.

Unlike other paper I bought previously this batch jammed my laser printer.

This is fairly decent paper for the price, but it has no inkjet coating despite being marketed as "ColorLok". It just looks like ordinary office paper.

Really fast delivery!  Pages in one ream damaged before shipping and unusable.  Other than that, very good paper!

Paper still jams in printer, particularly when I try to do more than one duplex copy.

Yup it's paper

I actually thought I order 28 lb not 24 lb. My fault but still usable.

If you intend to make notes or throwaway printout using 24 pound paper is a waste.

think i paid too much

Great paper quality.

Arrived on time.  Handling of the package left dog ears at opposing corners for all sheets.  Fortunately still usable, i.e. it didn't jam in the printer, but may not purchase printer paper again in the fashion.

nothing wrong except I can get cheaper elsewhere

Was very strong paper

Thin paper but just fine for a high school and middle school student who print frequently

WHY IS PAPER THE COST OF GOLD

I wanted paper that would not show through when printed on both sides. This comes close but not good enough. I will try something a little heaver next time.

I’ve been using Hammermill Premium Inkjet & Laser Paper, and I’m incredibly impressed. The 24 lb weight gives a sturdy feel, and the 97 brightness makes text and images pop off the page. It's perfect for both inkjet and laser printing—no smudging or bleeding! Plus, it's made in the USA, which I love. The quality is consistent, and the price is great for 500 sheets. Highly recommend!

this is the second ream i have bought for home use.  The weight of the paper is impressive, and the smooth surface is very nice to the touch.  All print is very clear...

Has a nice thickness to it. You can tell it’s high quality when you hold it. Much better than typical copy machine paper. Looks better from kids school work and when printing out listings for real estate clients. Worth the cost.

I like weight and color quality (white). I have used this product a number of times, never have had problems with it jamming in my printer. I like that reading printed pages is easy on my eyes. No glare.Great product!

Not cheapest but decent quality, printer has no issues with it.

High quality paper that is thick and bright.Almost too good for everyday use, but why not pamper yourself and use the good stuff for everyday.Thats what I do.

Good paper for everyday printing.  Nice weight and feel to the paper.  Plan on enjoying this paper over the next few months on my new Canon printer.

In the last year I've bought two of these. My wife prints hymn lyrics for church, notes, documents on this paper. It's nice paper, substantial weight, great coloring.

I used to buy cheap and thin printer paper, and it was embarrassing to hand someone something I printed. I decided to buy heavier paper, and now my I feel empowered when hand people my printouts. Will this paper change your life like it did mine? Maybe not, but you will never know unless you try it.

Great quality. Definitely recommend for purposes for which you want more than the regular flimsy and easily crumpled light weight paper. Instead, this paper is a bit sturdier and you can both feel and see a big difference. Great for things like double-sided color printing or printing a physical copy of a resume that you’re giving to prospective employers or recruiters.

Like the paper , somewhere along the way one corner of package was dropped or something. Papers have a small dog ear but works ok.

I actually came here to gripe about the slow shipping time and saw so much confusion that I decided to educate instead.  Nothing about the "lb" number means not "see-through" or the level of quality.  White will often have a blue tinge to it because in some cases it can make it appear "brighter"; if you do not want your paper to have a blue tinge, you need to look for "warm white", and you will be paying a bit more for it and it won't be bright.  I could sit here typing out the difference between 20, 24, 26, 32lb, etc., but I cba so at the end of this rant I'll be posting a link for everyone to educate themselves.  If you want a paper that won't show the print on the other side when you hold it up to the light, I suggest a sheet of plywood.  Flyers are generally 20-24lb, and if you think you're going to fool everybody by printing your flyers on what is essentially poster-board, even card stock will have show-through (not "see-through"; paper isn't transparent and even vellum is translucent at best) when held up to light.  Generally speaking, for anything from class papers to flyers, 20-24lb is fine and anything higher is pretentious.  If you're doing a presentation that you need to impress someone with, use 28 or, if you must, 32. If you *want* thick flyers even though people are just going to throw them away, get some card stock - and if you're printing them at home, check that your printer can handle the paper first.  Hammermill is one of the best-known, good-quality brands in the United States.  For sure you can't go wrong with this.  I also recommend Xerox brand if you can get it at a good price.  Please stop thinking that because you've ordered paper a whopping 4lb greater than the standard 20lb that you should be able to use it to block out the sun.  It's perfectly good as printing paper, but it is not much more than that.  Have a good day, everyone, and here's the link I promised if you *really* want to be confused about what that little "lb" means: [...]

Doesn't jam and prints well. I have used these for quite some time with no problems.

Nice quality. Sharp white color. Proper thickness.

Received in good condition IT'S Paper

The paper printed well.

As I feared, three corners (out of eight) were crumpled. Not a good way to buy computer paper. Sigh.

Paper was as ordered. Shipping was an issue once again. Only a day late, but late.

Exactly what I expected from Hammermill. Very good paper for all our needs.

good quality, no jam

I am using an HP Envy 7645 inkjet printer/scanner/copier with an HP inkjet cartridge.I had been using multi-purpose copier paper. Using copier paper, my text documents looked ok, but they were easy to smudge, even days after the documents were printed. In particular, when I would scan the documents I had printed, the roller in the scanner's feeder would often pick up ink off the first page and put a "racing stripe" down the middle of subsequent pages.So I wanted to try this Hammermill inkjet paper to see whether it would reduce smudging and smearing. I am happy to say that the smearing and smudging have been reduced significantly. I no longer get any smudging from my scanner roller, and when handling the documents, it smears only when I go out of my way to rub the ink. The documents are smudge-free under normal handling, even immediately out of the printer.I have also found that the weight of the paper is adequate for double-sided printing. There is no bleed trough at all, though the text from the opposite side is slightly visible. The lettering from the opposite side of the page does not show up at all when the document is scanned or photocopied.

Nice ream!  It reminds me of a movie title I once saw.

The HAMMERMILL paper is great!  AMAZON is equally great and responsive to my online needs!  It is USPS which fails and continues to FALSELY state that it makes delivery attempts on Saturdays, in particular, when I was home, there is an accessible telephone directory directly outside the front GLASS doors of my 13-story building, but the USPS Delivery Personnel are LAZY, do not want to DELIVER or even SHOW UP at the building where the more than 200 tenants go and come at all hours of the day and night!!  USPS has LIED even when I have actually been standing waiting for deliveries, WITH A COMPUTERIZED NOTICE POSTED ON THE GLASS DOOR providing my four-digit ENTRY CODE, and have put into their computer that they could not gain entry at the time when I was WAITING in my residential lobby for them, saw no person, nor a USPS vehicle, or even attempted to call as my Entry Code would have reflected a CALLER ID which is connected to my landline telephone and where a voice message can be left also!!!  FYI!!!

Yes, slightly heavier paper, 24 lb. versus 22 lb. or lighter.  There is a trick for your presentations, if you use a heavier paper, your attendees treat the event and your data with more importance.  I keep a ream or two of 24 lb. paper in my desk at work.  For everyday work, I use the company's paper on the printer.  For MY presentations or hand-outs, I use my own heaver, brighter paper.  Try it, it makes a difference.  You can see it in their faces the moment they pick it up.

It’s paper that is above average!

I'm giving this only 4 stars because I was actually expecting this paper to be a tad thicker than regular copy paper, but it literally feels exactly the same as regular copy paper. If I had WANTED regular copy paper, there are a lot of other packs out there, including by Hammermill, that are much cheaper. However, being this is Hammermill paper, I would not give it less than 4 stars, only because, well, it's Hammermill! If you are looking for good quality paper, this is more than decent, but if you are looking for a thicker than copy paper, 24lb is definitely not the way to go. Try either 28lb or 32lb, whichever is your preference. But 24lb is definitely not suitable for what I wanted it for. The purpose I had wanted this paper for was, I wanted a heavier weight paper to copy adult coloring pictures onto, so that the edges would not curl, as they do with regular copy paper (at least, in my case it does). I have been using cardstock, but feel that is TOO heavy. Ah, well, back to the drawing board I guess.

normal copier printer paper that is just pure basic is usually 20 weight. That type you can easily see through when put up against black lettered documents. With 24 weight, it's not as expensive as ones that feel like thin business card stock but this is thick enough that letters would not easily show and is about the feel of maybe 3 sheets of the lighter stuff. I would use this for stuff like reports in general meetings (not top admin or important business), casual invites, kid's activities that use markers or better prints.

This paper works well for my monochrome laser printer. It’s not super smooth like some laser papers, but it has a good weight to it and is bright enough to look crisp. I would say the paper is professional quality.

I ordered just 1 ream of paper.  It's great paper and works well in my Brother laser.  The problem is Amazon sent the ream in a plastic shipping envelope instead of a box or a sturdy mailer envelope.  By the time I got it, the wrapper around the paper had been torn up pretty bad and the paper was "loose" inside the shipping envelope.  I ended up tossing out about 30 sheets because they were creased/damaged, but was able to salvage the rest of the ream.  I'm using the paper for home use so it's still usable even though the entire ream is a little "scuffed".  Amazon pick/pack needs to do a better job.

It's paper, it works!  They should sell this at Dunder Mifflin!

I'm really loving this paper so far!However it come damaged.It was only the top 20-30 or so pages that the corners were crease, or dog-eared, like the corner hit something hard. ​Not sure if it was a shipping mishap (all the bubble wrap was popped when I got it) or if it happened before and no one noticed. It wasn't a big enough deal to go through the hassle and wait of exchanging it, but it was disappointing.

High Quality Paper is used.

Really pleased with this.  Good feel, not super thin.  Copies look good too.The price is a bit much and that's why I gave it 4 stars, but otherwise, a good purchase

Good product works well, just what I expected

Everything paper should be and have. Ideal for quality prints. I could not ask for better. Great price as well. Only sad remark was that about fifteen sheets on one team were cut about three inches in length.

this paper for me was at a nearly $2 premium over than of other papers with similar features … so while this is a good paper, i’m not sure it’s worth the premium over others of similar qualities.

This is a good quality paper, although, the corners were a little bent during the shipping process.  Amazon needs to secure the paper so that it doesn't slide around in the box, damaging the corners.  Luckily, I don't need to use this paper for professional purposes.

The paper was fine but the reem I received had been cut by a box knife before shipping. I only lost 6 sheets out of 500 and not enough to connect with seller about, but still, I prefer undamaged products.

Just as I expected

Nice weight and brightness, but will at times take 10 ages through for one page print, which causes smearing on the printed page and redos needed. This has happened 4-5 times in the last 20 prints.

Received my package opened and un sealed. Not sure if seller or fba’s fault. Prints okay. Someone got to fix logistics though.

It is noticably thicker and stiff compared to other papers I am given in offices.

A little on the thick side and tends to jam up my printer

Everything is getting more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  This is a very good paper.  24 lb is much better, and noticeably thicker, than generic 20 lb copy paper.  Good deal.

Great paper and not flimsy at all. No worries here.

Fairly thick paper stock. Agrees with my Epson printer- no printer head striking and no smearing.

I save this copy paper for important paper, because the quality is good.

This paper is paper. It functions like paper, looks like paper, smells like paper, and feels like paper. I have not tasted it yet, though. I'll update my review after I do.

24 lb. paper is better for double-sided printing than 20 lb. paper because the image on the other side doesn't show through as much.  However, it does show through to some extent.  If you want paper that doesn't show anything from the other side, you'll have to go heavier than 24 lbs.  This Hammermill paper is the first 24 lb. paper I have purchased, so I don't know whether it hides the image from the other side better or worse than other brands.  All I can say is that it is better in this regard than 20 lb. paper.

I just needed some inexpensive paper, the quality is just fine, no complaints. It’s copier paper, nothing to write home about

What more can you say about paper?  The brightness and thickness is as expected.

Delivered to wrong address.  The next day my neighbor brought it to my house

This paper just feels better (thicker) than other paper. Also the it's a nice bright white. When I provide prints to a client, many notice that it feels nicer than what they are used to.

Great Paper and looks great with my Epson Printer

Some paper that says for inkjet and laser printers are better with the laser printer then the other as the colors don't really pop out like the expensive for color inkjet printing only paper.  This is a great brand that has produced a great product for those of us that use both types of printers but really only want to use one type of paper for both.  Like that it has the color lock.  I believe that's what makes the color from inkjet printing work so well.  Will be purchasing this every month.  I ran through both printers, ink and laser, about 30 sheets each and so far no jamming of any kind and that was with them printing double sided.  Speaking of which, when printing the double sided on the inkjet looking at it on the table or in a stack there was no bleed through, seeing the other side.  Think I've found my goto for printing.

This great paper. It is a bit thicker paper than most which I love. It holds ink really well. It is just a really high quality paper. I highly recommend. It's the only paper I will use going forwards.

Same as the expectation

I hope I did not jinx myself by saying NO Jams to this point, about 650 pages.  The "white" is bright and the paper's weight/thickness is as advertised.I don't mind paying a little more and having a quality paper.  I hate digging out jams!!!  :-(

Nice thick paper that I will admit to buying because I like the hedgehog on the package

Just right

Gives your printing a bit of a 'fancier' look.

This is the best value in copying paper at Amazon!

I liked the texture of papers.

Works as expected.

I switched to a (Canon) color laser printer from an HP inkjet. This paper (and weight) strikes a good balance between results (printed pages) and cost. Will re-buy when needed.

This si a high quality Hammermill paper and it works great in my paper.

I switched to this kind of paper & it’s just as nice!

I love this bright white paper and the weight. Definitely premium!

Hammermill is a very quality product and I always rely on it for clear, crisp copies.

This is a great printer paper. The pages are thicker. It is nice to have paper available for printed material.

Excellent value.

Bright white, thick 24lb, smooth finish ink jet paper. An excellent quality paper for the price!

Great quality paper & affordable.

Good quality paper.

I have used this paper for years and it is a good weight for important things.  Not thin like copy paper.

This is premium quality paper that is noticeably heavier and thicker than standard printer paper. After switching to this paper, I have experienced no paper jams with my laser printer.

Prompt shipment, price is super compared to local stores that carry it

High quality printer paper. No paper jams at all!!

Nice thick bright white printer paper for documents. Great quality!  Highly recommended.

Just what I needed. Works with my HP color laser.

This is a very nice high-quality paper to use with an ink jet or laser printer. I like that it comes in a two-pack, as I can't lift those huge boxes with many reams of paper. This was perfect.

perfect for the simple uses that I required. thank you

I love the BP products. Works very well for me..

Great paper for photo coping no wrinkles excellent colour holding

Nice thick paper.  Prints and handles well.

I have printed chapters of textbooks, documents, and just about everything else with this paper. It is better quality/thickness than your average cheap 20lb printer paper and you can feel the difference. I’ve tested it using Microns, fountain pen ink, Mildliners (brush tip) and it does not bleed through. I would be cautious of using it with highlighters that tend to be wet/bleed through as it will most likely bleed through with this paper. I tried the Sharpie S Note duo highlighters and it bled through, but it seems to work fine with Mildliner brush tip highlighters (not the regular highlighter bold tips-it will bleed through where you place/lift the highlighter).

I like the quality and weight of this paper. It’s the second time I’ve ordered this brand.

High quality paper

For me this is the right weight and color paper for printing

I was a printer / copier tech for 29 years and advised my clients to use high. Quantity paper for better image quality and less frequent jam 24 lb. Paper is more opaque than 20 so your print is crisper . This very good paper

Exactly as advertised, would buy again.

This item was supposed to be a 3-ream case of HP printer paper. It arrived with only 2 reams in the case. None of the support channels seemed to apply to this issue. I clicked on some buttons which took me to the HP site, which did not supply support options reflecting this issue. So, I did not follow through with that channel. I didn't want to return it because I like the paper and wasn't sure whether a re-purchase would be any better. I'd like a credit for the missing ream.

This is undoubtably the worse printer paper I have ever bought. It constantly jams my laser printer. Almost every sheet fed jams the printer. It makes it impossible to print multiple pages in a reasonable time.

Opened the first ream of a three pack, and half of it is severely dog-eared in one corner. I don't like printing my documents on dog-eared paper so I guess half this ream is wasted or to be used for shopping lists. Hopefully, the other two reams won't be damaged.

This is not quality paper.

I have your basic laser printer.  Figured HP, humm they make laser printers, gotta be a sure bet - wrong.  Maybe it has to do with heating it but the edges of this junk paper curl coming out of the printer (using the picture, imagine what 50 pages would be like).  It’s ok I guess for 1 3 pages if you want to roll what you print against the bend.  This stuff is junk if you’re using it for a laser printer - you were warned

I was looking for a higher quality paper for printing, this paper pack is horrible. It is very thin and when I load it in the printer it bends.

Super thin, can only print on one sideI'll never buy this paper again!

I'm sure the product would have been fine except for the way it arrived.Now I have to lug this mess to Kohl's to return for a refund! Ugh!

The package only contained one ream of paper (500) sheets, as opposed to the the three reams that were advertised.

Ordered 3 reams of 20lb HP, and 1 ream of 32lb HP. The 32lb was OPENED....and one of the 20lb reams was all bent and wrinkled to the point the printer struggles to feed it properly...... LESS than 1 star and how someone decides to mail a client open packaging is beyond me.

I only received one ream of paper. This was a very expensive purchase for just one ream of paper and I'm currently trying to resolve the issue.

Supposed to receive a case with 3 reams, only received 1 ream.

I paid for two and only got 1000 pages

Paper is so thin. I can see from the back what is printed on the front, so forget about double sided printing.I purchased this because i used it before when i bought it from an office supply store. Thick and bright, I'll be only purchasing my paper again from an office supply store.

…this paper quality is as low as we would ever want to go.  Great for the $$ but definitely not for documents.

Good quality and cost

Typical printer paper I always use however the last purchase? Keeps jamming my printer (which is new)and I don't know why? Is it thicker than usual? Not sure but think I'll try a different product next time.

My issue with it is not with Amazon but rather with the manufacturer. I almost every time get a quarter inch of pages which are curled or bent in one corner. I believe it's in the packaging of the product (not the shipping box). I have notified HP of this but  nothing has changed. Thanks. Leon

Affordable paper but jams on occasion.Not for printing items that require a fair amount of ink as it bleeds through. Good for rough drafts and working copies but not for final product.

I like this paper. Prints and feeds well, bright, and good for color printing.However, I  WILL NOT BUY it again due to the plastic packaging which cannot be recycled.Join me in working to eliminate as much plastic as possible from our environment.

Prints fine, hasn't jammed, bright enough. Only negative is it's pretty thin / see though. Will buy heavier weight next time.

Day after I placed some in my printer, the edges curled outward and kept loading a bit crooked when printing. Turned around and next day the paper curled in the opposite direction (outwards).

nice product

Not enough paper for the money.

Several of the pages in the package have wrinkles in them and I have to reprint those pages before sending the printouts to my clients.  Some slacked on their quality control with the batch of paper I received.

This paper is so thin and cheap it jams up in my HP printer....

The paper is great but instead of receiving a three ream case I received one ream. Very disappointed.

I wish I'd ordered a heavier paper, but it will do the job.

I decided to buy this paper because of the price and knew going in that it  was not the brightest, so it wouldn't be the best for presentation-type documents (slides, brochures, pictures, etc.) but OK for copies, everyday printing, etc. About the fifth ream in I noticed that my documents would get jammed when copying when  loaded from the top tray of the computer, double sided copying. This never happened in all the four years I've owned my printer, until then. Then, every time I tried to print from my computer and chose "print on both sides" to save paper, I got paper jams nearly every time. Now I can only print on one side every time, even for documents I need double sided, which will not sustain for long. I've noticed that the paper has a silky feel - maybe an additive on the paper???  and keeps the pages from sticking once outputted from the printer, but inside, something's going on that's sticking as it's processed within it.  Now, I'll have to take my printer into the repair shop to get  tuned up which is a great headache and loss of productivity. I can't say it's the paper 100%, but I won't be ordering this company's paper again - or at least this particular item. I may try a heavier weight and brighter paper if I do.

This was supposed to come with 2 day shipping which means it should have arrived today.However it is now delayed til about Wednesday of next week. 💩So with that being said, it was one of the cheapest options for printer paper.For my house it serves dual purpusesWe use a lot of paper printing things but my kids also craft, draw, paint etc. && this is our most common type of material used for their art.

The box was terribly damaged.  Almost like it had been dropped from quite high.  The paper was in good condition which is what matters.

IF YOU WANT A GOOD PRICE POINT AND EVERY DAY PRINTING, THIS IS GOOD!  I USE IT FOR EVERYDAY PRINTING FROM THE WEB, COPYING, ETC.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR TOP OFFICE /BIG BUSINESS USE!

Works very good in my older HP.  In the newer Canon, the humidity causes it to not load & print multiple pages smoothly, it jams at the first set of rollers before actually printing.  If we take the paper out of the tray put the top 1/2” or so on the bottom it usually works ok.

Prints like supposed to

The paper is fine and looks good whether printing in all black or color. The shipping container isn’t as good because the reams slip around in the box and the corners get beat up. 🙁

I use it for work and my kids use it for their projects

I only printed a trial sheet on a new printer. It seems ok.

It's paper, it works fine.  But its so thin and slippery that sometimes two sheets will feed through and or sheets might get stuck.  It's rare but it happens, and it never happened with other paper I've used.  Yes, using it on an HP printer.  Other than that, it's fine if you don't mind the occasional extra time to clean things up.

Good copy paper. Works very well with Brother laser printers. So far no feeding problems. Bright paper, 20 lb., very white and clean. Prints excellent and clean.

easy to use

This HP 20 lb paper is far better than average quality for an everyday copy paper. However, it used to be under $5 a ream in quantity and now at more than $7, it’s time to reevaluate. The HP All in One 22 is my faves from the company. I reserve it for hard copies that count, such as letter writing or important reports. Lately, I can find that paper (look for the yellow label) at the same price as this one. The 22 is far nicer yet overkill for copies. In general, $7 is too high per ream, even in these inflationary times.

HP packed these three reams inside a very nice cardboard box that was sealed with a strap. However, the reams are packaged in heat-sealed plastic wrap instead of paper. You cannot open these normally - they don't peel open like every other ream does that comes wrapped in paper. You must use some kind of knife to open it - ridiculous. This reason alone made me dock a star from my Overall rating.This is the first time I'm using HP paper on my 8 year old HP M425dn. The paper seems nice enough and at a reasonable price. Having had some issues recently with paper purchased elsewhere, I'm hoping this will correct those infrequent but frustrating times when the printer thinks there is a jam after being cleared. Time will tell.

Good quality paper for all around use.

Paper works fine but is thin. Don’t recommend for work, good for home printing or school stuff. I will note that it’s quality is worth the price. Gotta pay more for better quality.

good

Was looking for quality paper to use in a variety of printers that are picky about feeding paper. This paper works well

Worked well with my laser printer I experience d no problems.

Is just paper but Amazon’s gotten pretty bad they need to step up their game someone’s gonna come and undermined them

This is decent paper, it works in both our home printers, and the price is great.  It isn't presentation-quality paper, but is smooth enough for decent laser and inkjet printing.  I do question whether it's really 96 bright, it seems to be a very very light blue gray color, not snow white like the stuff we use at work.  At half the price, I'm good with this.

Works like any other paper

It's printer paper. It works. I rarely give 5Stars for anything unless it's above and beyond expectations. This is printer paper.

Works as described.  Great value for the price

Good paper at a good price, no complaints.  It's working well in my laser printer, doesn't curl up or cause paper jams.  Having it delivered is always a plus.

so nice to get this delivered to my door, and not have to lugg it up to my apartment.  plus the paper is good quality

it is what it is...knocked off a star cuz it ships with a and tight enough to wrinkle reams just a tad....

Will be ordering some paper soon.

No problems.  Satisfied.

Great price and good quality paper.

Great quality.  Would buy again.

Works.

The free shipping is what really enticed me to make this purchased.  It is a great overall value and a great product!

Good paper for a variety of printers. No jams with this batch, and, remember this is the thinner, 20lb paper that can sometimes jam duplexers, especially older ones. Bleed through is above average but you won't get the effect of 24lb. Would order again. Color is slightly grey but it isn't bad. It certainly isn't "ultra white" unless one of the meanings of "ultra" is "slightly grey." A lot of inexpensive papers are not true white, especially in the 20lb range.

I have purchased several reams of this paper over the years and have noticed that several sheets in each ream are 1/16th inch short of 11 inches.  How can this happen?

Works great with my canon printer.  Less jams which occured with cheaper paper

Great paper for your printer at great price

nice quality paper, has a light glossy feel, its not glossy just has a nice texture, prints well

My printer works well with this paper.No jams feeds nicely.Packaged well will stop paper from taking on dampness.

When you need to buy more printing paper for your home or office, what is the most important fact to remember? Or do you, like so many, just get almost anything that’s “just there?”I’m a longtime travel journalist, and I use and need, lots of paper every month on which to print my articles and color photos.After extensive research-and actual testing and using different papers -it soon became obvious the 2 most important-indeed vital-aspects of buying printer paper are; does the ink bleed through each sheet, and does the paper itself, and this may sound strange, but does it look good and appear to be excellent and yes, top class?I got all the answers to my questions when I purchased HP Printer Paper letter size 8.5 x 11. It’s brighter than most printer and copy paper; it’s great for all B&W printing and, as I do a lot of color printing, the results are always super, with no “bleed” whatsoever. Put another way, the blacks are bolder (and THIS is key) faster drying and the colors are always more vibrant and REALLY colorful.As a journalist I also save a lot of my articles, so I want a paper that does NOT (over time) tend to have that yellowing old look. The HP Multi-Purpose 2O paper is superb, as it IS long lasting in appearance, so my colorful features (pun intended!) keep their original color and look.There’s something on most printer papers that might confuse you, as it did me the first time, and that is when you read the words “Bright” that has a number before it.Briefly put, it means the brighter the paper, the quality and “look” of the overall print job. There’s also (of course!) a “Brightness scale,” and it goes from 0-100. The best number to buy is between 80-10O for real quality prints. For many decades now, I have found that the HP 92 Bright is best of all.It is also a multi-purpose paper.  I order a “3 Ream Case” which totals out at 1500 sheets. Finally, I like - very much - that the paper is made in the USA.

Good value and good quality

A nice printer paper, I've been using HP paper for 5 plus years and very happy with it, the weight is 20 lb and  the prightness is 92. The printing stands out quite well, This paper flows well in  my Cannon MG2522 printer and does not jam, I recommend HP paper for sure

This paper is heavier than I usually get, so it's more stable to work with and to have for long range detention.  I had no problem with lighter weight sheets, but then wasn't familiar with heavier paper.  I'll probably order it again instead of going to drug store for some as in the past.

My son uses this paper for sewing and writing

everything was perfect. thank you for your hard work and dedication to your service.

So far, so good.

I like this one because of been really white. I tried couple of other brands, but they are a little greyish. I like my paper to be bright white, so I went back to HP. I which it could be less expensive.

We've bought this 3-pack before.  We print color photos/documents as well as B & W text.  Great results! No negative comments at all!

Hard to find printer paper for a reasonable price these days.  This is the best I have found.  It’s a bit thin but it works for our needs.

Paper is paper. Came quickly and is nice quality.

This was my first time using HP Printer Paper, and it met all my printing needs effectively. If I need more in the future, I will definitely reorder.

This paper is nice. It doesn't roll up due to the heat from the printer.

What l like about this item is that it's compatible with my printer.

This paper is so awesome.  The feel of the paper is great and I love the printed results.  would buy this paper again for sure.....

My printer loves it. Good quality for a even better price.

its good

It's paper. Not very exciting but often necessary. This package arrived  a few days early & it was in excellent  condition.

Every good.  For school

I used it. No problem

Great paper for a great price

Worked perfectly

Great price and works well :)

Good printer paper. Not too thin.

Good deal for the price

It does what it's supposed to do.  It is just fine for ordinary printing purposes.

To me, paper is paper...I use printer paper for correspondence , print recipes. It works

Great product. Good price and fast shipping.

I'm happy to find this quality paper in a 3-pack that doesn't take up practically a whole shelf in my office.

Great quality paper

It is paper! Has not clogged the printer. That's a good thing.

Love this size box of paper as it’s not so heavy for me to carry in the house

Since my local Office Max closed, I have been ordring printer paper online.  This package is good value, and has given me no problems, even with an old Epson printer that is inclined to fail to load a sheet or load two together.  Thank you, HP!

I like a bright printer paper because I sometimes print photos along with text.  This paper is brighter than the cheapest paper but is still a good value.  It works fine in both of my printers, a Canon inkjet and a Brother laser printer.

great value for your hard earned money

This paper is not flimsy.  It's thick enough for the work.

Good quality and doesn’t jam. Will definitely buy again. I go through a lot of papers.

Won't buy any other copy paper

this is another reorder.  I have this small case handy for my printing projects.  I only print black and white, so this case is perfect.

Very white and not as thin as other copy paper.  Seemingly jam proof too!

What a great price and value on this paper. I use so much it's a great value for me.

I was an engineer for HP paper and ink division. They know their product. Keep it original. I bought this but didn't need it, I found I had another half a case (Full cases have double) not finished, so I stock on the inventory shelf and try not to order when not needed. I ran out of the ream I keep at the printer. DIdn't look at inventory... But this is the good stuff. Different paper for different finished needs. I know my paper. I recommend this for general purpose printing.

I have a HP printer and this paper is a great partner.

It’s been decently good for what we need to use it for at home/work. I’d buy again.

UPDATE: 24hrs later, and nothing. The company was given a fair chance to reach out and correct their mistake and chose not to. They do not stand by the product they are selling you, so do yourselves a favor and avoid buying this.The first time I ordered this, no problems. The second time, disaster. More than half the order had large creases in the paper, some so deep there are holes in the paper. The first pack of 500(that was on top) was fine. The second and third packs, more than half of the paper in them were damaged(I'm just on the 3rd pack now). They have a 30 day return/exchange policy, and there is no way to know of this before that time expires. Unless quality checks are non-existent, I cannot believe that this is not on purpose. Good paper on top, crap paper underneath. I'm a home school with one student. The only way to know that this paper was damaged would have been to open all 3 500 packs of paper, and then have 1500 loose sheets of paper just sitting around.... That's ridiculous. And people ordering this for home use, I would think the same situation would apply to them. By the time you got to the second pack, 30 days will be expired. Amazon cannot help, only send a message to the manufacturer, and then you have to wait for a reply. If they reply and take responsibility for this, I will add that to the review, but for now, do not waste your money on this unless you are willing to quality check 3 packs of 500 sheets of paper all at once. There are some products that this 30 day policy needs to be exempt from, and I feel products like this take full advantage of that policy, knowing they can get away with selling inferior products that cannot be checked within that time.

I received my ordere of HP printer paper cases Box success, However when I opened this box and was VERY SHOCKED to see this TERRIBLE MESSY INSIDE OF ALL PRITNTER PAPER CASES' COVERED WERE TORN OUT ALL OF THEM ! I am not Happy about it. I must send it back ASAP AND REFUND ALL MY PAYMENT BACK ASAP !!! Thanks....

Do not buy this paper if you are going to highlight on it. I have used the same highlighters for years and other printing paper for years and have not had any issues with smudging. When using this paper and highlighters is smudges every time and stained my highlighter.

I bought this paper a while back, but I had to say something because every time I print, the paper is a different size.  And even though it's for personal use, when I staple it the pages are mismatched.Some sheets are 8.5" as claimed, but about every second or third piece of paper is approximately 8.2" or so.  How did that happen?  I will say the brightness is fine, and so is the weight.  I've always considered HP products to be good, but not anymore.  Now I have to decide whether to donate what I have left or finish it.  I think I will donate.  Time to buy another brand.

I would definitely use a different brand.  Decided to buy this as a small personal printer/scanner, but really wish I had gone with a more trustworthy brand.  This all in one is NOT reliable.  The HP Smart software is also unreliable often showing the printer as online, but then when you ask for the scanning, it says the printer is off.  Did some research on this and it appears to be a common HP printer issue with the HP Smart software involved.  I will never buy another HP Printer again and just wanted to give this warning.  Best to go with another brand if you need the printer/scanner to be consistently operational.

This package of paper arrived all tore up on the box it was in and also around the ream of paper. I was not here when it arrived so I did not get any pictures, but if I had I would have been sending it back. Even though the outside of the box was broken, the ream of paper shouldn't have had its covering tore to shreds. It literally looked like someone opened it by mistake then turned around and sold it to me. I was unable to use about 10 pieces of the paper due to damage. Very unimpressed.

The hp wrapping paper was all damaged

My order arrived VERY damaged. The reams weren't even in the original HP boxes. All reams were in one large brown box. My return was accepted, but I'm being expected to pay shipping. I can't even lift this box. Not sure what I'm going to do with all this useless paper and it looks like I'm now out $188.25. I'm not even sure what to think about this. It seems very unreasonable for me to be responsible for sending this heavy box back at my expense.

This the second damaged box I have received. I cannot send the damaged papers through the printer because high risk damage to my printer and the wasting of ink. I will not return these, because I am required to pay return shipping in order to get a refund that makes it not worth it. I am not planning on ordering this paper again.

It's like newspaper quality paper. I would only allow my young children to color on it. Complete junk for professional use! And Amazon will not allow a return because it's not w/in their 60 day return policy despite the fact that there are several packs of paper that would never be used in that time period.

Product is usually fine, but this time the box arrived looking like it had been kicked along the street, taped up, kicked along the street again, and taped up again. It was barely holding the ten reams together, and seven out of ten reams were ripped open. A few pages will be unusable because of wrinkling and bending, but it remains to be seen whether the reams that are opened have been exposed to too much humidity. I was stunned to find a product that was sold and shipped by Amazon to be in such a state.

DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER. I BROKE MY GOOD PRINTER THINKING IT WENT BAD TRYING TO FIX THE PAPER FEED. BOUGHT A NEW PRINTER AND WAS STILL GETTING THE PAPER ERROR. I FIGURED BOTH PRINTER CANNOT BE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES, SO I PUT A DIFFERENT SET OF PAPER IN AND IT PRINTED WITH NO PROBLEM. NOW I WASTED MONEY AND BOUGHT A NEW PRINTER AND BROKE A PERFECTLY GOOD PRINTER WHEN ALL ALONG THE ISSUE WAS THE PAPER. I would never buy paper online again

package of paper came ripped open. I am not sure if I received the full order.

This was opened, returned and creased. All 3 packages of paper. Thanks Jeff!

I assumed putting HP paper in an HP printer was going to be great. Nooope. Since loading this paper a few days ago I have went through half of the ream printing like 10 documents because either it jams or prints uneven using 2-3 pieces of the paper or throws out 6-10 additional pieces of paper printing one document.  Its nice and bright, very smooth and packaging was great so it was like buying a Telsa with a Pinto engine.

Reams are warped and we’re wet at some point. The HP box inside of the shipping box was clearly water damaged at some point.

sent back

I expected to receive the papers with the original labeling like the HP logo and some information about it as pictured such as "92 Bright", etc., but I did not.  There is no way for me to verify the authenticity of the papers, like specs mentioned in the product description as well as where it was made.

Initially, this paper was just like any other.. then, I noticed some pages containing "creases" after printing. Hmm, bad printer? Nope.. seemingly at random, some pages in each ream have these creases.I suspect the reseller got these reams as factory seconds and is passing them off as "grade A".

Low quality paper. Has clear banding (much more visible by eye than in the photo). Basically looks like stripes across the page. And the color / weight does not seem very uniform - there are clear lighter and darker patches. Fine for functional printed documents where you dont care about how it looks, but definitely doesn't feel or look like quality paper.

The reams were all opened the piece of paper all crumpled on the ends and piece were ripped or crumpled.  I will go to staples next time

product was great why amazon attempted to call me at 5:37am is ridiculous, this review is about amazon not my product!!!!!!

I have ordered this product previously. But this order has been terrible. The paper quality is much lower than usual. It is jamming in my printer regularly. I will find a different product in the future.

This paper is low quality.  It feels very light weight & curls as it sits on a flat the counter.  The longer it sits (hours/days), the more it curls.  In contrast the paper I had with the same stats feels thicker & lays flat on a flat counter after printing & stays that way.

Avoid this paper!  My laserjet printer worked at 100% prior to running out of paper.  I purchased this paper and I've not gotten a single print to work as it jams every single time.

My genuine HP printer continues to jam and this has never happened with any other paper I have used before (HP or not) extremely frustrating and complete waste of money. It is a pain in the arse to stop what you are working on to continually fix paper jams. Ink bleeds and smears on this paper.

I order from Amazon because I'm no longer able to carry heavy items up the stairs to my condo.The 3 reams of paper would be fine by itself, but when it's in the same carton as 200 trash bags.....just too heavy to drag inside door by myself.

My printer used to work fine.  I needed to reorder paper and went with this product.  Since installing this paper into my printer, every print job has jammed. I would reccomend buying your paper elsewhere

Bought the 3 pack trusting the HP quality.  However, what was in all three reams was some good paper mixed in with cheap, thin paper!  Obvious different types of paper mixed together.  What a disappointment!  I hope HP does some quality control on this.  I don't think anyone would like to get ripped off this way.

Beside that the box ventured to hell and back before delivering,  surprisingly the box did hold together. Ordered 10 rims, 9 arrived. Paper is extremely thin, I expected more from HP.  Not going to order it again. Im just going to buy it again from store the almost no significant brand name better paper quality cheaper product. I thought paying a bit more, and using the convenience of delivery will make me less busy. Nope.

The outside package was in good shape but the actual paper wrapping was torn (see picture.  It appears it was shipped that waySeveral pages was damages.  I use a proportion that was good for a urgent printing job.It is not worth my time to return it.  Next time it will be office Depot

The ink doesn’t stick to this paper, even after it’s dried. Swiping across with your finger results in smudges and ink transfer to your finger.

We have ordered from this same company several times before. This time, the box looked totally demolished when it came, and the wrapping on the paper was torn. We ordered 10 reams and only received 5. The paper was ok, but we were missing half our order.

Paper was terrible quality!!!! I think this is a joke. This paper is thin, see through. Not what I paid for. I am extremely upset!!! I don’t know they must have sent me paper from the dollar tree!

I think someone returned these and they weren't examined before sending them out again.The individual packages were opened and some of the paper was damaged.

I have not used any of the products, Only the thermometer, wrong color date stamp blue not red ink & very small for my swollen fingers.

Terrible!  Paper is too light and gets caught in the printer.  Every other pages gets caught in printer.

The box of paper was damaged inside the shipping box. What a waste of money!

DONT BOTHER PURCHASING IF YOU LIKE EASY SET UP.  THIS WAS A BEAST.  STILL WON'T CONNECT TO WIFI

Deceiving pictures not a real box of paper a baby box.

To thin almost like trace paper. The positive reviews must be hp bots because no real office person would use this tissue paper. Now i’m stuck with 3 reams of toilet paper.save your money

Super thin and cheap paper.  Pages stick together in printer causing repeated jams and mis-prints.  Always a hassel.  This does not happen with other print paper.  Don't waste your money!

I use three Canon printers for my small business. This paper continually fails to feed through the printers. I have to repeatedly "fluff" the paper stack to minimize print feed errors. I have no complaints about the print quality or the whiteness, but this flaw makes the paper unusable in a small business.

Taking a stack out of the paper should show some nice smooth sides like a book. These pages are so rough and uninformed I can't use them for anything but crafts. Thanks for wasting resources on garbage paper HP.

I've never had  a problem  with paper jamming my HP LaserJet Pro.  I love my printer. This time I decided to take the MFG recommendation to use only HP quality paper and now my printer jams. I will be switching back to Hammermill at my earliest convenience.

paper is very thin and won't go through my scanner. I won't purchase again.

I ordered several reams of this paper because it was a good deal. Now I have to drag 16 pounds of paper to return it.  I will stick to brick and mortar stores for paper in the future.

Installed printer cartridges.  Shut printer door.  The printer started making grinding and popping noises.  It does print but it sounds awful.  Not sure how long the printer is going to last with these cartridges in it.  Would not buy them if I had to make the choice again.

The description says that there are 3 rims but my delivery came only with 2 rims and of different brands. Pls deliver my other missing rim!!!

It is paper.  It fits in the printer.  That's good.The paper was glued to the package, making many sheets unusable in the printer.  That's bad.I won't be buying this again.

As someone who frequently prints documents for both work and personal use, I've tried many different types of printer paper. I recently purchased the 3-ream case of 92 bright, Office 20lb HP Printer Paper, and I'm extremely satisfied with its performance and value.The 92 brightness level of this paper is perfect for producing crisp, clear text and vivid images. I've found that it consistently delivers professional-quality results, regardless of whether I'm printing a simple letter or a full-color presentation. The smooth finish prevents ink smearing and bleeding, ensuring clean and sharp prints every time.The 20lb weight strikes the ideal balance between durability and affordability. This paper is sturdy enough to hold up to frequent handling, yet not so thick that it becomes cumbersome or expensive. It feeds smoothly through my printer, eliminating the frustration of jams or misfeeds.The 3-ream case provides an excellent value, offering a generous quantity of paper at a competitive price. As a bonus, the case is easy to store and keeps the paper protected from dust and damage until it's needed.Moreover, I appreciate that HP is an environmentally responsible brand, as this paper is sourced from responsibly managed forests and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This gives me peace of mind knowing that my paper choice supports sustainable forestry practices.In summary, the 92 bright, Office 20lb HP Printer Paper is a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality, affordable printer paper. The impressive brightness, ideal weight, and exceptional value make it a standout option for all your printing needs. Give it a try, and I'm confident you'll be just as satisfied as I am!

Feel the quality and great value for the money.. good performance and durable.

Paper that does not jam in my Brother MFC9330CDW printer. Also, a neighbor who needs the printer every so often to print resume's loves the fact the print comes out professional looking. I'm impressed too. If you compare shop you will not find a better deal of superior paper. I will only use this type of paper for now on. I tried to support Georgia Pacific because the company gives back to the community and assisting in healing others overseas (UN Community Responsibility); but GP paper jammed all of the time. When I tried to fool the printer by shuffling (of sorts) the paper and adding more sheets and placing what it spat out (like 5 sheets of paper) in the middle; guess what? Sure enough, it will spit those 5 out again. It's like the printer codes the paper it does not want. So, I was wasting too much paper and that was angering me more than the printer spitting out multiple pieces of blank paper. I had a lot of scratch paper. I have never experienced that problem with this brand and I have been using it now for over a year. I am done with the actual book courses of my doctoral studies but before I learned of the electronic pads (ipad, Samsung, etc) I was downloading and printing thousands of pages a day for homework that was due on Thursday and a paper or two paper due by Sunday. I had a Canon for one year for my "home office" and it died. Still under warranty I called Canon. He asked me how many pieces of paper do I print a day. I told him about over 1,000/week. He said I used up the printer's5 year life span in one year; therefore, I needed a printer with a drum. That is not just extra money for the printer but the ink prices are literally out of this world! Then I received my first pad (not ipad since Apple still was not taking care of its community responsibility as far as pollution, etc) and I was able to download what was not in our books (assigned e-book reading) and read from the pad in a lounge chair and only printed he pages I needed to assist me in writing my papers. Now Apple cares about community and its people in such a way I finally removed anything Windows out of my home other than Microsoft Word Suites for iMac. Now that my 4.0 GPA can not be touched (thank goodness, that was some serious stress), I am in the process of writing my dissertation and the printer still has not failed me. I do have to print more than expected of my research but at least I know the printing will be clean and clear without smudges to parapharase without needing a magnifying glass to figure out if the blot is over an "a" or "c" type of situatiaon.  A dissertatation and two more comp exams and my doctorate will be received. A long haul but worth every penny. However, learning about products on Amazon is a daily process. I had stopped reviewing products for a long time because I just did not have the time because keeping my GPA up was first and foremost; and the reason today, (11/25/17), for reviewing is that I wanted to review the 1200 count sheets I received and have not arrived at that review as of yet. Amazon sent me pages of un-reviewed items first. I am in enough of a good mood to review a few. I will stop with the life story and yes, this is the best printer paper. One problem; however, it is sent as is (meaning as you see it - not wrapped in anything else) per UPS. Your box, depending on the person who loads it onto the truck, will at times arrive crunched. But, the paper is not touched. Just an FYI. Do not expect a perfect box when you receive it. Lol.

Works well when writing letters on it. Gives a nice appearance.

Good price

Paper is good quality but the reams were placed in too large of a box, so they were a little damaged and torn open, I will use the damaged paper for scrap but the rest is still usable in the printer.

Cheaper than big box stores, worked for my usps labels

I purchse this paper at least once per year. Three reams keeps me going for a good while. I've never experienced a jam and my documents are clean. I will continue to purchase here.

Good quality paper for everyday printing needs. The 11 x 17 size is perfect for larger documents, and the 20 lb weight feels sturdy without being too thick. The 92 brightness offers a crisp and clear print, making text and images stand out. I also appreciate that it’s made in the USA and FSC certified, so it’s a more eco-friendly choice. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it occasionally jams in my printer, but overall, it’s a reliable and affordable option for office use.

Good choice , good product and priced right

I did order this knowing it was used but it was labeled "like new." The product was usable but far from "like new" condition. There was wrinkles on the top and bottom 20 pages, the entire stack looked like it had been loose for some time and possibly just gathered up. The paper was loose in a bag that was loose in a box. The price was good and my needs were more for less precise uses. I would not recommend getting this to anyone else. It worked for me but will not get again.

Average paper

Did not take photos as expected. Left a gray shadow over picture. Pretty much worthless. Unless I did it wrong. I even taped it on but yeah basically it didn't work . The phone cam took better pics without it and still functioned fine after

It’s such a convenience to have the same Printer paper delivered to my house that I would have to drive 15mi round trip to pick up. I’ve used HP printer paper for at least 25yrs because of its quality and will continue to use it.

I have been throughly satisfied up until this point. I do a lot of printing. So I purchased the 3 reams because it’s cheaper and still has great quality and I had no reason to think otherwise. I would never  imagine I would be writing a review and submitting photos of how I received it and then of how it came out of my printer. As you can tell it came out that way

These didn’t seem like very high quality paper. Feels a bit then. Won’t buy again.  I was surprised since it’s HP paper.

Bought this paper thinking, "It's HP-brand -- must be reasonable quality".  I was very disappointed.  Paper is shockingly thin.  I've had thicker tissue paper.  Honestly, I doubt the 20-lb spec of this paper.  More importantly, though, I usually print 2-sided -- especially for things like recipes that I'm going to laminate, since I can't really laminate two pieces of paper together effectively.  2-sided printing on this paper is almost entirely counterproductive.  You can see most of what's on the reverse-side of the paper when you look at it.  Just not cool.  Not worth the money, to me.  Wish they'd put a disclaimer, "Not for 2-sided printing!"

Don't know happened with this case of paper. The papers packed so tight the printer pulls in 20 sheets sometimes. The packing is so tight the paper wont feed, it sticks so bad. I fluff the paper and separate it and just don't feed.

All the paper package was tornThe box was too heavy to carry and return

It's paper and it's white, but it's almost as thin as oxygen.

Received a perfectly intact box with damaged rim inside, can’t be used. Bought this paper many times and never had any problems. it’s upsetting that clearly damaged goods are being packaged and shipped out

This paper is so thin and cheap looking I'm embarrassed to print my business materials on it. Don't even think about printing a double sided document as the ink shows through the other side very much. Price was decent for the quantity received but the quality just isn't there. Would make good scratch paper....

I don't know what I over looked but this paper was more porous and heavier more like a construction paper feel.

When going through the printer the edges of the paper, flow up the paper is real light weight. It doesn’t have the quality of your hammer paper products.

It is not like the usual HP paper I get from other local stores.It is printable but THIN even though it states 20lbs / 92 brightnessWON'T BE BUYING AGAIN.

Really kind of flimsy and you can see through it.I didn't know HP had a low quality product at all, but I guess if you want to save money, this is what you get.

Fine for general "office-work"Bright and prints okay on my inkjet.Came poorly packaged and arrived with the pack burst open and about 30 sheets with wrinkled corners, which I tossed into recycling, right out of the ream.

I didn't expect much, but I'm more satisfied than I thought.I want to buy it again later.

PAPER WAS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.  IT WAS KIND OF THIN.  WILL NOT BE ORDERING THIS ONE ANY MORE

Could have been 5 stars...I would have given this purchase 5 stars, but one of the three reams had significant damage -- a little over a third of the paper in that ream was unusable -- had DEEP dents running the full length of the paper -- so much so that you could feel it through the wrapper. The box it came in had a tear in it but did not go all the way through --

Beware that paper is very thin and flimsy. If you’re using it for presentation or promotional flyers, I would avoid. Otherwise, it’s fine.

This is perfectly acceptable paper for normal day-to-day printing jobs.  The paper weight is heavy enough that it doesn't tear not show print through the other side.  I use it on my inkjet printer.  For high quality printing, however, you'd want something better but that fact doesn't detract from the conclusion that is is perfectly fine for day to day use.

The product came messed up, the box used for shipping was WAY to big, not enough packing to hold it in place and got shaken, as it was for a specific project with a timeline, I used what i could, the rest got trashed, not usable.. The product was as expected, that of it that survived. It works and the print is good. The paper is fine, but I will buy locally next time.

Very thin Paper.

Second time trying to write this review. Paper itself is usable, paper package the paper usually come in was ripped! Had to throw out some of the top and bottom pages. Would return if had time to. Outter package was fine, disappointed in interior packaging.

I'm not sure if it's the weight or something else, but this paper is feeding correctly through my printer.Not an enjoyable task to print anything.

it works  its paper

I have no complaints about price and I have not even gotten to use the paper yet. However when I opened box I noticed the middle ream looked damaged and discovered the picture above. 21 sheets that are not usuable

Paper is fine, was expecting more paper for the price…description wasn’t clear

They advertise 20 pound paper, it’s a lot thinner than it used to be. The same product has changed.

Had blueish tint to it

Just home printing, so Idid not send it back.

Good value for the money.

Not sure I will order again.

Paper is very thin.

Humid weather isn't very kind to this paper since my laser jet printer has a hard time pulling it through to print

The paper had a weird shiny look and flimsy feel to it. Also felt thin.

this paper is excessively blue-tinted in its efforts to earn its "bright" label and ends up looking a bit cheap. texture and weight are good / as expected. pity about the tint.

Okay

The paper is of good quality but the delivery was like someone flew by in a plain and threw it out the window. Gesh

I really love this paper, and had subscribed to receive it at the end of every month, but now the price has gone up ridiculously! I had to unsubscribe. dont think I'll be buying it anymore.

This paper causes the print to bleed or smear when using fast/draft setting. The smear is not as bad when the best setting is used but this means I’m using way more (and quite expensive) ink.

it do what paper do

Average printer paper

It's same paper you get anywhere, just better price and delivered.

The paper quality looks good but THA PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED!!!!

Thin

Half the paper was wrinkly when I opened the package... like it was stored somewhere damp or something : / Other than that it's fine, it's paper.

The paper was too thin

My regular paper for the hose printer

Fast delivery...loved that!

ABOVE MOST PAPER

I really like printing on this paper. Clear prints and it’s not too thin so can print on both sides with no bleed through of ink.

Have not used yet

I liked the quality and brightness of the paper. I used it to print church programs.

Paper is to thin and gets caught in copier,

I works great with my large printer

Thin stuff.  Good for internal or casual use, though I doubt it’s anything like archival.  I’d use a better stock for anything which had to look good.

Great price and was exactly what I needed.

Nice quality of paper, feeds well and print is very good.

The three reams of paper were as advertised. When comes to individual ream wrapping that's another story. Not one ream had a wrapper that was not split the full length. I had thirty-two years in the finishing end of a paper mill. For ream wrapper to get split it takes some force to bend and split the wrapper. The three reams all split the same, there's only one way they were put in the box already split!!!All considered if little inconvenience is ok with wrapping its great product for the price.

One reason I ordered this paper is because of the price.  Luckily it arrived not all smashed up and with torn wrappers like some poor souls have received.It is a light paper.  Another reason I ordered it through Amazon is because it would be delivered and I would not have to cart it from a store.The copy paper that I purchased some time back, maybe from Walmart, their cheapest brand, is just a bit heavier than the HP paper.Luckily I don't use it in a printer, but cut the paper into thirds and use it for notes, and also for writing, not typing on children's stories.  Oh!  I am hinting at my age.

Convenient to receive a 3 ream package. It's not too heavy for this senior to lift & bring into the house. Thanks to the free Amazon Prime delivery, it's placed on the table by my front door. The outer cardboard box keeps the inner 500 sheet packs from shipping damage. Good paper.

It appears to print and go through the printer with no problem.  No jamming or no multiple sheets feeding.I’m certainly not an expert on paper quality, but this paper does a fine job for my satisfaction.

Excellent paper. Doesn’t jam in rollers or clings sheets together.

This is decent, all round, daily use, printer/copier paper for our canine rehabilitation/rescue operation.  The color is good, the weight is acceptable (we don't need 24 lb paper which just makes file folders that much tighter) and the price is reasonable.In the past I've ordered this paper by the ream as needed to keep our month-to-month expenses down.  But Amazon tosses the ream in a box with some other things and a scrap of paper or a few air packs.  It all slams around in these during shipping and the paper arrives with the corners mashed: making it difficult to feed through a printer.  This time I ordered a case, which comes in a corrugated cardboard box, and the paper is is much better condition.  My life just got simpler and less frustrating!

Pretty annoyed with what has happened to the price of paper and a number of other products.  This isn't the cheapest or the most expensive paper but, it looks decent and feeds well through the printer.  I would buy it again.

This is the first time I have ordered from this Amazon vendor.  Product is working just fine in my printer. So far I am happy with the purchase.The big question is: how many pages I can print out compared to other ink vendors.  I wish vendors would add the # of ounces of ink in their cartridges for comparison.Dean

It's ok for everyday printing. It's a little on the light side and not very bright. It is good for everyday printing but not for formal.

I’m sure the paper will print great but the Amazon packaging has a lot to be desired!! Luckily their tape job didn’t stick to too many pieces of paper. Box it came in was in great shape but this was crazy!

The box maintains HP Office20 papers.  The box has three different packages of paper. Each package of paper has 500 sheets of paper.  The each package of paper wights: 20 lb/75 g/m2.  It is 8.5' by 11'/ 216 by 276 mm.  The paper is smooth and will work well to print different activities.

Affordable paper

Been using this paper for several years.  A full case costs 25% more than 5 months ago, 50% more than 1½ years ago, and 75% more than 2½ years ago. Don't know if caused by greed, but no longer a good value.

This paper is just a bit too thin to use for presentations or anything you need to print double sided on, as it’s very easily see-through. A little disappointed, won’t be purchasing again for my business needs, but will use the rest for personal use instead of business needs.

Does the job for daily printing and is free of speckles and blemishes. I still think the cost of paper should be a little bit less. However, this was the cheapest one I could find and it does the job.

I think this was 20 lb paper, so quite thin, but had no bleed through with Brothers inkjet, and the carriage handled the thin paper well.  Good value, but sometimes hard to separate sheets.  Will buy again.

Fits printer and fits the bill

I originally had 24 brightness which is a very sturdy paper. I bought the 20 because that's what's offered in most stores. If I had it to do over again I would order the 22. 20 is just too limp and 24 is a little bit too thick. I like they could order it three reems at once.

It's paper. Quality feel. No problems. Wish it were cheaper.

As described

Paper is paper

nothing special

Good paper. Only strange thing is that the box came sealed, but there were only 2 reems inside instead of 3. The box didn't look tampered with or anything so it must have been an error during production that the box wasn't filled.

doesn't seem to like my brother printer and neither do i lately . lots of paper jams but i think its my printer

The paper is good. However, the paper packaging was almost ripped completely off of both packages when I opened the box. Seems they could find a better way to ship so this doesn't happen.

Printer paper, works fine in the HP printer.  It is not very thick, but does what you need.  Not much to say about it otherwise.

It's paper, you print on it, what more can I say?  Good value

Delivered in bad shape.  The wrapping around paper was all torn.

I didn’t realize how lightweight this paper would be. The ink runs through when printing on both sides. Probably is a combination of my printer and the paper.

It feels good to use actual HP branded paper. After using other brands for so long you can definitely tell a difference. Going to use HP from now on.

It’s good consistent paper. Not too bright and not too heavy, but I knew what I was buying. Not suitable for handouts or presentations, but it fits my needs.

Product is fine. Delivery was awful. It was left by USPS at the clubhouse instead of to my door. Heavy items should either not be sent USPS or a requirement that they bring to the door.

It’s not the brightest or heaviest paper around. However, it’s a great paper for everyday use. Have not had a jam yet.Seller delivered it well packaged and on time.

Thin as heck. I've had 20lb paper in the past that was heavier than this. But, for the price, it will be ok for disposable printing needs.

Is a good quality if paper.

The paper matters.

No paper jams, and the printing is good. No smears or problems with the outcome. Would buy again. Fast shipping and well boxed to protect the product.

Great seller

It's just paper.  So what can I say?

Always great paper; love the 3 ream box available.

This is good quality paper and works well in my HP printer.  I don't use a lot of paper so I didn't want to order a huge box of it.  This three-ream box is a good compromise between ordering a larger box and ordering one ream at a time.

Such a great deal! I love this brand and this pack lasted me 9 months! So smooth and easy to use.  Best purchase!

I do a great deal of  printing.  The weight and texture is fine and I have enough to keep me printing for months.

Printer paper.

How good the product is

Good Price.

So far this was the best price I found. Love the brightness of the paper and my prints look so much better!

thank you

This printer paper is just wonderful.  I only needed to order 3 reams and I liked the fact that I could actually order the amount I needed an not any more.

I like the density of the paper, however I can't recall what all I used it for....1500 sheets?

Pricing OK for this product and delivered in reasonable time

Good paper

would recommend

It's nice to be able to order paper like this because it is heavy instead of having to carry it home from the store and it was better priced online

I really like this printer paper.  I was about out and ordered it as I did not have time to go shopping for it.  It came fast and delivered right to my door.  It is a nice bright white.  I have always trusted HP papers and this will not disappoint you.

Great paper at a great prive!

Always looking for good quality paper at a low price. This paper fits the bill. This was the lowest price I found at time of purchase. It has a very smooth finish and works well in my laser printer. Very pleased. Would not hesitate to purchase again if the price was right.

As expected.

Princeton looks just fine, no problem

Pleased with paper, quality and price.

Nice

Quality paper, reasonably priced.  I’ll buy again.

This paper works great for my use and it’s not super expensive.

HP has always and consistently delivered quality printer paper any time I've ordered it, and this 3 ream box comes at a decent price.  It's also not too large, so it doesn't get in the way like a full sized case of paper would.  The paper is bright white, nice and crisp, and has a nice smooth finish.  It prints fantastically, and has never jammed up my printer.  The ink absorbs into it nicely, regardless of which colors you're using.

Good quality at a fair price. Less frequent chance of running out with this quantity.

This paper is reasonably priced and functions in my laser printers very well. It isn't brightest white you can get, but for general tasks it's perfect.

This paper is high quality and prints beautifully, excellent quality and value for the cost.

GREAT

I like the paper and found that order a case is the only way to have it delivered unopened and destroyed.I was in an HP instant in club, that ended up going horribly wrong. Originally it was great, I was getting ink and paper delivered. This was the paper that they were sending me. It worked well with my printer and ink.Then the printer stopped working, so they sent me a new one for free…. But there was a catch, they didn’t not fully explain. When they switched my service, they stopped sending me the paper. The printers did not work well. I went through 3 printers in a short time, and ended up having to buy an Epson and ditch the HO service. In the mean time, I had to order paper for the HP. I had a lot of paper left, that I ended up using with my new Epson. It works great with my Epson, and the Epson ink. It actually works better with my Epson, for double sided printing. It was bleeding through with the HP ink; but it does not bleed through with the Epson. I will probably keep ordering this paper. It is a good value.

These 3 reams of paper last me around a year… great paper!!

It's Paper and it works.  What else do you need to know.

One ream of paper seems to never be enough. Three rings is perfect. Comes in a small box to store easily not just the paper that holds the ring together. Always bought quality paper but always run out. Three Reams seems to be perfect for the light to medium printer user. Prince well on my inkjet.

The quality of the paper is very good and the price even better. Before I went to Walmart for the paper, now I buy the quantity multiplied by three, at a better price and if that were not enough... Amazon brings it, I don't have to drive anywhere.

Very white; excellent product. Works for what it supposed to work for: makes your work look professional. Thanks so much!

The product is good!

The quality is excellent

Smooth quality paper!

Good paper and reasonable...nothing wrong.

Paper was needed in a hurry for a project so I picked an overnight brand known for its print quality, and durability in binders. It didn’t jam and was a good value!

Terrible quality! The color was fading! The faded color stuck to my kitchen countertop and clothes. Very hard to clean.Just putting my hand on the paper, I could see the color fading on my hand. I’m returning these paper.

This is not cardstock, it is thin like regular paper.

If you think you are getting cardstock, you are not. It’s regular paper thickness.

I was highly disappointed in this paper. The colors are beautiful but paper is so thin i can't do anything with it. I pretty much wasted my money because i have no purpose for thin colorful paper. Too thin to use on a cricut mat it'll just rip. This should be considered copy paper not cardstock

I'm not sure where to write this so I will write it here, I love Astro brights however my pack came in damaged.  One of the corners has what appears to be water damage under the plastic. Strangest thing but the damage is all the way through and the paper is useless without cutting the entire corner off.

Super disappointed!This came without any sort of wrapper. I counted the sheet and there is only about 100 here when it should be 150. There are colors missing and some regular white copy paper thrown in the middle.

I guess I thought this would be way thicker.

The clear plastic holding the paper was opened all the way across the bottom. Now I'm not sure of there's any paper missing or not.

Awesome to give to your kid with a pack of crayons. Not actually useable for anything else. Could’ve gotten the same paper for ~~4 dollars at a drug store.

This paper i ordered because it says just that...thats its paper. Instead I recieved a thick cardstock which I can not use for the intended purposes. Cost more to go return than its worth. But..it is pretty cardstock

Would not write. Ink would not come out.

All paper came damaged.There’s a fold in the middle of all sheets.

The paper arrived with plastic wrap barely containing the loose sheets.  The top sheets of paper were crinkled and torn.  Very disappointed.

Description reads, “And, since it's 20% thicker than standard paper, so you can achieve bleed-free results for single and double-sided documents. ” this is not true this IS standard paper thickness

I disliked the fact that we were shortchanged on the amount of product that was supposed to be included.

Received the item with the packaging already open. Unhappy.

They are really light, not good to use with kids. The break easily

Lots of different colors.  Package was opened and to send back would cost me too much gas so I kept it.

Speechless

This paper will BLEED into your countertops and other porous surfaces causing permanent discoloration!

This had the description of card stock which is thicker than normal paper. It’s not card stock at all. It’s colored pieces of printer paper.

the paper itself looks good however the package is opened and looks used very disappointed with amazon's service :( I will add a photo of the package

I thought I was buying a medium weight Card Stock.  You need to know that this paper is BARELY heavier than a regular piece of paper.  This weight is 24 lb.  I looked at my copy paper just now, and it is 20 lb.  So now I have ordered 65 lb Card Stock and hope it is not too thick for my printer.  The colors of this paper are very pretty.  I will find another use for it.

I ordered this in January and just opened it for a class project for my 6th graders.  Many of the pages have the corners cut off and some are ripped.  These pages were buried in the middle of the bundle.  Needless to say, I have 61 6th graders upset, as well as their teacher!  We didn't discover this until we were well into the project using part of the paper.  Not a fan at the moment.

The paper is very thin and feels very cheap. Like many others, I searched for card stock and this came up so I thought I was getting card stock. Even still, this paper is no better quality than cheap printer paper. The only pro is that the colors are pretty decent for the price but by no means “rich”.

When I searched for "card stock" this came up, repeatedly. and in description says it is thick paper. it is no thicker than good quality of printing paper. I bought it because I wanted card stock, or at least something thick. Is absolutely not thick. Will say the colors are beautiful and vibrant, but this is not what I wanted. Disappointed in the "thickness" of the paper.

It is a nice paper but it came open! I don’t know if someone opened and returned it but I got an opened package which I’m not sure is complete

I bought this to use in my collages.  As soon as liquid glue hits it, it bleeds, and the color smears over everything else.

Copy paper was opened causing the paper to be warped.

I expected to recieve thick paper since it's cardstock but it's as thin or even thinner than normal printer paper.

OK if you want BRIGHT almost neon-like colors. I was hoping for more traditional colors. That said it is great quality paper.

Ordered one package of Spectrum & loved it!!  So I ordered 2 more, but chose different color options from the pull down menu. Don’t bother. I keep being sent the Spectrum color group. Very frustrated

In my initial reaction, I was really satisfied with the intensity of the colors. Touch testing, the paper is on the thinner side and less sturdy than what I've worked with before. However, I found it satisfactory as a beginner in papercutting, since it was easier for me to use a blade to cut out desired shapes. One main issue I had was when using glue. The color bleeds out, which leaves pale splotches. I made due with it, but I will not buy this product again and will look for an alternative.

I love the colors, but my package was opened when I received it.  I'm not sure if all of my paper was still in there.

I did a search for colored card stock, and found this the best price. Very disappointed to find out that it was colored paper & not card stock, which was what I searched for!

I got this paper a few months ago and it was great. I was impressed with thickness and quality. Got it again a few days ago, same paper, same description and it is significantly lighter weight, not at all what I wanted.

The package arrived open. There are only 22 colors 6 sheets each but cover says 25 colors.This is not a sale or deal as described.Trying to lure customers by reducing price and also reducing sheets.Unacceptable. I have reached out to Amazon.

This "cardstock" is only a step or two above construction paper. It is thinner than I wanted and does not cut cleanly; it leaves a rough edge. The colors are very nice and bright and there is a good variety of colors.

My package of paper came open and loose. The paper was not sealed in its package and so the paper was just kind of loose in the box.

The colors are lovely -  clear  and bright.  The weight of the paper is the same as regular paper.  I thought it was to be heavier, like construction paper.

The plastic around the paper was ripped open when it arrived. It looks like it was opened before it was shipped.

Does not feel like 24 lb paper.  Generally, colored/construction paper is much thicker than this. Great colors though!  A lot of shades to choose from.

These are just regular colored papers! I was expecting a thickness of construction papers and was disappointed 😞

This paper is ok. I use it for printing the cover of my zine. I thought it was cardstock though and it’s not, it’s just normal paper.

Too many dark colors. Can't print black ink on black paper.

Paper is just as pretty as expected. But, the plastic packaging was all ripped up when I got it. Only a few of the sheets of paper were ruined.

shrink mark on some paper.

Great colors but to thin to use in certain projects

Instead of 150 sheets it only had 147, such a small inconvenience but mattered because I actually needed 150 sheets.

Ordered cardstock paper. Got this instead

Perfect the color is bright and beautiful

Colors are very nice

Just paper. So it’s fine.

Nice product. Like other people said, you get what you pay for. The product did come with damage, however it was minor and expected based on either peoples reviews. The edge of the product was partially opened and a few sheets of paper had been bent.The paper is not very thick, probably just a little thicker than printer paper but not enough to be classed as cardstock. It is good for projects, as of right now, I have used to help decorate some of my projects. There is a lot of paper so it will keep me from having to go to any craft stores for a while lol.4/5 (knocked off a star for the condition it arrived in).Probably would not buy again as the paper is too flimsy. Not the fault of the company, it just doesn't suit my own needs (I'm more of a cardstock kinda person).

Let me start by saying this is a really beautiful product. If that's all you're looking for, this is perfect for you. However, if thickness matters, it's important for you to know that it is NOT uniform. For me, the darkest red color in my pack was closer to 120 gsm  (think: standard construction paper thickness, which I bought this to get away from), significantly thicker than advertised. Other dark colors seemed to vary between 100 and 120 gsm. The brighter colors all seemed to be uniform at 89 gsm.Overall, it's definitely great for the price.

I liked the bright vivid colors for special projects.

My pack was missing the plain white but other than that I loved the variety of colors

I needed some colored paper for backing in a live, love,  laugh picture frame. The colors are definitely bright and vibrant. Many of the reviews seem to mention the thickness of the paper being too flimsy. I attached a video and hopefully that’s helpful. In my opinion it’s not any thinner than regular printer paper but it’s not as thick as construction paper. I also used it for printing and everything seems to come out well.

I was looking for neon cardstock to use for a Halloween decoration. My baby is in the NICU and I wanted something bright and colorful to put in her room. I found this and read the reviews. Some people noted how flimsy it was. It's a bit sturdier than printer paper, but the nurse and I needed to put a book behind it when getting my daughter's hand and footprints. For what I wanted it for, this pack of paper was worth the buy.

Love the variety of bright colors but ....They do vary in thickness and the top multiple sheets (8) are useless due to a weird fold/slice straight down the center (ripped open with barely touching it) ... Other than that they are paper and can be used as paper

Very good quality. Definiely brighter than other colored constrction papers.There needs to be dividers inbetween the papers. Some colors are so close matching it's hard to differentiate which color you actually choose.

Very vibrant and lots of colors!

Colors and paper quality were as advertised. Very happy with the product.

Loved the paper but it was thinner then I expected, bought them to do the paper roses with cricut

I had wanted the bright colored card stock, and ordered this by mistake. Its still great for crafting projects, but not as heavy as what I wanted.  Am sure we will find plenty of uses for it, and my granddaughter loves the colors.

My daughter enjoyed this. She loves to draw and she enjoys making things. This was a good choice especially because it comes with different colors.

Colors are great even tho paper a little thinner than I wanted.  Overall a good bargain

Not as "bright" as I thought.

good selection of colors,  wish a little brighter -  being astro brights, i thought they would be like neon colors, they are not .

Works great and ideal

Awesome paper only about four of the colors were super bright under black light

Did not pay attention to the quanity. Small package of paper for price but kids will love colors

Paper itself is fine. Corner of package was damaged, so sheets of paper are not flat.

Craft idea for myself.

Made for very nice party invitations.  Wide choice of colors.

I love the colors

it works for me. basic colored paper

Nice color package

Beautiful bright looking papers but it stains. I bought it to have my toddler paint on it with water but it stained the brush and the color transferred to the desk it was taped to. I’m sure it would be fine kept dry but I also wonder if the ink would smear since it’s glossy? Haven’t tried printing on it though since that was not my intention for these papers.

Quilling

Lots of color variety, vibrant and bright colors. The quality is nice and sturdy but not thick like card stock. Good value. I used them to make a bunch of birds to hang from a canopy for a show and a macaw on a tree.

I didn't want card stock but letter/printer quality and this was perfect!  Great, bold colorsaturation.  Works easily and well for so many needs.  Easy to cut.  Generous pkg of paper with a wide assortment of colors!

I love this beautiful paper! It's not thick like cardstock, but it's not super thin either. It works very well in cardmaking and junk journaling. Because it is paper, it doesn't create too much bulk. For best results, when using liquid glue, don't go too heavy with it, and smooth it out in a thin layer before adhering the paper down if you can. I will purchase this again whenever I start to run out.

great colors and pretty good price

This pack of paper really surprised me. The colors were so much brighter in person. This worked great for my daughters project and she is excited that she has extra for her arts and crafts as well.  The value paid is great and the amount of papers in the package was surprisingly great. Def will buy this brand again.

Works great

Great paper for amount is cost

I bought this to make origami toys for my bird to play with. I also put some through our paper shredder and stuffed his foraging toys. He loves it!

Product was just as described.  A thicker paper would be beneficial.  A more rigid package would be a benefit too.

Kept me & 2 kids busy for hours!

Love this paper great for printing fun stuff. Ease to use and value for the money.

Gifted this to a teacher and she loved it!

I manage a small privately owned office and I was tired of printing sign up sheets and advertising services on white paper, so I got this. So far my co-workers seem to like it and I’ve gotten some new notary customers (they mentioned the new bright sign!) prints easily too!

Everthing I expected and the price seems good to me. It is a good product if you don't need a large quanity.

Super bright colors good price

Great for photo backgrounds and borders. Useful and handy in all paper projects

Bought this for art and it worked terrific. These colors are super bright and the paper is not thin. (Not thick as cardstock but just a good solid weight)

Just what we were hoping for for paper airplanes.

This colored paper is awesome! It comes with 3 packs of 150 sheets. I originally thought it only came with one pack but it came with 3, which made this such a great price and there are so many different colors. I use this paper as organizers/dividers for my school binders. I have also printed a few times using this paper and it worked great. It's definitely a must buy if your in need of colored paper!

Needed different colored paper for a project. Nice, thick and goes through my printer easily.

Great price

If you need a way to display your students artwork without using so many staples, this is the way to go. Hot glue mini clothes pins and have them help add their art on.

This paper is a great quality for doing projects yourself!  It saves money and produces a great result!

The weight of this paper is good enough to make things that last when doing arts and crafts. The color selection is a lot better than some brands. I use it for scrap books. I like the versatility.

Worked perfectly for the Valentine I created.

Love it

Not very heavy duty, but it has a lot of colors to choose from.

Great for the class projects!

Good really bright, nice paper

To be honest, I wasn't expecting this paper to live up to its description, but it certainly does!  The colors are very bright and rich; the paper is of excellent quality.  My six-year-old grandson had no trouble cutting it accurately for his projects and we were both delighted with the results.  I can think of many, many paper projects for which this paper would be perfect.  I'd definitely buy this again and again.

very vibrant colors. quality great

Bright colors stand out on bulletin board.

Brightly colored. No imperfections.

Great colors and easy to work with.

The colors are vibrant and the paper is great quality! No complaints here. :)

Very bold colors

very good

Beautiful quality colored paper! The brights look great!

My mistake. When they say bright, they mean BRIGHT. it was a bit brighter than I expected but certainly within their description

The vibrancy of these papers is superb!  The weight is excellent. The variety of shades of each color is fantastic!  Very well pleased and will be ordering again!

I was expecting the paper to be flimsy but I was pleasantly surprised it's thiner than cardstock but great for crafts and the colors are so vibrant.  I would definitely buy again

Meant to order cardstock however this paper cuts pretty easy.

This was delivered with damaged packaging and some of the paper was missing. I needed it for my kids school project and didn’t have the time to send it back. The colors are vivid and the actual product was great but AMAZON needs to DO BETTER.

My daughters and I really like this paper, works great with pens and markers.

Working with geneaology ...means lots of categorical surnames and I wanted to use different colors for the different blood lines.  Intend to use in a  3 ring binder (must punch out holes in paper to do this) .  I wanted to hand write on them(...not computer printing.)  No matter what the reason...all those colors ..you gotta have them!  Origami, card embellishments, collage, mache, wrappings, too many uses to think of.

I use this paper to glue my drawings on to put in my DIY sketchbook! This paper is NOT thick like cardstock. It is thicker than regular printer paper but not by too much. I saw that some people had messed up corners/packaging but mine came in fine so I think it just varies. The colors are nice and vibrant :)

I ordered this because I thought I was getting cardstock paper this in not cardstock you can't just send people what you want to.

What can I say? It is colored paper after all.  Nice sharp colors.

I love this pack of neon colored paper! I am using it for a journal that I'm writing/making with a Facebook group I'm on. I'm going to print out 4 different decks of cards to add to my journal. And I'm going to use more than 4 colors for each deck of cards! These papers just make me happy looking at them! They're just beautiful!

I'm picky when it comes to paper...I hate it being too thin that it would and bends when you just move it and I hate when it's like cardstock. This is in the middle, it has weight to it but isn't too thick. We use this for coloring and the markets don't bleed on it or through. The colors are vibrant as well as well saturated. I will buy these again, better price than or Staples.

I have never written anything like this before, but I feel that it is important to point out the mistakes here. The paper sizes were inconsistent, with each piece being of a different size, so they were not uniform. I unknowingly printed several copies and had to print them again. When I reprinted, the same issue occurred, so I spent a lot of time organizing them by paper size. Furthermore, when I received them from the locker, the packaging was in very poor condition. It seems like they sent defective products from the beginning.

My only recommendation to others is DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER.  The information posted, plus the label on the reams states "99% Jam Free."  It is anything but jam free.  I have used printing/copy paper of many different weights in my laser printers for years, but never this particular brand and 20lb weight.  Never before have I suffered with paper jams in the printers.  This paper, I have suffered numerous jams on different laser printers.  The last jam, I just cleaned out of the printer, which was so severe that I had to disassemble the printer insides to get it out.  The paper sheet is so thin (cannot be 20lb!) it bunched up in a half-inch jam that it took well over an hour to disassemble the printer (using screwdriver), pry the paper bunch out using medical hemostats (the bunch broke into small chips when attempting to pull out of the mechanism), and then reassemble the printer.  It was bunched up so tightly that it was impossible to pull out just by opening the printer covers. I replaced this paper with another brand 20 LB paper that I had very little left and printing is complete and smooth, no jams.  This Hammermill paper has caused at least 8 - 10 jams, the last jam being the worst, the prior jams were pulled out by opening the printer covers.  Only a quarter of the first ream has been used, but I am now stuck with 3 reams of paper that is not even good enough for toilet paper.  I will NEVER, EVER buy Hammermill brand paper again.

I never knew "bad quality" paper really do exists. I thought the price is just a reflection of how big the company is and the paper are pretty much the same. WRONG!!!!! I bought this paper and i thought the price was pretty reasonable, stuff prints out perfectly on the paper. But the problem is, when I use highlighters to highlight the notes on the paper, it just become super blurry and dirty, and the ink always gets on to my highlighter and now my highlighters are all dirty and I have to try keep using the same highlighter when highlighting stuff on this hammermill paper so i wouldnt have to throw more highlighters away. At first I thought it was the problem of the ink, but it doesnt make sense because I have always been using HP's ink and there was nothing like this happened before. Then I figured it might be the paper, so, I switched out the paper to Staples paper, and the highlighter works perfectly fine on staples paper, and it doesnt mess up my highlighters at all. Now i'm just gonna throw all hammermill's paper away because the paper couldnt even get the ink on it, and doesnt really save you money cuz you might have to buy extra highlighters....DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL, DO NOT BUY!

This paper is terrible! First of all, it is the thinnest "so-called" 20 lb paper I have ever seen. It constantly jams and is useless. Do not buy. Mine went into the wastebasket!

The paper is so thin that when it comes out of the printer, it's curling up and we'll not go into the power feeder, it's just jams.

the paper package was open from both ends (paper cover was somehow thorn) as it has been badly handles or maybe fell down from somewhere. The papers inside the package looked OK, but I was suspicious there might be dust inside it if it was stored with damaged package.Anyhow I decided to give it a chance with my new HP printer which has been working flawlessly. On the second page of my print job, paper got jammed, and after trying my best to gently remove the paper, this is what I got! I will not endanger my printer by using any of this low-quality product anymore.

I placed a ream of this paper into my brand new printer tray. At first the paper was beautiful and everything was fine. Then I started noticing some new printed pages had a weird crimple down the middle or side. At first I thought it was my new printer, but when I removed the ream from the tray, I saw the crimple within the ream of paper itself. Every third paper was crimpled like this. I look into the paper from the bag it came in, same thing. This is a factory defect with this paper. It means I will either have to pick out every single crimpled page from the ream, or count my losses and buy new paper somewhere else. I ended up buying a different brand instead. Waste of money.

This ream of paper was a waste of my money. It does not fit my printer properly. It is an odd Euro-size 8712 and does not fit my printer drawer. it is a total waste of money. I am sorry I ordered it. I wish I could return it, but I didn't open it upon receiving it and now it might be too late. I'm so angry about his odd size There should have been a CLEAR warning that it is not standard 8 1/2 by 11 USA size printer paper. And it was more expensive than my usual paper which I could not find here at Amazon for my HP paper. I understand there's a shortage of printer paper, but all the same, there should be a warning on this paper that it is NOT STANDARD SIZE.

I cannot believe this because it has never happened to me in 20 years of buying paper for my printer, but this paper does not fit in my printer!  It's too long.  I measured it and also found it is not the standard width.  It measures 8 1/4" X 11 1/2".  I have to cut it off with my paper cutter to fit it into my printer, which is obviously a pain, and still it's not the standard width.  Unbelievable!  Upon closer examination, I do see that the package calls it "size A4", whatever that means.  It doesn't say it is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.  What kind of printer takes paper this size?  And from Hammermil?  I'm shocked.

This is not a regular A4. I am very disappointed.

I barely opened this product (it's been a while since I ordered it).I was surprised to see that it is the same size as my regular standard-size USA paper, and the paper is YELLOW. It's too late to return but not too late to review.I ordered A4 paper so I could print some sewing patterns that were sized to A4 paper. I'm no expert on A4 vs. USA Standard paper, but from what I've read, there is a difference (even if slight).

This is A total joke! It says standard  A4, but it is much longer and narrower than the regular A4 paper! I meant to use it for my patients file, it doesn’t match with other pages and it makes the whole stack of my paperworks looks funky like a joke! I bought  two pack with1000 pages of it and it is useless because it doesn’t even fit into regular envelopes with 3 folds !  I really hate this brainless company makes such a stupid product to confuse and mess up the market!

The packaging as already been torn open, likely a returned product. Will be returning this.

Received an used item. Package was open and there are about 1/10  papers are missing from the package. Decided not to return to save my gas money to go through the hassle.

BEWARE! This is NOT your normal American letter size (8.5" x 11") paper. This is 8.25" x 11.75". It doesn't fit in my printer paper tray; it's too long. My mistake, I guess. I should have looked up what A4 is. But why would I suspect that the rest of the world has different standard size paper than the U.S. and why would it be sold in the U.S.? I live in the U.S. and I ordered from the U.S. But, aside from the size problem, the ream came with some pieces of the paper stuck together along one edge like a tablet of paper, where you pull off one piece at a time. You can see in the video the sticky whatever-they-use-on-tablets (of paper) along the top edge of the sheets of paper. POOR QUALITY! (And it's made in the U.S.A. Sad.) So much for their 99.99% jam-free claim.

The paper I was sent this time measures 8'5/8 not 8' 1/2 across. This is apparent when compared to other legal paper and when measured with a measuring tape. We recieved a defect product. Money completly wasted and affected my small busisness operations. When it wouldn't load in the letter tray I knew something was off. When I put in in the tray the best I could some of the pages became jammed or didn't print right. Scans are also required for my job and guess what, the paper does not fit in the scanner either. Suprise suprise. Not sure how a defect like this could happen. I hope no one else had to deal with this.

The paper should be white but it is not. It is a bit yellowish and brownish. I am going to throw it away to the trash bin. Afwul quality. Never buy it.

That was slit for 3 reams.  I thought it was for 5.

The packaging of one of the packs of paper was damaged and it seemed paper was missing. The packaging for the other pack of paper was fine. They were both placed in a box which was fine. We only want to return one (1) pack and receive one (1) pack as a replacement.

This lightweight paper does nothing but cause jams.  After multiple jams I changed the paper to another brand/item and the jams disappeared.I'm just sorry that I bought 3 reams as I cannot return it due to one ream being opened and depleted some.  So I'M STUCK.  Learned again - you get what you pay for.

Every single ream of paper was open.  The paper was creased and damaged.  Terrible packing.  Will never order from this person again.

Very thin poor quality paper with uneven density and color. Paper with a density no higher than 70 g/m2, and a gray-white color. Under no circumstances should you buy this for printing, especially on an inkjet printer. It might be suitable as a notepaper. It was delivered in a torn package

I was very disappointed with the quality of this paper as compared with the Amazon Basics Multipurpose paper of the same 20 pound weight.  As soon as I took out the first page I noticed how thin it was to the touch.  Sure enough, when I placed a blank paper over paper with type on it, the type showed through (see photo).  Holding it up to the light, you can see how thin the product is.  I had to return as anything printed on this wouldn’t last for its flimsiness.

Might've been ok paper, if only Amazon had packaged it properly. Instead, this large ream of paper was tossed in a too-big box without so much as a few of those inflated bag-thingies to keep it from shifting (any other time they use twenty of those things for an unbreakable item). So, instead of pristine paper, I received a busted-open ream with smashed edges and box dirt throughout. Printers are known to jam with perfect paper, so there's no chance this mess will ever work. Should've just gone to a brick and mortar store. Lesson learned.

These reams of paper I bought are not standard 8 x 11 in in size and putting the info on the ad in metric instead of inches is disturbing.  Perhaps I need to go elsewhere to purchase my paper.  So disappointing as I used what I had on hand from previous purchase which was the correct size, opened a new ream and now have none of the correct size to use at the moment.

I've purchased more 4 packages of paper with 5 teams each. I'm not going to open every single package to make sure the paper is in good quality. That's your job. I've had several paper jams because of the poor quality and HOLES on 3 of 5 reams. To be told I can't have a refund on a replacement is a slap in the face because it's not something I found out until I used the package.

Might sound crazy, but this paper is a special size and weight for making paper airplanes. The pack was purchased for a Christmas present. It looks terrible! Very disappointed in the condition!

For the cost I figured it was the same as if I had to go locally for it and it was on the expensive side so I figured it would be a higher quality paper. It Jams every other print job unfortunately. The 3 reams will be trash.

This is one of the most deceptive items I’ve seen on Amazon. It sows 5 out of 5 stars for this paper, but if you scroll down to actually look at the reviews, there are plenty of negative reviews that are not listed on the star chart. I will not purchase this paper again. It is extremely thin and makes duplex printing nearly impossible because the ink bleeds through. Because it is so thin, it occasionally jams in the printer or multiple sheets feed through at a time.I plan to return it.

When I ordered this copy paper, I assumed it was the standard 8 x 11" as are all copy paper I've ordered previously. In the description, this one is shown in mm, not inches, but I didn't realize it meant it was 8 x 11 1/2". Who in the U.S. uses that weird size in a printer??? I am going to have to return it and order new paper elsewhere. Very misleading information.

Doesn't absorb ink well. Still smudges easily months after printing.

Buyer beware: this is not regular 8 and 1/2 by 11 inch sized paper.  It is A4 which is 8 and a quarter inch by 11 and 11/16ths inch, so it is a little narrower and a little taller than the standard size paper used in the USA.  Heads up!!

Sticks very badly, wasting paper by pulling multiple sheets and sometimes printing across 2 sheets. Problem occurs on multiple printers across different brands.Also, the last 2 packages we received are not 8 1/2 inches wide, but close to 8 3/4 inches wide. Meaning they don't fit in the printer fully, causing a curl which jams the printer if it will even try to take a page.

You have got to be kidding me that you would sell what "appears" to be 8 1/2" X 11" that is too big to fit in an ordinary binder for this size paper.Oh, you put numbers in the explanation saying the size and the numbers were not in inches ... OH! OKAY.8 1/2 X 11 has been a universal measurement FOREVER ... really?!

I'm a notary signing agent so I print a lot of loan docs, I usually have no issue with Hammermill paper but this last batch was terrible, I would say about every 10 sheets or so the paper would have an bad crease down the page, so bad I would have to re print that page and that is very wasteful. Be better Hammermill with quality control!

This printer is horrible. The inc get low very fast.

Most of the pages had creased lines running lengthwise. I bought this for my students to complete projects on and we are all dissatisfied with the quality of the paper. Unfortunately, there was no time to replace it due to a deadline. Will never use this brand again and neither will 163 of my students.  See photos.

The paper is so thin it jams my copy machine at work! I looked at reviews and it said the paper was durable so I thought it would be okay. Never buying again!

My fault completely that I must not have read the details as well as I thought!!! I paid $60 for 6 reams of paper….omg!!!! Won’t return because that costs $14 more!!! I need to be more careful. I’m in too much of a hurry sometimes.

It looked like standard sized paper but definitely was not. I didn't even know there was a different size. The measurements were metric which should have been a clue.This paper is about 8.25 X 11.5 inches, and by the time I realized something was off I had already used several pages, otherwise I'd return it.Pretty annoyed.

I assumed this was the standard 8 1/2 x 11" size paper but it is some odd size; not legal size either, but something in between the two. My fault I guess. Didn't notice until I opened it. Even the package is close enough in size that I didn't notice that it is about 2" longer. Ugh.

Got a product like this.

I was disappointed with this purchase.  I bought 3 reams. Every single one was open. One was obviously missing paper. Will not buy again.

This was apart of my son’s school supplies and it was not package properly the outer paper is not sufficient to hold so many copy paper. I’m so disappointed now I’d have to spend extra money to purchase another and it definitely will not be on amazon!!!!!!! I’d give this not star but I had to choose a star in order to submit the review

I'm not sure what this paper is, but it is certainly not for use in a printer for sure.  Won't feed, is literally see-through and a very strange size.  Description is quite misleading.  I mean when you are ordering Hammermill copy paper and this is presented as such, you should be able to reasonably deduce that is what it is.

Do Not Recommend this product.

Nearly half the sheets have jammed my printer. I have not been able to print a single document successfully because the pages are repeatedly jamming. Returning and running to the office supply store to purchase a higher quality paper.

OK, the price was low. Took 2-1/2 WEEKS to arrive. Ream of paper thrown in larger box with no padding, bounced around during shipment battering corners. Then I put in my printer. WTH? It's not 8.5 x 11". It's 8.25 x 11.75"!"A4 size"? What is that? Luckily it fits in my HP printer, and it works. But never again!

Disappointed in the size. Everything said this was standard size copy paper yet it is not as wide and much longer than everything I have. Will not even fit in a standard school folder. Quality is fine just not the size. Guess I will be trimming the next 500 copies I have to make. Sad

I have never had an issue with my printer until I put this paper into it.  2-3 pages will go through at once and it ends up wasting paper and time and ink (because one page will print across two so I have to reprint) I do not recommend!!

Package torn worse that the 1st Hammermil Paper delivered on 7/17/2024, which I was supposed to return but now I am not happy because the 2nd package was also torn worse than the 1st package of Hammermil Paper!!

advertise to pull up in thermal paper search but not thermal paper  waste of  money and time

When I opened the box the paper pack was already ripped open on both sides and some pieces of paper was folded and crumpled. The box only had one other item inside but it was fine so it didn’t happen during shipping.

Product was fine however my package was opened and several papers were pulled out and left hanging half way out

The paper size is bigger than A4 so it doesn't fit in my printer

I thought I was ordering 8 1/2 x 11, but it is "A4" and is lightly narrower and longer than standard copy paper.  I did not open the first of two reams until the opportunity for return had expired, so I have to keep it and learn from my mistake. I guess the kids can use it for drawing because I cannot use it for my work.  I did not even know such a size existed!

This is NOT 8.5"x11" paper --- that doesn't effect my review because it 210mm x 297mm, but just a warning to anyone who may be ordering without looking closely at the description as I did.I am, however, disappointed at the quality of the packing, there are many pages with wrinkles and folds within the ream, so I wouldn't purchase again even if it was my preferred dimensions. These wrinkles aren't form handling, they're pressed in from the manufacturing and packing process.

I guess the price is telling. It has to be why it was one of the most affordable.We have found three different weights of paper in the first reem. One of which is the actual paper as labeled but we have only seen a few pieces of it in the reem we have opened. The other paper is pretty much as low quality as you would ever want. One third or so content is paper so thin anywhere your fingers touch it causes a permanent wrinkle you cant get out. It feels like garbage and it is really obvious it doesn't belong in this reem. I've never seen paper like this before. Perhaps it isnt copy paper and maybe it is meant for some purpose I dont know about.. but the brightness is so off it looks nearly transparent and a blueish gray..I dont know how something like this could happen but it did and we are the unlucky buyers.Our advice is buyer beware. Were a bit unhappy with our purchase.

Although the ream of paper was wrapped in plastic, the main packaging was torn on the side and some of the sheets were creased at the bottom.

The website says it's A4, but when I received it, it was not, not what I expected, that poor quality cost 10 dollars, not worth, don't buy it

I have used Hammermill paper for two decades.  This new batch is not like previous orders.  It looks and prints like cheap off-brand 18lb paper.  Ink bleeds through this paper, giving fuzzy letters, and I can easily see the ink from the other side of the page.

I was looking for A4 papers and was glad that I found this package of A4 papers at that time. It was for printing the document, but quality of the papers was not that good and they were too thin. So I felt too embarrassed to submit this paper as documents. I had to re-purchased other A4 papers (Kokuyo KB paper).  Now I'm using this paper as scratch paper.

The description says 20 lb paper. I have been using 20 lb paper for the longest time, and this is *not* 20 lb (I compared them side by side). It is way thinner and the printing shows on the reverse side.  I thought being Hammermill, it would live up to its brand name, but it does not. So just be aware that this is very thin copy paper and not good for any kind of quality documents

I have ordered this paper several different times and never had an issue.This time the quality is completely different.  The paper is thin and flimsy.  Definitely not the same as previous orders.  Same description though so I’m not sure how that works.  Won’t order again.

I had read a review of someone who sounded so annoyed because they couldn't open the poly wrapped reams of paper. I thought that was kind of silly, but you know what? It's very annoying to try and open these reams of paper wrapped in plastic.  You can't rip them open with your hands, you have to get a scissor, then you're cutting the paper with the scissor. No, just No.  I just ordered the paper wrapped reams and life is better.  The paper wrapped reams are annoying and who needs that when you're trying to work, or ever..... I liked just the box of paper with no wrapped reams, but now I can't seem to find that. I like reamless paper

Paper arrived in ripped packaging, with some pages on both ends of the ream torn or folded as other reviews have mentioned. The paper feels thinner than 20lbs copy, and wrinkles very easily. Some of the pages I've used so far don't have perfectly straight edges, instead have small jagged cuts. In addition to this, when looked at under bright light, you can see that there are splotches where the thickness of the paper varies quite a bit. It does absorb ink well, and doesn't seem to smudge so at least it has that going for it. I wouldn't order again.

Hammermill print paper is not the quality I expected. It's very thin,dull in contrast to other brands.I regret this purchase.Not worth the cost.

The papers the cover came with was already ripped and opened. This does not seem like a delivery issue because the main box was ok but looks like the product was already ripped and opened when packaged. The papers inside are intact but i am not sure if there are papers missing since it was completely open when arrived. I will not be returning because i need to print something right away on an A4 size paper which aren’t readily available in retail shops near me, plus the papers inside looks fine.

The paper is a different size even though the cover says A4. Be careful!

European sized paper. Be careful that this product is what you are really looking for. Not sized for US printers unless you can change settings to fit. I use it for scrap paper notes.

I was surprised to see how small this package of paper is. I expected a full ream, which is 500 sheets, and this "ream" is only 400. Admittedly, if you look closely, the description does say it's only 400 sheets, but I've never seen a ream that wasn't 500 so I didn't even read the description. I thought $9.99 was kind of pricey for a ream of paper in the first place, and to learn that it's for 20% less product than I expected is really irritating.

This paper is very thin.  It is not suitable for formal letters or similar important documents.

The paper itself is good, I'll start by saying that; it hasn't jammed on myself or my staff to the best of my knowledge and is of above average quality.  The rating is due to the extreme rip off of the offered price, and of course purchasing this is my fault because I knew the price, I just wanted convenience. The price is so far off base that it isn't nearly worth the niceness of not driving to the office supply store; you can literally get triple the amount of paper for this price anywhere. I slapped myself for buying this and I'm hoping to dissuade others from making this convenient but financially-astoundingly idiotic purchase

I'd only recommend this paper if you're planning on having a lot stacked together and want it to be lightweight. The consistency of the paper is not a uniform white either; it's sort of "spackled" so to speak, when comparing it to other copy paper (that is similarly priced from Microcenter) you can clearly see a bit of texture in the paper. It also did not hold up well against humidity at all. I would not recommend and I don't plan on buying this again.

The model does not match the actual situation . Not 210mm, only 205mm, hope to replace.Not 210mm, only 205mm, hope to replace.

The paper is very thin and does not seem to be 20lb. Compared to similar brands like Boise it seems cheap and flimsy and I'm surprised it's made by a leading paper company. I don't want to put my professional reports on it, but maybe it would be okay for drafts or things you don't care about (though I'm a little worried that it is more likely to jam my printer because it seems so thin). I will not buy Hammermill brand again.

The sender sent a broken package, a few papers inside was broken. I think the paper itself is fine. But the sender should not send a broken package, or should reduce the price and notify the buyer

This A4 paper is very thin and flimsy. Otherwise, prints come out OK, and I haven't had any printer jamming issues.

Not worth going through return process, but this paper is NOT 8 and a half by 11. It's a bit larger. Printer will do it but comes out funny looking. NO idea why paper of this size was made.

Paper came with 3 hole punches in it. Didn’t see that in description. Package was also ripped open so not sure I got full amount. Will not purchase again

Great quality but price is higher than in stores I understand this is due to weight!

Many of the pages would stick together when printing. Having to open the printer and re-load non-printed pages.

The package came broken up the individual ream covers were torn causing the edges of paper to fail to be accepted by the printer causing to throw away a lot of paper. Plus the cost increased by 50%. For my purpose that was my last purchase.

This paper is brittle feels like recycled paper. It continually gets stuck in my SAMSUNG printer. Unfortunately I purchased 1500 sheets of it. I'm going back to Office Max for my print paper and if I do not have the same issues, I will recycle the whole box.

Confusing with the size of a4 Paper

Only purchased this because I had left over gift card balance I wanted to get rid of and I thought it would be much better quality then the $3 copy paper I've been buying at Walmart for years. That however is not the case. This copy paper is virtually identical to the $3 copy paper at Walmart. Don't overpay for this. It's a ripoff!

When I opened the box, the paper was opened and it looks like some sheets are missing. This was probably a packaging issue or the sealing was not done properly

Its NOT standard size - 8.5" X 11"This paper is about 1/2" LONGER than regular paper. It fits in the printer, (after you expand the tray holder) but will not fit a standard folder of binder.

Too long of length.  Not what I had ordered.  I wanted 8 1/2 X 11

Package was already falling apart on arrival. The paper prints poorly and is not suited for double sided printing because of how thin the paper is. Will not purchase again.

Paper looks like good quality however this paper jams in our printer, costco paper doesn't jam.....go figure

This stuff keeps getting stuck together or jamming in my printer. This is the first time I bought more than 450 sheets at a time. I don't really use that much, but this stuff is not to my satisfaction. Will avoid this brand at all costs.

This paper is ultra thin and you can clearly see print from the backside. Do not expect to print on both sides with this paper. I have not had any paper jams with this paper, but will not buy again. (I have a laser printer)

I don't know what it is about this paper but my printer keeps jamming since I started using it! I've gone back to school and have a lot of stuff to print out and every time I turn around I keep getting an error message with this paper! I even tried paper from another company just to see if it was this paper or the printer and with the other paper, I printed out 24 pages with no problem at all! Waste of money!

Papers are not regular A4 size, they longer (about 1cm difference) and narrower than the normal size, so they are not fit any folder, and probably printer either.

Almost 20% of the pages I've used to-date are creased resulting in reprinting or having to sort through the ream to remove the creased pages.

External box was fine but an entire ream of paper was ruined.  looked like a something was inserted and tore the paper through.  won't return because i don't want to go to post office but it should be replaced

Crappy cheap paper. Not at all soft as expected and it comes in a tiny little box. It was probably my mistake to not read the details but for $18.99, I expected to get a nice big box that offices usually get, but NOPE! You can def do better than this.

The bulk of the paper appears to be ok, but the packaging of all 3 reams were damaged.Possibly from being tossed around and may not be the sellers fault, but may need to be better packaged to prevent damage.

The paper is a good grade, and I might have ordered more, but not from here . . . .I ordered 3 packages of 3 reams each- which makes 9 reams, right? Only received 8 reams all together. Tried several times to contact Customer Service to correct this and got the run around each time. Item was marked as being a late shipment when I had already received the 8 reams. Couldn't get CS to understand that I had received 8 reams and needed one more. They were mostly stuck on the late delivery. Problem is still not resolved.

the cover paper was torn on each of the three packs

ok but thinner than other paper this weight - jams in my hp printer

Price was right - but paper was embarrassingly thin for business use.

Paper is a nice bright white, price is good  but paper is thin.

The price and quality are exactly what you figure you'd get

I gave this a 3 overall because it didn't arrive as a case, but came in a large box as five reams.  Two had split open (paper was fine).  It works great in my printer.

Price is good but you can practically see through it, won't order again. Probably good for some applications. A lot of reviewers seem to like it fine.

I bought this paper to use in my monthly A5 planner. There quite a lot of sheets with an odd crimp line in it, about every 3rd or 5th sheet. Since I will recycle the pages when I am done, I still cut it in half for my planner and printed my pages out. It is only mildly annoying that I can see the odd crimp lines  The overall quality is just okay. I've purchased better quality from Hammermill before and was disappointed with this pack. I will need to buy from a different company to use in my crochet pattern binder. The fold/crimp lines are too noticeable for more permanent items.

I thought I was buying regular letter-sized paper, so I was really disappointed to discover that I had not.  I know that this is my problem, not there's so I probably should not mark them down on the overall rating.

I needed them for personal printing so I'm not too worried about the thing pages, but I would be too embarrased to print a report or another important document for other people on these pages. For the price, I wasn't expecting great quality so I'm not disatisfied with the order, but will defenitely not recommend them for heavy duty printing. They would be great for tracing or throw away pages.

Bought this to avoid having to go to the store during Black Friday as I was low on printer paper for the weekend. BIG mistake. I didn't pay close enough attention to the fact this is A4. Paper is good quality, but everything else I own is 8.5 x 11. Guess I'll be heading to the store anyway. Good news is I only wasted $4.45

As with Ice Cream and coffee to name a few, this company along with other paper companies is practicing deceptive advertising/sells.They are selling 400 sheets of paper as a "REAM" when in the past the ream measured 450 to 600 sheets."This ream of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) is also known as a 'long' ream, and is gradually replacing the old value of 480 sheets, now known as a 'short' ream. Reams of 472 and 516 sheets are still current, but in retail outlets paper is typically sold in reams of 500." unk source!No more shall I pontificate on this subject.

It wasn't clear that this is not standard size paper we use in the U.S it longer and slightly narrower.

this paper is see through, I bought it because I needed paper to print stuff at home to study with so its not something I'm using for professional purposes but when i compare it to the printer paper from the library that printer paper has such a better quality its thicker than this paper, this paper i can see my notes on the other side, not great paper if you want to print on both sides or print something that looks "professional" but thankfully I'm only using this stuff at home

About 1/3 of the sheets were damaged in shipping (bent long edge and corner). There was no padding in the box it was delivered in. The other 2/3 of the sheets are good.

This paper is kinda thin which I can see through which I didn't expect, and sometimes it causes too much trouble for my printing (jams), I have always liked the Hammermill brand and I've been using their paper for a long time, but this is the first time I bought this type of paper and I really don't like the quality of it. But this paper price is fairly cheaper than most of the A4 paper brands out there, so that's a plus.

There is color difference between this paper and staples printing paper. This one gives yellow shade. Also a bit expensive comparing to others.

The paper is fine, but it’s too wide.  It’s about an 1/8th inch wider than standard paper and was difficult to fit in my printer.  I have to put one or two pages in at a time or my paper jams.  I need the paper or I would return it.

The size of paper = 8.28 x 11.69 .  I had to adjust the width of my printer paperfeed.  Problem is = printer often thinks there is no paper in feeder cuz dimensions of paper is odd .

You can very easily see through the paper if you print double-sided. I wish it wasn’t so hard to find premium A4 paper in the US

Ordered A4 but was sent legal, which is longer and cannot fit many of my files, I am left with a load of papers which need to used for something

The quality is fine but the size is off. It says on package 8.5x11 but it’s 8.25 x 12” and that’s not a size they offer. Have to buy a different brand because it is too long and we need to be uniform with what we already have

Well, the paper was good but it arrived with an open package and the box beat up like crazy and half opened on the top

Packages were all broken upon arrival. Paper inside are fine. Looks like they need to pack them more carefully.

The second pack of paper has this issue, we didn't open it until more than 30 days after purchase.

Same price as the office supply stores, but through Amazon, it was delivered right to the door. Used a ream over the past week with no jams or problems. Otherwise, right size, white, plain old copy paper.*Update and downgrade - used about 300 sheets, two pieces of paper go through about every 5th or 6th copy on my old HP2100 printer. This hasn't happened before, and I don't think it's the printer.

It is a light grey not white!!!!!

Was surprised how thin it was, but for the price, I can’t complain.

It's decent paper, but seems awful thin to be 20# paper. Also, the size is not standard.

My first order I received the package was opened and had been taped shut so I asked for a replacement to insure that I was getting the 500 sheets I am paying for and the replacement arrived open as well.

The Ream of paper was 11.75" tall instead of  STANDARD 11.5" tall causing paper jambs. HELP!

Pay attention this is not 8 1/2 x 11 standard paper

I am very disappointed to find that "20 lb." paper (which means that 3 reams should weigh over 60 lbs.) is more like 10 to 15 pounds. The only reason why I didn't give it fewer stars is that I haven't yet used it and it may work satisfactorily. I think that the company should be honest about the properties of their product.

the thinness of the paper.  Also it was delivered to Post office box which is a long way from office; as this box was quite heavy, we would prefer in the future it being delivered to our office suite as before. thanks you

The picture of the paper made it look like it was a normal size box of printer paper, rather than a box with only three packs of paper.

These feel very thin and don’t work well for duplex.  I probably won’t purchase these again, I wouldn’t use it for official use.

The price is good but the paper is very thin and my printer doesn't always detect it.

Paper was crinkled and unable to use for printing. The original box needs to be bigger. All packages were ripped open and the last package at the bottom looked like the picture shown.

This paper is thin and you can see through it if you are printing on both sides.  It also wants to double up paper sometimes triple or more sheets when it is printing out.  I've wasted serveral sheets from it being printed half on two different sheets.

I thoughtbthis was a regular case of paper. No. It is 3 ,500 page packages. I would have not spent this much money on copy paper but its too much trouble to return. Just FYI

This paper is not as thick as other 20 lb paper I've been using. I could definitely tell the difference when I ran out of my oruginal paper and finished printing with this.

What I don’t like about this paper is that it’s thinner than other ordinary printer paper and My markers easily leak through the paper. I do not suggest this paper to artist out there who want to use markers on them.

PAPER IS BRIGHT WHITE.  IT ACCEPTS PRINTING EASILY. THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT I HAVE VERSUS THE PRINTER PAPERS I HAVE BEEN USING IS THAT THIS ONE JUST COLLAPSES ON BOTH SIDE OF THE TRAY HOLDER AFTER PRINTING.  MY HP PRINTER HAS A SINGLE HOLDER IN THE MIDDLE.  BOTH SIDE OF THE PAPER JUST HANG DOWN ON EACH SIDE.

Hey Bezos - ALL LIVES MATTER!!!Hey Bezos - ALL LIVES MATTER!!!Hey Bezos - ALL LIVES MATTER!!!Hey Bezos - ALL LIVES MATTER!!!Hey Bezos - ALL LIVES MATTER!!!

The paper works just fine, but one ream, instead of  being 2 inches thick is 1 3/4 inches thick, so it is short by about 62 pieces of paper.  I can't be bothered to return the whole box because of this, but it isn't right.

good but the package got damaged a bit.. Luckily the paper was ok

I wasn't happy with the quality of the paper. I have always liked Hammermill, so this was a surprise. The paper is 20lb bond but feels thinner. I will not purchase this paper again.

Great for one sided printing, but the paper is pretty see through that it looks bad when you double side print things. Does the job for single side though, so for the price it is not terrible. Decent

Paper itself is good quality, we are using it in laser printer

It's too thin for my liking - you can see through it, but it will do. Quality is great, I just wish it came in a higher weight.

The industry-standard grammage (g/(m^2) (gsm)), is 80g/(m^2), but Hammermill offers only 72g/(m^2) (really 72.5747792g/(m^2) but always round down when computing safety-margins) which is adequate, but flimsy.  The paper usually prints without jamming or mangling, but sometimes, malfunctions.By the way the manufacture does not list the grammage.  I had to compute it myself.  If you check my work and get 290.2991168g/(m^2), you did not make a mistake  ——  ¡the United States of America made a mistake!:In the USA, the weight in pounds for a ream (500 sheets) is the mass of a ream before cutting.  Reams are quartered.  Really, the USA should just adopt ISO-216 and put grammage on the packaging, like in the rest of the world.Tl;DR:72g/(m^2)

The paper is a good grade, and I might have ordered more, but not from here . . . .I ordered 3 packages of 3 reams each- which makes 9 reams, right?  Only received 8 reams all together.  Tried several times to contact Customer Service to correct this and got the run around each time.  Item was marked as being a late shipment when I had already received the 8 reams.  Couldn't get CS to understand that I had received 8 reams and needed one more.  They were mostly stuck on the late delivery.  Problem is still not resolved.

This is a ream of Hammermill-branded Sylvamo paper in A4 size, which is the standard *most* of the world uses but the U.S. does not. I buy A4 because I happen to like the size. Anyhow...I have no real issues with what I received; however, as can be seen from the photos, the ream package was pretty significantly torn open. I left it in the outer clear plastic wrapper so there would be no question this was the condition in which I received it. It's hard to say if this happened at the seller's location or due to shipping, but nevertheless the package was *not* flawless.In the process of writing this review, I have now opened the package, and the paper seems fine. No damage. I'll put it at the top of the stack I've got since it's now pretty much "open".I'm not upset over this; I have plenty of prior experience in printshops handling paper, and so it's not going to be a problem and won't go to waste. These things happen.I'd still do business with this seller again.

It’s printer paper, I print documents on it. Not sure that else there is to say.

The quality of this paper isn't amazing, I'll say that. It's malleable, it's splotchy, it's almost translucent in the wrong light, the print quality is fine, but nothing to put in a television commercial- It's definitely a low end product, but a low end product also means low end prices, and the price is hard to beat, especially when weighed against the other options. I mean, let's be honest, in the United States, the market for A4 paper is extremely limited, as there's no demand for it- letter is the standard here and always will be, the only remotely accessible alternative being legal. There aren't alot of brands that sell A4 copier paper, and those that do, do so at a huge markup. But here we have a perfectly adequate, decently performative A4 copier paper that's available at a competitive price to standard American letter, and, to be completely frank, this is as good as it's going to get. Paper is paper and this is certainly... Paper. The selling point is that Hammermill is not going to price gouge you on this product, and weighed against your other options for A4 in the United States, that is the deal maker.

Always happy with this paper.

Good value for the money

No problems with it.

Nice white print paper that has not jammed or run double sheets at all.  Good quality, just wish it was less expensive.  Recommend.

I've purchased this a few times and it's arrived in good condition and is just fine for a small business that doesn't need bright white or heavier paper. I like to buy in smaller quantities like this because there's not that much storage room here.

wonderful, no paper jams

Really like this paper product,  just need to be sure about quantity.

Overall the product is pretty great, except for the packaging. When I open the box, it’s already ripped off like in the photo

The paper is a nice quality but it’s longer than standard letter size printer paper, just a bit. I don’t do mm and just assumed the size. Price was great and it works in my printer ok but just surprised me. Luckily it’s just for personal use so not a deal breaker.

Just as described …

It's a good bargain for home computer use.

Since I already have it and badly need it I didn’t return the item even though the packing is ripped like pretty much.It’s still clean so I didn’t bother returning it.

The paper is fine- just be aware that it is not standard letter sized paper. It's longer and leaner. Some printers will have an A4 setting, but margins will need to be adapted before you print something if you are using standard settings.

Does what it is supposed to do.

Haven’t had a jam at all. Paper has been feeding reliably well so far. Almost been through the first five hundred and getting ready to break the second five out. Am satisfied with the quality and each piece of paper is just like the last and that’s consistently I like in my printer paper. Four Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!

The color is off-white a bit but you don't notice it unless you are encountering better paper in your daily activities.  I purchased this to print off powerpoints and notes for my masters program.  It is a high volume of printing and I don't need a great quality print out to study and then file these notes within a week or two.  This paper is an economical way for me to have what I need to succeed in school so I would order again when needed.

Product was as expected, however it can the packaging was totally mangled.

I usually love Hammermill. But these? Seemed very very thin and flimsy.I had the SAME paper from a few years ago, and it is definitely better quality.What’s up? Is this the “Amazon special” paper - and why it was on sale?I’ll pay $10 more to get paper that will stand up for a scanner feed. Glad I only bought 3 reams!

Delivery was great on time and product was as described printed well

It wasn't clear to me that I ordered a longer size than what is typically used in the USA. This is not letter size paper.. Otherwise no issues.

arrived with the hammermill packaging torn in several places.  Sheets of paper don't seem damaged.

I have used this brand repeatedly for about two years.  I was amazed immediately by the improved print quality.  It is a bit more than I was accustomed to paying at the grocery store (was paying between $4 and $5 for a ream).  And I like that I can buy three reams at a time (I do a lot of printing).

This is great when you just need cheap paper. It isn’t high quality but as a homeschool mom sometimes my kids just need paper to doodle on or for crafts and this works. For some things we prefer a higher quality paper but this gets the job done for now. Paper is slightly translucent so not the best for dual printing, but again, it’s okay if you don’t mind that, especially if you aren’t using tons of ink.

it is thinner than your average paper, easy to wrinkle, but it is good for printing and such or just doing simple paper airplanes, drawing, or writing.

Came in the usual sturdy box but despite that, the top ream of paper has two corners of the entire pack crumpled (folds). So, it jams in my printer when I print.  It must be from hits and bumps to the box.  Frustrating but what can I do, right?  One star off.  I was thinking of taking two stars off... but for now I have only opened the first ream.

Works fine for home use. Obviously not stationary grade, but very acceptable for various printing and copying chores. Satisfied with the product and the economical price.

Right now we are in our rainy season and going out doesn't really appeal to me for just a ream of paper.SO I CAN GET MY PAPER DELIVERED TO MY FRONT DOOR.The SAME PAPER that I would get at the local store DELIVERED cost is a bit less then the local stationary store, without having to fight for a parking space.

This will do what it is needed for.  The paper is bright white as described. I just became a Notary so I hope I will have to buy a whole lot more soon. Fingers crossed!

This is a good quality of paper and I have bought it twice now.  However, it doesn't qualify as 99.99% jam free in my mind as I've had a couple of jams with it.  Seems to be about the same as other brands in this respect.  However, it is priced right so I'll likely continue to buy it.

The product quality is good, works as described, but why do they sell A4 size in the US?

Really thin not the greatest quality but does the job

Value for $

Paper is longer than normal letter size.  Maybe I just ordered wrong paper?

Printing quality

It works.

Hone and church paperwork

Order in rush but product was delivered next day and it was good.

Copy paper on ink jet isn’t going to be as good as say, ink jet paper or paper with a higher brightness or heavier weight, but it gets the job done if you have basic documents you need to print. Good enough. Was a good buy.

Pleasantly surprised

Great product

Price is great, though the paper does seem a bit  "thinner" as some other reviewers have noted. I held it up to a light to compare and there was a difference.Not a huge issue for what we print, though it might be for someone else.

I did a search for copy paper and this popped up.  Never knew A4 size existed till now. Lesson learned.

Rating: 5/5 stars (would give more if possible)I just used the most incredible, life-altering, and awe-inspiring product - a stack of A4 paper! I mean, where do I even begin?Pros:- It's paper. Like, actual paper. I can touch it, feel it, and even smell that fresh paper scent (don't judge me).- It's A4-sized, because who needs anything else? It's like the Goldilocks of paper sizes - just right.- The stack is so sturdy, I can almost use it as a paperweight (almost).- Perfect for writing, printing, doodling, or creating an epic paper fort (I did that).Cons:- Ran out of product to write this review because I used all the paper.- Now I need to buy more, which is really an investment in my happiness.- May cause excessive paper airplane creation.In conclusion, this A4 paper stack has exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer, a life-changer, and a paper-changer. If you don't have one, what are you even doing with your life? Get yourself a stack (or three) and experience the pure joy of paper!P.S. If anyone needs me, I'll be in my paper fort, surrounded by A4 bliss.(In the words of Shwepps, “It’s paper. What did you expect?)

Prints excellent, dependable product. Will buy again.

I ordered three reams of hammermill paper. It arrived in two days and was priced competitively.

I needed A4 paper for some European documents that wouldn’t fit properly on standard US Letter Size paper.  Hammer I’ll has always made quality paper.

I like the price and quality

Paper is Good!

Good paper for LaserJet printer

My Father's a U.S. Resident. We had to get this size of paper to print documents for his appointment with his home country's consulate outreach mission. While that didn't go as smoothly as we hoped- Hamermill's A4 paper was just what we needed to print the forms he filled-out online. Thus, I give it wholeheartedly a 5-Star rating (and seeing as my Mother's Father was a Papermaker- I know a thing or two about paper!).

This is a very good quality paper that does not get stuck in the printer.  I also love that it comes in a 3 ream pack so I do not have to store the huge box of paper.

I ordered this time after time at the time and have been very satisfied. The only time we order something cheaper I had to almost throw every other piece away because we're jam in my cop I'mier. These have enough heft that through the machine and turn out fine  a letter that needs to be sent to a corporation or keep as a medical record.

The product is fine. Amazon tried to deliver in the middle of the night. Then they finally got the delivery right 24 hours later.

it's paper ,what can you say

The thickness and durability are very good. I particularly like its size as it is really the A-4 size when compared to the usual one, which is a bit wider and longer.

Works great

No any problem

Printer paper is as described. Results in quality print products. Good, heavyweight paper.

Like everything  about itIt's for personal business.

Plain paper for completing work

Great quality

Would buy again.

This copy paper is the best. It doesn't jam up the copier and the copies are always great!

Good paper received promptly.

This is the perfect amount of copy paper for individual use.  I chair a couple of committees and have a small apartment.  With space at a premium, it is wonderful to have a small, compact box arrive with plenty of paper.  The box also is perfect to store items in once it's empty.  Thank you!

Have used this product for years and always pleased with the results

easy too write and take

My home printer is a Canon color laser printer/scanner. Everything I print comes out looking great, and this paper never jams. The paper feels good in the hand, and takes handwriting with pen or pencil perfectly. Love it.

Quality printing. My favorite brand.

This product is absolutely fantastic! It exceeded my expectations in every way. From its superb quality to its outstanding performance, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Truly awesome

This paper is the same as the paper we used when I worked for the State of Michigan. It may or may not cost more, but I personally am very pleased that this company has not reduced its commitment to high quality, as so many other companies have, in order to maximize profits.

It's paper. You can write on it. Use it in a printer. Make a fire with it. Make paper airplanes or cute origami animals, dinosaurs and dragons with it . Don't expect magic, it's paper.😁👍

Good quality paper, Other than that, what can I say about paper

This paper is perfect for laser prints. It has a decent weight and rarely gets stuck in the printer. The 3 pack is perfect for what quantity we print and comes in a nice box suitable to store stuff in.

You need great paper to prepare contracts.  I am very happy with the quality of this paper and being able to have it delivered to my door.

I was able to receive the paper quickly and avoid making a trip to a local store. The paper seems to work just great in my multifunction copier.

It had been awhile since I had bought printer paper and chocked when I saw the price, thank mr president.  It is good paper though.

I needed A4 paper in the US as I had to print some German contracts to be used over there. This paper is perfect. Correct A4 size and perfect quality.

Always order this paper, not too thin, good quality.

For top-notch printing quality and hassle-free usage, Hammermill 20 lb Copy Paper is a clear winner in my book!

Great value for the price.

I have used this brand in both copy machines and printers for years. Excellent quality. This paper does not jam in the printer and looks very good when documents have been printed.

I use this legal-size copy paper to print from a Canon copier. I use approx 50 sheets a week on a church bulletin (double-sided, 1 page). It's perfect for that use. When I print the original bulletin from my home Canon printer, it is VERY crisp and sharp. Too bad that the vendor raised the price by a few dollars--like everything else! So far I've bought 6-9 reams over the past couple years. Good product. I'll buy again, until I can't afford to donate the cost. :)

I was able to order 3 reams without getting a whole case. Cost per page was about the same. Quality was no different.

Many countries in Asia use A4 paper. If you want to mail a contract to them, you'd better use A4 paper. This product is great and meets my expectations.

I recently purchased the Hammermill Printer Paper and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The paper is a perfect weight for printing documents, at 20 lbs it is sturdy enough to withstand multiple prints without tearing or jamming in the printer. The 92 brightness makes the text and images on my documents look crisp and clear, and the 8.5 x 11 size fits perfectly in my printer.I also appreciate that this package includes 3 reams, which means I have a nice supply of paper on hand for all my printing needs. The price is also very reasonable for the quantity and quality of paper that you receive.Overall, I would highly recommend the Hammermill Printer Paper to anyone in need of high-quality copy paper. It has exceeded my expectations and has become my go-to choice for all my printing needs.

This paper proved to be worthy of our laser printer, showing no signs of paper dust that sometimes if found in cheaper grades.  For the price, the set is a bargain.

Paper is paper.

I ordered a ream of A4 paper in order to print out a number of PDF documents that I received from outside the US, and it's perfect. I have some French passes for a historic attraction, some British calendar-a-day layouts, and similar items that end up being a poor fit for Letter-sized sheets.(The paper was loose in a bigger box so the outer wrapper tore during shipping.)

Every ream in the case had glue on the ends of the stack of paper. We always fan the ream before installing in the printer and noticed a LARGE amount on several reams sticking the papers to each other.  A few of them seemed to fan just fine only to have it jam out machines because of the small amount in a corner.  We probably had at least half of the case that had to become scratch paper!!! For a small nonprofit that does a great amount of printing this was very disappointing!

All 10 reams of paper came with ripped reams,  paper exposed. Not sure how this happened but assume that it was like that when boxed.  The outside box was partially open on one end.  I would return it all but paper is somewhat usable, just will not be ordering this again. Keeps jamming in printer.  Can not run more than 4 copies before this happens.  Would not recommend

Compared to my regular HP Copy & Print I've been using for years, this paper has a dull yellowish hue comparable to cheap recycled paper with the same texture. I called Hammermill and they said this is 92 brightness, but I was confusing brightness with whiteness. I think they are confused, if not deceptive.

We ordered for our office / Business. The price point was wonderful. Once they arrived, we clearly regretted our decision. The box was damaged paper had a somewhat of a bend to paper. therefore, caused issues in all printers. In conclusion we rather pay the higher price for straight not damaged printer paper.

Package arrived but the box was torn. Inside, every ream of paper had been affected. The paper covering the reams was torn and in many cases, the paper inside has a blue residue from its packaging.

We have had multiple reams from hammermill and regularly have sheets that have brittle lines in them, dark areas etc.The first time it happened, we just thought maybe it was an anomaly.But we can no longer rely on hammermill.  We regularly print large real estate signing packages and having to sort through and reprint select pages due to sub-quality paper is just not worth.Avoid.

This paper was terrible. I have purchased the exact same Hammermill paper in the past. This time the paper arrived in a box that was taped shut like it had fallen apart. Upon opening the box, all 12 reams of paper were encased in sleeves that were ripped or torn, almost as if they were reused. The paper is extremely thin. In the printer, the paper rolls up, causes jams, and more than 1 page pulls through the printer. I am incredibly frustrated with this purchase. I will never purchase it again.

Very very disappointed I got my box of Hammermil paper reams in and the box was not busted up at all but every single team of paper was busted open!!! I bought these for my grandchildren to carry to school as part of their school supplies needed now I had to put rubber bands around each ream and going to have to buy the great big zip loc bags to send each one in. Very disappointed don’t waste your money on this mess!

Bought a case of 6 reams. Most of the reams have been glued together. Causes paper jams. No issues on the cases prior to this one. Will try a different brand next time.

BOX was in terrible shape and ALL REEMS were broke open and paper was discolored possibly from the box getting wet.  This is a decent amount of money paid for this product to have it arrive in this condition, box was all taped up,as well.  I thought about returning this (which really is what should have happened.  However, to return this would be a pain since we would need to bring to a UPS dropbox (HEAVY BOX), without paying for return shipping. I feel as though a credit of some sort would be the right thing.

We have ordered this product several times and with this latest order we noticed the paper was super thin compared to the remaining paper that was in our copier.  We always order "Hammermill Printer Paper, 20 lb Copy Paper, 8.5 x 11 - 8 Ream (4,000 Sheets) - 92 Bright, Made in the USA"  We checked and double checked to see if we accidently ordered the wrong weight.  We did not.  Today we just printed some new forms for our office and its blatantly obvious the difference in the paper quality compared to the previously printed forms.  The reams are labeled 20lb weight but obviously its not.  We will not be ordering this again.

The package arrived 6 days late and was damaged.  The box was missing its lid, so the top two reams of paper were damaged and unusable.

Unable to print on both sides - the paper is so thin that if you print on both sides it is hard to read because the print comes through on both sides. Also very flimsy.

I'm not sure what the problem is with this paper, but I'm guessing the price is low because it is a factory reject. The paper creases in my Xerox printer. I change it to another brand of paper and I don't have that problem.

This paper seriously jams our printer every 5 sheets. We have had the servicer out and the printer is in top shape. When we load paper from another brand it doesn't jam. Just this stuff. Cannot even continue to use. box of paper was shipped inside a way bigger box and all came pretty crushed because of that.

We ordered two boxes with 8 reems of paper; however, one of the boxes was missing a reem and all the other reems were torn

i love amazon but, who leaves a case of paper outside on the porch in the pouring rain?not a good move.as to the product, we use it all the time.

After opening the printer paper box, this is how the paper looked inside. One pack was just thrown in and all of the corners were damaged. All of the remaining packs were opened. I will NEVER order paper online again.

Several packs of paper were open, bent all up, and then TAPED back together which may them not useable. Not ordering this kind anymore.

All of the paper is stuck together - and it jams my printer! First time this has ever happened.

I have been purchasing Hammermill printer paper for my two printers for many years.  I use so much paper because I make art project for my stepdaughters' 3rd grade class in Nevada.  I am in Oregon and ship the projects for each of them to complete.  When I found out they had no budget for the arts, and I am retired and had taught art here it would be a win-win.  I have loved doing this and even got on Zoom with the kids.  It's been good for all around.  It serves a need in today's society.  Anyway, I started to order a new supply of paper for the holiday projects, come to see the price had literally DOUBLED.  I am disappointed to say the least.  The price went from 45.00 to 82.00.  I can't continue at this rate and will have to look for other outlets to buy the paper for the kids.  ALSO, get this.  MADE IN THE USA.  Can't say we didn't try to stay here when we buy.

What I was sent is 11.5 inches.  Description and photos all say 8.5 x 11 inches.  This paper is a half an inch too long!

All the reams were torn and had been wet. This paper caused a machine repair. Manufacturer is fine. The handling from the reseller is the problem.

I bought this paper twice. I used my dash button. The price did increase from the first time I purchased this box of paper. Not an issue there. What I'm pissed off about it that the paper quality is bad... The nicest word I can think of. The paper I received last time was a different weight then what is currently in this box. With the other paper could print on both sides without seeing through to the other side. This paper you can see through, curls and warps. It does not lay flat because of how thin it is. I'm sure this works great for some people. I need it in the classroom and it is distracting for the kids to see the ink from the other side. Now I don't know what I had received the last time. I don't know if that box was a mistake or if this box was the mistake. The packaging on this one matches the description. I have used up the other paper so I don't have any packaging to compare to beyond the "reorder this item" feature here on Amazon. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I'm very frustrated! I will have to use twice the amount of paper because I can't do the two-sided prints.

I've been buying this paper for my office for quite some time and I was convinced that I made a mistake in ordering because the last couple of cases I ordered contained paper that was unreasonably thin. We couldn't even hand patients paperwork without to paper bending from being so thin.Absolutely disappointed with this company. Will be buying different brand from a different seller.

I’ve bought this multiple times, and it was always fine but the last box I got (8 reams) the paper constantly jams in three different printers that never had problems with jamming before.  Not sure what’s happened but seems some quality change issue.  Won’t buy again.

Been ordering this paper, 3 boxes at a time, for months.  Never had an issue.  Lately, the paper is rolling up on itself as it exits the printer and the paper feels and looks very thin compared to paper in other boxes from same order.  Not sure what the problem is.  Cancelled auto-ship and looking for a replacement.

The boxes were damaged and opened/ split on bottom. The papers were ripped but enough are okNever ordering paper again

The box and paper were damaged when they arrived.  Every ream was damaged!

I have never had more trouble with printer paper.  I have a HP Laserjet Pro 200 color MFP printer.  It is jamming in the output tray 50% of the time.  I have get up, walk around my desk, open the output tray in back of the printer, remove the jammed piece of paper, close the door, and the printer finishes printing my document.  I have owned this printer for years and have been purchasing and using the Hammermill Premium Color Copy Paper and using it with no problems.  However, with the cost for a 500 sheet ream $15+, I wanted to try a cheaper brand since 90% of what I print is for myself and does not have to look good.  I am on my first ream and have 7 more reams to go!

I'm not sure exactly what's going on with this company, but the last two shipments our office has received has been the thinnest and most flimsy paper I've EVER seen in my life. I'm convinced this is a "bait and switch" because this could not possibly be the Hammerhill I have known and loved.  I've even had people outside our office, pick up a piece of this paper and ask, "what is this?" It's simply terrible. It feels cheap, looks cheap, and prints horribly. We are so disappointed and plan to switch to another brand ASAP. We are tired of getting HAMMERED!

This paper used to be good to use, but now it jams almost every time I try to use it for printing.  I saw a few similar recent reviews which makes me think the paper quality has changed.  My return window closed before I could start using the paper to find out that it was no good, so I can't return it.  Save yourself the headache and buy a different product.

The paper was received in a regular box and not the paper box.  All the packs were open and some of the reams were not in a pack.Very disappointed.

The papers came in a broken box. It was held together with tape. The individual reems of paper was also teared up. Real POOR quality. And reason I didn't return it was because we ran out of paper. But never again will I order from them again.

Paper was poorly packaged. Came in a large Amazon box with little padding, and it must have moved around inside the box during shipping, with some substantial damage to the corners and top, which damaged a good amount of sheets. On top of that, it does not feed well in printer because the paper is not flat. Either it was not stored properly or was damaged inside the box, the entire ream is wavy as shown on picture. I was saving $3 compared to my local office supply store, but the quality and headaches are not worth the saving. Will request a replacement, hoping the next ream is on better shape.

Item was supposedly "new" yet the box had been opened and every single packet of paper was ripped open.  One ring of paper had no wrapping whatsoever...papers bent/folded, and every single packet has blue ink stain on the paper.  Horrible quality.

I just received this shipment and am completely disgusted by how this item arrived. I'll be surprised if any of it ends up being usable. 1 star rating because it wouldn't let me give 0.

You are better off getting a FULL box of paper at the store. This box is less than the box you are used to getting and probably expecting because you are not reading the fine print. The paper is okay, not great (unless you are used to Costco paper, in which case it is - in comparison - great but that is not saying much as Costco's paper is so low quality you can't use it except for copies of documents you will never give a client). Overall if you like a value for your money, like I do, you won't be happy you made this choice, and sort of kick yourself for not seeing that you get less paper than a full box, but for the same or higher price.

I have always used Hammermill paper, and I was surprised to see how poor the quality is with this. I had a 5 year old laser printer that worked like a champ. All of a sudden, every few pages would come out crinkled. I do a lot of printing of materials that must be sorted alphabetically, so I was frustrated by having to reprint random pages and re-alphabetize them manually. I suspected it might be the paper as I never had this problem before. I contacted the printer company, and they told me that the fuser roller was defective and that it can be replaced, but the cost was more than what a new printer would cost. I installed my new printer, relieved that I could start printing normally again. The third page came out crinkled. And the same behavior is happening, where every few pages comes out crinkled. I bought a ream of paper by a different manufacturer and none of the pages come out crinkled. I am very disappointed, and I have several reams remaining that are unused and can't be used.

I bought this  Hammermill paper because of the low price.  I have two printers, a Xerox laser printer and a Brother inkjet.  Normally they very, very seldom jam.  Not with this paper!  While printing a single long document on either printer, it's a constant round of print a few  pages, clear the jam, print a few more pages, clear the jam, print a few more pages, clear the jam.  Sometimes it's print one page, clear the jam, print another page, clear the jam.  Then of course I have to very carefully examine every page in every document to  see which pages were jammed/destroyed and therefore have to be reprinted.  Of course some of those new pages jam, and I have to reprint them yet again. Did I mention that if I print a long document I like to go away, do something else, and come back when the document is printed?  Rather than standing over the printer and minding a 300-page job every second?  This paper is a nightmare to use.

I have ordered this product multiple times. Although the description states 20lb copy paper, this is much thinner than the last orders. I still have some reams of the old paper and there is a noticeable difference. Won't order again.

I previously had this paper which I found to be of high quality.  Unlike other paper that I had, I did not have a single jam for the entire 5,000 sheet case.  However, I just took deliver of the "same" paper, and it is NOT the same.  As others have noted, it is thinner and it immediately jammed in my printer.  I will be returning it, but my greater concern is that it is not 20lb paper as represented.  The packaging is misrepresenting what is inside.  Also, I should have had a heads up as every ream had a tear in the wrapping.

I disliked that only 7 packs of 500 were in the big box.

When we opened the box we discovered one ream of paper was missing and 2 other reams were damaged. We keep these in stock so didn't notice it until after the return date.  Check your paper as soon as it comes in to make sure nothing is damaged inside the box.

Box and paper damaged

Based on the condition of the box and the product inside it looks like the entire box a submerged in water. The outer wrapping on each pack of paper is bleeding through to the product it is supposed to be protecting.

Need paper for printer and 2 reams are damaged

I ordered this paper and when I opened the box it was delivered in, more than half of the packages were already ripped open. The papers seemed fine except for being dirty on the edges. I thought I could deal with it, but as I start putting it into my printer I noticed the paper is very very thin, almost see through. Very disappointing when you pay so much money you want good quality stuff. Also, it jammed my printer 5 times, probably because it’s so thin.

Usually I do not write reviews for office products.  Rather I write book reviews.  However this is one of the exceptions.  Why? Because this paper is horrible and I don't want other potential buyers to be stuck with a box of it like I am.  I don't feel like I can return it because I already opened the box and started using a ream of it.Why is it bad paper?  It is flimsy.  It is see through.  It feels and looks like cheap paper.  I am a business owner who uses a decent amount of paper.  Some of that paper is sent to clients in the form of letters and legal documents.  This paper screams cheap and unprofessional and that is bad for business.  Therefore I am now stuck with reams and reams of scratch paper.

half of the reams are damaged, cant use the paper

The paper is a little thin but works for us.  We go through a lot of paper in this office.  I have ordered the same paper several times in the past I have always received boxes where maybe 6 reams are open, but it worked this time, I took a picture of what was shipped.  Needless to say, I will not be ordering this paper any longer.

I am very disappointed with my purchase. The boxes look like it went through some throwing. When I opened two of the boxes, some of the rims were ripped, and the paper were stained.

Every 4-5 sheets has an inlaid crease.  First time I've tried this brand - will switch back to previous brand.

It's a box of printer paper (10 reams) but my low rating is because all of the reams were torn open (see pics).  In some cases, the paper was falling out as I lifted the ream out of the box.  At first, I thought one or two could have been damaged in packing but ALL 10 reams were torn open.  The box was intact. So seems that they were packed and sent this way which was disappointing.

I ordered two reams which I'm using for printed brochures which when folded in half are 8.5" x 11" in size. The first ream had no problems. As I began folding sheets from the second ream I started having extremely frustrating issues with the creases. After lining up the width edges and folding down the crease I would experience drastic warping, crinkling, and bunching. After testing a few blank sheets it's become clear to me that the bottom (length) edges do line up, but reveal a massive cutting error from the manufacturing process. 2 stars because one ream was delivered as advertised

All packages had bent corners due to poor packaging.  4 reams of legal paper is heavy and should be boxed.

Opened box 1 ream paper manu no good .. never had issues before but lately it seems every order

The media could not be loaded.
                



All 10 reams of this box of paper were busted open.  Just terrible.Some were really bad like attached.

Something is very wrong with this paper. I bought 5 boxes (50 reams total) for my company and literally every ream we tried resulted in a paper jam. There did not seem to be anything wrong with the paper. It was neat and without imperfections and they were all wrapped in the poly wrap that it came in. But it just kept jamming the printer. Sometimes we would get multiple jams per ream, much less one in 10,000, which I will go over in a bit.Our company prints up to 4000 pages in a business day so paper is very important, and as you can imagine it becomes very annoying to clear multiple paper jams in a day when every ream has at least one jam. This should be called the Bob Marley of paper... because it's always Jammin.Attached are printouts of the print error activities. All of the jam events were from this Hammermill paper. We switched back to other paper that we got and everything was fine.When the paper actually does cycle and print, it looks as you would expect. Nothing special about its brightness or print quality, especially since we are printing on an enterprise HP printer.I reached out to Hammermill to see if they would honor the jam free guarantee that you see in the images and on the packaging itself, which states: "no more than one jam in 10,000 sheets or we'll replace the paper or refund the pruchase price." No response in 3 weeks. So I have recycled what we have left and have gone to a different brand. We will just buy from another brand and never from Hammermill again.

The box was damaged. All wrapper of the individual paper reams were not sealed.

The print outs look opaque on this paper, and the finish of the ream is very poor and some papers are even dirty...

4 packs came defective. Pages were glued together :(I thought it was just one pack but a total of 4 packs came this way. Waste of paper.

I've been buying paper like this for 35 or so years now for my small business. I never thought it was possible to screw up basic white copy/printer paper. This feels heavier (although it can't be!) and coarser. It does not handle as easily - sheet by sheet, etc. - as all the other paper I have ever bought or used. It curls annoyingly after laser printing so a small pile's corners are half an inch in the air, catching on things. It is slightly rough to the touch, where usually this kind of paper is smooth.It just "feels" wrong. I wish i could quantify that.Edit note: I just confirmed this by buying a ream of budget paper at a local department store. It is smooth to the touch and easier to handle in the same way that this paper is not.Oh well, at least it will be easy to give away.

Papers were cut incorrectly. We have hundreds of misprints due to the paper not being cut properly by the company.

This is A4 paper but it doesn't fit a standard printer its in mm and is too big. It isn't 8.5 x 11. We don't have anything in the office that this paper will fit what a waste

This is more of a review of Amazon's shipping than the actual product, but since Amazon is the seller & shipper, this is the only review option I have. The paper itself is typical. Ordinary 20lb copy paper, nothing special - and it is basically as expected.However, it was packaged in a very thin plastic bag/envelope. While the flimsy outer packaging stayed closed and no product was able to slip out - the 'shrink wrap' paper-wrapper broke apart and the copy paper was spewed about. A lot of it was creased, almost crumpled. It's definitely worth the extra buck or two to buy locally and be certain to get an undamaged product. I will not order this from Amazon again.

I order a lot of paper with the same specs for general office use....20lb paper at 92 brightness.  I used to only order Georgia Pacific Spectrum, but it seems like there's been a shortage on that over the past year.  That was great paper!  Since then I've tried several other brands, and this is by far the worst.  There's no way this is 20lb paper.  You can very easily see through it and clearly read the text on the next page....it's very thin.  It also NOT 92 brightness.  When held next to the same spec. paper from the other brands I have laying around, it's significantly darker, and text/images are much lower quality when printed in the same laser printer.The value isn't horrible for the quantity of paper you get, but just be aware it's a much lower grade paper than advertised.  So far I have not had any jam issues or wrinkles like others have reported.

Good value but be ware this is think/flimsy paper like low end copy paper.

There is a reason this paper is priced as low as it is....it's cheap paper.  If you print more than 10 pages, it jams.  I rather spend more money and less time clearing jams in my printer.  I know it's the paper because the jams started as soon as I started using this cheap paper.  Save yourself some headaches and look somewhere else for printer paper.

We have been ordering this paper for quite some time at work and it seems to be getting worse. There are weird oil like stains on the paper. At first we thought someone had spilled food on it, but it was in multiple reams. It was also in multiple orders. The quality of the paper is just not good. It has also started getting jammed in our copiers. And sometimes, sections of paper in the middle of unopened reams are all bent. We have always just kind of used whatever copy paper and never had a problem with different brands until we got to this one. This is noticeably poor. Would not recommend.

The paper is fine when I can get it to go through either of my printers without jamming.  I have a laser printer and an inkjet - both completely different styles and brands.  A few pages come through fine, but then it will either jam completely (my laser printer) or multiple pages will come through all together making the print spread out a few lines a piece on multiple pages and eventually leading to 4-6 pieces curled up inside my inkjet printer.  It is impossible to smooth out all the curled up pages to be able to try to put them through again, so I am loosing use of roughly 50% of the paper in my first ream.  I am really disappointed but really can't lug this heavy box by myself back to the post office to try to return it.  I wish I had tried the smaller box.

Been buying this exact paper for years for our company. The last batch was different. The weight/brightness/specs were all the same as before but was noticeably thinner quality, more obvious bleed when double sided printing, and flimsy, almost like newspaper. The difference was so significant I thought I'd purchased the wrong paper. Will not be buying again.

I am finally using the last ream of this paper.  I have used this brand before and it has never had rough/uneven edges.  I've had plenty of problems with it and don't recommend purchasing.  Also, the price now is more than TWICE what it was when I bought it last year.

This paper is noticeably yellowed - very disappointed in the quality

Were supposed to get 10 reams and got 8.

Have bought the 4000 sheet box twice now for our small office, and this second time in particular I keep noticing how much variation there seems to be in sheet thickness and that we get a fair number of creased pages through our printers. Obviously variation in thickness is going to be a very small measurement! But it is noticeable. Our first shipment seemed to arrive unscathed but the second came with the majority of the ream wrappers broken open, which may contribute to the creasing in the machines. (It doesn't jam, just sometimes makes a crease.) My guess is this paper is manufactured to hit a price point more than a quality point, perhaps a line specific to Amazon. It is not labeled or marketed as the same Copy Plus line that Hammermill sells elsewhere.

Several ream of the paper were crunched, crinkled and wrinkled to the point of not being usable at all.

I never write reviews on anything, but this paper is not good. It sticks together. Some items print half on one page and half on another. Also, at the end of my printing a document there may be 5 blank pages in the document stack.  Very unsatisfied.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will certainly not buy this produce again.

This is not the first time we ordered this paper but it is the first time that packaging was terrible.  A  lot of the paper was damaged.  We did not send it back because the paper that wasn't damaged was OK and it would not have been worth the effort to do a return.

looked like a fork lift ran into the box...one of the packs were damaged...but other packs not...so decided not to return...to much hassle...

Paper seems flimsy and thin, nothing like what a 20lb piece of paper should feel like.  Did I measure it, no, is all the other paper in my office 20lb, yes.  Does this seem to be the same density and weight, no.

it was a heavy  box but it still should arrive in excellent condition.  The box was obviously manhandled during shipping and there was no support or interior box support in the much larger box it was shipped in,  really badly done.  Second box with bad packaging this  week.

Product was in terrible shape. Band missing from box. Paper packeting broken on all reams. Looked as if it was a returned item stored and sold again. Also this product was sitting outside my door. I was not home when delivered and I live alone. Delivery driver claims it was hand delivered which is not true.

The paper is fine for general printing, but please note, if you, like I, were drawn to it because of the Climate Friendly Pledge, please note that the paper itself is wrapped in NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC.  For that very reason, we will not be purchasing again as it completely negative any positive impact the paper itself had on sustainability.

This copy paper sticks together and sometimes prints the image on half of 2 pages or pulls 2 pages and skips the page I'm trying to print on. It will also jam the printer because of multiple pages being pulled at once.I use this in multiple machines and it has the same problem regardless of the machine.I also tried fanning the bundle of paper before putting it in the paper tray.The paper I was using before the did not give me this problem.

I thought the price was great. But when I got it and printed a page or two with this paper the ink can be so heavy on it that I was afraid it was gonna rip through. This is not great to print. Maybe draw if not using a lot of ink on it but to print out a page essay is not the thing for me. Not happy at all with the thickness of this paper. It can do better as paper weight.

Paper curls up in printer and cause to jam printer

The box was damaged on the corner, therefore two packs of papers were damaged.  Paper was bent on the corners.  Could not use in the printer.

Each sheet of paper has small grease spots on it all over. Picture shows it when I hold it up to the light.My staff is embarrassed to hand reports to customers on this paper as it looks like they mishandled it or set it on a greasy surface. All will be used for scrap paper since we cant return it.

I've reordered this paper several times, but something has changed. Its too slippery. When I print sometimes there are blank pages between printed pages. Sometimes a page will start partially down the page. Printed pages curl upwards around the edges. And I have to help the paper through the feeder when scanning. I will be looking for a different product the next time I order.

I purchased 10 reams x 3 and the paper is great! I took one star away due to the quality of how these items were packaged. it seems like the boxes themselves broke and there was tape used to maintain its figure, the other two stars are deducted because 2/3 boxes came with 9 instead of 10 reams! I would like to know where the other 2 reams went?In total I received 28 reams when 30 was the purchased amount.Thus resulting in 2 stars.

The print quality seems to be fairly good.  A couple pages in each ream have creases at the top left.  Paper could be made of oil.  Price has tripled since I bought it last.  Guess I need to shop around.

I have purchased this paper before and it was OK- 3-4 starThis time the box was damaged and wrapping torn. The first 40 or so pages had bent corners and delivery was slower than I would have gotten elsewhere. Not returning because I need it but probably not purchasing again.

We have ordered this same copy paper in the past. Compared to our previous order, this paper is thinner and flimsier. It does not seem like the same weight paper at all!

this paper is so thin, i can see through to anything printed on back side. you get what you pay for, i guess.  disappointed. in pic you can see the table on the other side of this paper showing through quite easily.

These reams are wrapped in plastic.  If you store them in a high humidity area, the glue from the plastic will come off and the sides of the paper will be exposed.

In at least two of the reams, there is torn paper peppered throughout it. At first, I thought that there was something wrong with my printer, but then I realized that it was the paper itself. I don't have time to sort through hundreds of pieces of paper to make sure that I take out all of the ripped paper, so I basically have two reams of scrap paper.

This jams a lot in the printer.  No other paper I ever used jams in this printer.  It is soft and curls up at the edges, which I suspect is causing the jams.  Never seen paper like this.  It just seems to be lacking the structure needed to be fed through printers.

These were delivered today and had I not had a client come in and tell us they were on the wet front porch in the snow... they would have been ruined.  There is nothing wrong with the product itself, however, you need to have people walk inside the front door rather than leaving the PAPER in the wet snow to be damaged.  It was the middle of the day and my business was open.

This is basic printer paper. Works well, no smudging or paper jams. A good value at this price. 5 Stars and I do recommend this item.I write honest reviews based on real life experience with each item to help others make informed purchases. I read reviews too, and appreciate how helpful they can be. I hope that you find this review helpful!

I got the 8.5x11 20lb Copy paper in the 8-ream box, and it met my expectations for simply being standard printer paper like you'd expect and have had ZERO problems with them feeding or printing from my printers, single or double-sided.  The paper is just regular light paper, doesn't seem too thin or cheap.  Its as pliable as wrapping paper, and not a thick card stock.  I filled my tray in my HP LaserJet Pro MFP M477fdw to the brim, and have been printing for standard home office use, usually double-sided, and never having a problem or second thought about the paper quality.  I don't get any unreasonable bleed through other than what you would expect to faintly notice on two sided printing if there is light beneath the paper.After looking through a lot of choices online, and reading reviews of every brand and variant, all of which with some scary reviews out there, I gave this a try, hoping for just decent standard printer paper that works.  None of the fearful review claims came true for me.  Not unexpectedly thin.  Zero jamming for me.  I like that it comes in a convenient box for easy ream storage, shipped to your front door, and a pretty decent value.  If I had one complaint, is that the paper wrapping on the reams themselves is thin and tears easily on the sides when the ream flexes as you pick them up.  It doesn't really matter as the box itself is protective.  But a thicker ream wrapping paper would feel more sturdy and protective.  But I do like the paper sleeves as they are easier to use a partial ream than the store-bought clear plastic sleeves that shred to pieces when opened.Personally, I've had some thicker paper before that feels more sturdy and rigid than this.  I've had GP paper that I just loved because it felt so sturdy and worked as well, and I've had some HP paper from a local store that felt like stronger card stock.  I thought I had 20lb paper before, but maybe it was heavier stock.  I wouldn't say this feels "premium" in nature.  But as 20lb copy paper, I don't think I can expect more than being what it stated, arriving in good condition, and just working.  Although it is hard to say I "love" this paper, there are no flaws to knock off a star in my book.  If you really want a paper to feel more rigid than regular paper, I think you simply have to go >20lbs card stock.

Good quality paper at a reasonable price

Best way to buy in bulk at a very reasonable price. Very good quality paper.

Great quality paper. Hardly to never any paper jams.

The paper is used for a business, and I noticed the consistency seemed much thinner.  But it gets the job done and didn't rip so that is all that matters and a good price.

After years of use with this brand even though I can get cheaper brands, I stick with it since I have yet to have had any jams

This is a review of paper. You can print on it or draw on it if you wish. I'm not a connoisseur but this seems just as fine as competitors paper.

My mistake. I thought I was buying a single team of paper, whereas I bought a real BOX of of eight reams. Duh, it will take me a decade to use that amount of paper.

I needed a large format paper.  This is fine.  Next time I will shoot for one with a better printing outcome.  Something that will help the image pop more.  This is a bit dull.  Inexpensive though, and handles the ink well so no complaints.

Normally I would give a 4 star rating on most of the Hammermill Printer Paper.  Usually most of the reams have a small amount of ripped, package covers, but no paper damage.  This time I'm giving a 2 star rating.  I ordered two, 8 ream boxes. One box was as usual, ripped package covers.  In the other box, all 8 reams of paper had much more than usual damage to the package covers.  Although there is not significant damage to the paper itself, it is disappointing that the box of reams came in such bad shape.

I love this paper. Not a fan of the price. But it is what it is. My problem is that it came already opened!!! When I pulled it out of the Amazon plasticky envelope, the paper was open, as seen in the picture.

This paper is great.  We've ordered it before.  The delivery service should have put it in a plastic bag - instead it was wet and some of the paper ruined by the time we got home from work.

I got this paper thinking that Hammermill would be a good brand.  The paper is bright white and came in good condition, but once I started printing on it, I noticed that it feels noticeably different that the 20lb paper I used just before it.  It is a very light paper - feels maybe like an 18 lb. paper.  I've already started using it, and I hate to return so heavy an item.  Hence I will keep it, but I am disappointed in how thin it feels.

Received 10 reams of paper and all packages were torn in multiple places.

I would have given a 5 star rating but the carton was in a box that didn’t fit tight and allowed the carton to shift, move around and get bent in transport.  This caused every ream to burst their wrapper and bend to some degree. See photo of one of the reams.I removed them from the Hammermill carton and salvaged the individual reams and will be able to to use the paper for personal use.If I had been ordering for a business office where the reams would be unpacked and dispersed through out the facility, I would have requested a return and refund as this isn’t an acceptable delivery condition for copy paper to be used in many different printer models by several different people.The carton appears to be scaled down to fit 8 and not the usual 10 reams and it is too small to protect the paper as the top barely locked onto the bottom and it was only banded across the waistline of the carton and when picked up by the band, it allowed the carton to twist contributing to the bursting of the ream wrappers.Pricing was excellent but delivery condition very disappointing as the paper is subject to dirty edges if not stored carefully.

usable I just dont think it worth the price

Ordered ten cases of paper, and when I received the ten cases, about five of them the boxes were badly damaged.  The paper was still inside the boxes and some of the rims of the packaging were damaged also.

When this arrived, I thought what was I going to do with this small package of paper. My mistake I didn’t realize it was half the box I usually purchase. The price for this half box of paper is insane. I could have purchased 10 reams of paper for roughly the same price. Again, my mistake but won’t be purchasing this box again. Lesson learned

I received this paper weeks late and it arrived opened and out of the package I haven’t used it yet but just the idea of how it arrived was a little upsetting

DID'T Notice it was only 5 reams! It was not that great of value!!

This paper jams constantly. It’s annoying

I was disappointed with this brand because every package of paper I open has paper that is wrinkled on the ends. Not all paper is wrinkled but enough so you have to examine each pack. And if you are printing off an important document you don't want to submit it with wrinkled paper. I bought this brand because of price but I will not buy it again. I will stay with Georgia-Pacific paper.

Paper is great but delivered to someone up the street and no picture sent to show it was at the wrong home. When the numbers on the house don’t match the numbers on the box please keep driving to get to the right place so those match.

Just an inconvenience. Really needed this copy paper today. It arrived in tatters, outside package and inside including all reams of paper. Initiated the return process which requires me to pack it all back and wait. Still need to buy paper locally at disadvantaged price in the interim.

At least on my brother printer, the toner does not stay on well.  With enough resistance or moisture you will see the toner fading substantially, whereas using some printer paper 20 years old the toner stays on fine.I wonder however the "copy paper" title on the reams means it is more rated for a copier than a laser printer.  I gave it 3 stars if it works well for copiers, not sure.

The only issue I would point out was the packaging. It came in a box that was too big and not stuffed enough to keep the paper from shifting around inside which led to a few creases and other slight damage to the paper. But nothing bad enough to warrant a return. Otherwise. It’s paper!!

both the paper wrapping and the inner box were torn appart and outer box looked like it was run over with a truck

I open this big box and has paper torn open and all over the place.

It took over 2 months to receive this item - Ridiculous! When it did arrive - the bow was crushed at one corner - Manufacturer should have used a much stouter box, or simply shipped it within another box for protection! I do not recommend!

This is labeled “printer paper” on Amazon, but is prominently labeled “copy paper” on the product itself.  On the cover of each ream, the detailed information provided says that the paper can also be used for black and white printing (it says “Try our premium papers for color printing”).  I have used it for printing and it does work well enough for black and white text, but not color.  I object to the labeling of this product as “printer paper” on Amazon.

I have been buying this particular brand of copier paper for a few years because it's usually very well priced for the quality and brightness. In the past, the individual reams would be packaged in paper, and when the delivery guy dropped the carton off at my front door, half or more of the reams inside the carton would tear apart. This would dry out the paper as it sat on the shelf waiting to be used.Now they are wrapping the paper reams in plastic. But that's no better. While the reams stay intact inside the carton, they are almost impossible to open without using utility knives or scissors. It's enough of an annoyance to have to refill the paper in the copier let alone having to do battle with the wrapper on the paper ream. Besides, with all the plastic finding its way into the ocean these days, I find it ironic that Hammermill would design a school of swimming fish for its wrapper. Why can't Hammermill show some environmental consciousness and go back to paper wrappers that are designed to open easily but strong enough not to tear in impact.

I am not sure what am gonna do now since I ordered a bulk! I did not know it will be that thin…! I cannot make a note on the back with a black pen. It is showing through. Lets see if I can talk to amazon about it. Especially if I am faxing docs over. The ink is showing very well though, very bright.

The packaging was not as impressive, paper was falling out of the rims

When selling paper for its quality, you would think the manufacturer would us paper of quality to wrap its product.  All reams split/damaged upon arrival.  The case box was not glued properly to protect and/or move its contents.

The paper is really thin. Office Depot brand is far better.

Looks OK, the paper fails to feed every 10-15 sheets!

The shipping box was re-taped and shows some corner damage. The box of paper had a torn corner and the paper wrapping of each ream of paper is torn. The paper itself appears to be okay where the wrapping is torn. I am assuming that the paper overall is ok.

expensive

If you’re like me & just need paper for the kids reports, homework, kids project etc. This is perfect for all those things. I would not recommend using it for Resume’s, but for everything else it’s fine. My son goes through so much paper because he always wants to draw & use his scissors ✂️. So it’s perfect. We try getting him art pads & notebooks but he wants & prefer to use the loose leaf papers instead. Kids right! 😀

I tried to find a way to contact International Paper to give them feed back, but on their 'contact us' page of the web site there was no way to contact them that I could find.  The outer wrap of the reams is plastic, and very difficult to open.  I used a razor knife to at least get into it a little, and every time I tried to tear it open a little bit of plastic came off--it ended up in about 8 pieces.  Finally, more razor knife assistance and struggling, I got the paper out.  It shouldn't be this difficult AND why not use something that biodegrades faster, like, uh, paper?

I found that my printer has a paper jam often more than any other brand I have used in the past And we think that may be because the paper is stick together. I dont know how to explain it but Steven hard to separate it with tuning finger to it. This past few weeks since I start using this paper I have to pull paper jam daily which is a waste. Although paper is actually very thick and quality. I just don't know how to stop it from paper jam.

Pricey. But, isn't everything. Lol

The paper box was torn in every direction, not one ream arrived without injury (some fatal), but, this was a great bargain for home use! =-)  If you're not persnickety about giving your postman a hernia and the pink HEAVY label doesn't scare you, then you'll love this paper.  It's all about arriving alive.  Paper was of great quality and the prime shipping was free.  Bright white, great thickness, and works well for home/work needs!  What a bargain for $ .0073/sheet!

I was disappointed in the quality of this paper.  Probably up to 2-3 percent of the individual pages have creases down the length of the page.  There are also small brown flecks on many of them.  I guess this is expected with just copy paper.  Just beware.  It is not suitable for printing nice documents.

We bought a box a few months ago so we just opened a new pack and about every third sheet is wrinkled and unusable.  I don’t see a way to contact the seller. I would like a replacement package or this one is a waste of money.

The bottom two reams came damaged, they were opened and paper damaged.

My 8-ream order should have been cut in half!This quality product is heavy.  I'm surprised it isn't divided in half before delivery.The quality is great.  I'll buy again in about two years!

Good medium-grade paper.  I use it for printing oil and gas title documents.

Shipped on time.

It works

easy to use for projects

Unfortunately, most of the packages of paper were broken open.  Sad to see

I bought this in conjunction with a printer during the pandemic because I needed to print out documents.It’s just paper so there isn’t much to it. HOWEVER, the paper quality is 100% not what you’re used to seeing out in the wild. What I mean by this is that it’s not what you would find or use for printing purposes like you would at schools, offices, and etc. The paper is sort of like a sheet of paper you’d find in a kids college ruled notebook but just blank and slightly shorter. Besides that it’s paper and works well, just you’ll notice the difference when held and people will find it odd when you hand it to them. It’s not a bad thing but it’s just differentFor all normal purposes it works fine and with the amount you get from this, you won’t have issue finding scrap paper or drawing paper anytime soon. It’s been like 3 years since I got this and I still have ALOT of paper.

I got what I paid for. It’s paper

DAMAGE TO BOX DAMAGE TO PRODUCT 1 REAM I AM NOT ABEL TO USE IN MY PRINTER

The outer wrapping paper cover was broken and torn.

They need to improve how they ship the paper but the paper itself is very nice and professional...The box had some damage when it arrived. They need to improve the quality of the box that the reels of paper are delivered in but the paper itself is very good and I would recommend it to anyone who needs this amount of paper or more. Two thumbs up for the paper and it's quality but my thumbs lack the same enthusiasm for the box it came in as it was partially damaged due to less than a high quality box to be delivered in.Good day & God Bless...Randall M. RueffK9RMR

Great paper for the price

Good product for the money

Paper is thinner than my usual paper. It is making hard to print on two sides. Price is fine.

Hammermill is a well known brand, one that I have been familiar with for many years. I was surprised that every single sleeve the paper was in tore open as I took the reams out to put them on our shelves. Not a big deal, just surprised for a company like Hammermill to put their product out like this. I usually get the big store brand paper & decided to simplify by ordering online. I will probably get it again, but hope they correct this issue.

Worked well on what I needed it for.

Nice paper... You can easily see through the page so don't use for 2-sided printing. They offer a thicker paper in an orange box for that.

great delivery driver....helped place heavy items on the table for me!  Nice job..

Good

I ordered this for our office and we haven't used it yet, but I was surprised it was wrapped in some kind of plastic paper rather than the usual paper that is easy to tear.  I don't like this for two reasons - It makes it more difficult to open up and would seem to potentially affect the paper inside in hot conditions, and it is bad for the environment.  Paper disentigrates, plastic does not.  The quality seems to be the same as what I've previously ordered, but we shall see.

Not too long ago I remember purchasing a box of copy paper with ten (10) reams. Now thanks to the Pandemic, supply chain issues and more, we are paying more for smaller boxes with just eight reams. At least the paper quality is the same and I highly recommend.

I'm finding this paper to feel slightly thicker than normal "Costco" print paper and it jammed twice while I was reproducing a large print job.  I suspect it's the paper because when it jammed I received a message on my printer's screen blaming the paper for not being what HP recommends.  No damage to the printer and the paper seems to work great for normal home use.

I use this paper probably 80% of the time for most of my printing needs. The weight and brightness works well for printing email, notes, receipts', grocery lists, reminders, or just about anything you can think of.Of course I do need something a little more substantial for brochures, pictures, etc. But, for general use, I use this light weight paper.

The only paper we use at our office for printing

Ordered 4 reams of paper, and not a single one arrived without torn packaging or loose papers.  The 3 that were packaged together sustained a lot of damage, but even the one that was boxes as a single had torn through the ream packaging in a couple places.  Should be able to use most of the paper, but far from ideal.  Paper seems as advertised, correct, a bit more opacity would be nice, but it was a fair price for the quality.

It might just be the couple cases we bought but about every 20-25 pages we will get a paper that is creased a little, just enough to aggravate you as it seems to happen only when im printing something I need to come out clean.  Doesnt affect the printer in any way though as far as a paper jam or anything.  Ive bought about 5 cases so far and 2 have done this in every ream.  Ill still keep buying for the price and quality though, hopefully those 2 cases were just a fluke.

It's nice paper.The issue is that all 8 reams of paper had their individual outer wrapping ripped open pretty bad.  Probably due to shipping and poor packaging...we're assuming all the sheets in the 8 reams are there but honestly who knows.  Next time we'll probably wait for a Staples sale.

Amazon is unable to follow delivery instruction to delivery packages heavy & sized like this. (My recent order was left outside the building in rain) Your product is great but delivery through Amazon doesn't work. Other vendors do bring this product inside office.

Looks good, copies good, the printer likes it - no problems.

The paper comes double-boxed and makes it difficult to disperse. I have to cut open and break apart the outer Amazon carton box before getting to the boxed paper which is too heavy to lift out of the outer box. It would be simpler to send the paper with an Amazon label instead of double boxing. It is also a waste and non-economy effective.

I've used Hammermill paper for years and, every time I switch to another brand or a "discount" paper, I save a little but find the sheet quality inconsistent. I'd love it to be cost-competitive but consider it a reliable printer/copier paper.

Love this paper. Good quality for the price. Only disappointment was that it was shipped in a box with enough room to shift around back and forth. This caused the end of paper packing on ream to be torn and several sheets (about20!) to be unusable in printer. Not the product’s fault however!

I have no problem with this product. It was always delivered without any problem but the last time it was sent via USPS  and I had to go to pick it up, they couldn’t deliver it because it was too big and heavy. It was a big issue, I got hurt on my back because I carried it. I thought I paid for a home delivery???

I go thru a lot of printing paper on my laser b & w printer.  Tried this brand first ime. It is okay - but a little less white than what I was used to and also a bit coarser.  Seems to work okay though, so can't complain.  Price was good.

Feels a little thin for 20 lb paper but has worked fine for the everyday printing we do.

This paper is Incredible! It is white, pure and super foldable. This isn't your run of the mill paper. It is extremely easy to read when used for printing and slides into an envelope like a $20 bill. Just awesome, not to mention the  fitness benefits of lugging the 50lb. carton into the house. I will definitely buy this product again.

works

There are not so many print paper under $5 per 500 realm nowadays.  I haven't used it just by looking and feeling.  Printing quality not much concern only hope not get paper jam.

When I opened the case. Many of the reams had the outside paper cover ripped.  I would say 80 percent. The box of reams were inside a larger carton. Not certain the reason for the damage.

I personally think it's worth the money, you get so much quantity for the money you spend. However, it's not the best quality for printing. A few have a white line across them. It's not going to be glossy or thick. But if you want it for mainly unprofessional purposes or aren't too picky, then these are great.

This is good quality paper - thank you

I like the paper and it is good quality. I gave the rating 4 stars because the package was damaged and some of the paper was as well when delivered.

Quality paper but the price DOUBLED in the past month.

This is a good every day with 92 brightness. If you need a very white paper pay the extra for HP 96 brightness.

Good value

Package damaged. Will lose a ream of paper. Hopefully can get it taken care of. Other than that never had any issues.

We use this paper at work for printing, with both ink jet and laser printers. It is a decent paper and does not jam. It is a little thin, and wouldn't use it on a super professional report, but it works well for the everyday printing. It is about half the price of buying individual reams at an office supply store. For some reason, the brick and mortar stores really up-charge for the 3-hole paper.

I use a HP Laser Printer at home. This is the first time using the hammermill paper and I found that many times multiple Pages have gone through the printer at one time. Never had this happen before with other paper I purchase through Amazon. Quality is good but not happy with it pulling extra sheets through the printer. Most likely would go back to the original paper I was using before

We received 5 boxes of paper and the paper looks great. However, the delivery was surprisingly bad. We are located in an office building complex. Our office door is in a busy outdoor hallway with many people passing by hourly. We opened our door in the afternoon to greet a new client, and there were the boxes! Alone. With no one nearby. Sitting there. Outside. Available for anyone to take. Terrible delivery.

Copying and printouts

We use these in our office as our usual go to for our printer. A great price for the number of sheets and never had a problem with the quality of paper.

Purchased based on price. They have the quality that we expected. Buy with confidence.

Best Price for Paper Delivered to My Door!

Quality product for the price.

Works well

Received in good shape, I have used the brand for sometime.

It's Printer Paper and does well!!

Very papery paper. 5 stars!

best way to get a good price on printer paper.

Hammermill's reputation for excellent paper is proved by this product. It prints well and has an excellent feel. For the money, great value.

It has NEVER jammed my HP Office Jet  Pro 9025 --  so from personal experience, the failure rate is less than 1/10,000, or less than .001%

This size is great for creating a student checklist for the classroom.

Love the look of my print jobs on this paper. Very professional, and runs through my digital press great!

The paper is great. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you.

Arrived on time

Perfect weight

nice

Works great with my HP OfficeJet Pro inkjet printer.  Basic printing paper - as expected.

The quality of this paper is good. It is pretty thick; I don't have to worry about it ripping very easily. We run a business and am constantly copying papers for contracts, invoicing and numerous other things. It never gets jammed up in my copier causing me to have to stop and remove the crumpled-up paper, like I do with other thin paper I have gotten before. Price is really reasonable. I would buy again.

I have been using the paper for my Brother printer for the whole month and have printed several hundreds pages at a time without any jam or stoppage. The print shows up well on the paper. Highly recommended for household printer with heavy usage. The price was reasonable, about 15 to 20% lower than that of brand name paper.

We use this paper all the time in our office. Great thickness and we do not have paper jam issues.

Great value for paper for the office printer.

No issues, good quality

Good paperwork well no jams

everything about this purchase was perfect

I like this copy paper for general use.  My office is not paperless So we use a lot of paper. This paper is good quality for most any normal use.Great value! I will be ordering again soon!Quick shipping!!

Appreciate the quick delivery

good product

Good product.

Product was great but the delivery was not. I tried to tell UPS but this has not been for some reason. The box was crushed some and the paper package was damaged. All I am using these for are cover sheets for sublimation work. If I needed them for a print job I would definitely have to return them.

Paper I cannot live without!!!

Good quality paper. Doesn’t jam. I couldn’t find a better page per dollar anywhere else!

This product is absolutely fantastic! It exceeded my expectations in every way. From its superb quality to its outstanding performance, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Truly awesome

I have printed thousands of pages on this paper over the past 5 years, and I will never buy another brand. This paper is exceptional for preventing printer jams and consistently delivering high-quality prints. The manufacturer always provides a great product, and I have never encountered any issues.

I have used this paper for long time, I think it is the best for the price,  and will continue to use.  Also, the paper is of a high and prints well, I have had know problem using in any printer I have had.  The end.

Just a great product for a great price; and Amazon's handling of the transaction and speedy delivery are attributes that other online sellers could/should emulate.

While I don’t do anything elaborate, this paper is  fine for work and for home printing.  No issues what so ever.  It was the best value for the amount purchased

Review: Hammermill Printer Paper is a printing revelation – the 20 lb, 8.5 x 11 size, 8 ream (4,000 sheets) pack is an absolute game-changer. With a brightness level of 92 and being proudly made in the USA, it consistently delivers sharp and vibrant prints. The reliable quality ensures jam-free printing, making it a go-to choice for high-volume tasks. From crisp text to vivid images, Hammermill proves why it's a trusted name in the world of printing papers, providing durability and performance that never disappoints.

I don't have any complaints. It is standard paper.

Good

We have bought from Amazon Basics many times before.  We were disappointed that the paper arrived damaged on both sides of the ream.  I only took a picture of a few of the reams, but they were all damaged.  This makes our paper less protected from elements and could cause jamming of our copier.

She was unhappy with me for ordering a whole case.Her actual words are WTF and that the rems weighed too much

The quality of the boxes and ream covers are very poor . When I removed the plastic wrap they literally fell apart. The paper was not damaged.

paper too thin to use

My box of paper was hanging together barely ! And not only that my paper (EVERY SINGLE ONE) was ripped apart!

The box had a bad tear that had completely destroyed a ream of paper. The Ream is completely useless and now a loss.

I ordered two reams of paper and both arrived wide open.  I have no idea if paper was lost along the way but an open ream of paper is not easy to store cleanly.  Yes, I could have returned it but not worth my time.  You would think and actual Amazon product would arrive in one piece.

This paper is not good for printing.  Ink constantly smears and corners always curl up going through printer.  Constant paper jams and poor print quality.  Not worth the $ you save.  Buy higher quality paper.  It's so bad I'm going to recycle what's left out of the pack :(

Box arrived broken and taped up - see pictures. Paper looked to be ok (four packages were popped open) - box was in bad shape.

Jams in hp printers, not worth the problems. Not recommended

Ordered two reams.  Says it is 20lb, but paper is thinner than the 20lb paper I already have at home.  Both reams arrived with the packaging falling right off.

if you want the printer to jam all the time order this cheap paper. this paper will damage the printer since it has been jamming the printers. pay little more get better quality paper.

I did a search for heavy paper and all I got was a regular cheap ream of white paper. It's worth $3.50

The box was bad- the paper around the paper was ripped & tattered. I would  not buy again. .

Have tried on 2 different printers - thought it was my paper feeder and bought new printer - that one will not feed paper either....the paper is too thin - choose something better.

*eye roll* not going to count but not sure it’s a full ream anymore.

Arrived very torn up unrelated to shipping.

The box only included 9 reams of paper instead of 10.  Not worth returning because of the cost.  DO NOT ORDER THIS!

Package was not full of paper but 100 or so sheets of paper and random recycled materials -returned

all 3 packages were open in the box and so when i opened the box the paper went everywhere

1500 sheets for $28.I can get 10,000 sheets of same quality for $30.

Not good price

The packaging was all torn, most of the paper was all wrinkled that had to be thrown out.

Paper came opened - not super helpful.

Very thin, I mean very thin.  I wouldn't buy again.

Not good

I am a production MFP copier technician (15 yrs exp) and I just wanted to forewarn everyone about Amazon Basic Paper. I'm sure the paper is fine for use in a small desktop printer, but if you have a bigger laser printer, this paper is horrible and problematic. I have had to go out to many customers sites just because of Amazon Basic paper, no machine issues whatsoever. The common issues I have seen are light copies due to paper taking on excess humidity and curling of paper (looks like a scroll when it exits the machine).If you print a lot and need/want good copy quality please buy a Boise or Hammermill. Something of more quality.Thanks

Amazon turned into a joke. Why are people still buying here? The prices are like 4-5 times higher than your local brick and mortar.

This paper is very glossy and won't work in a commercial copier.  It jammed the machine several times and wouldn't accept the toner. We literally can't use it for anything.

This paper is blue not white! I thought it was a mistake when I got it so I when through the return process and asked for it to be reshipped (Amazon did let me keep the original order).  Received the replacement today and it is also blue.  It does not indicate on the packaging that is is blue paper (it says 92 bright which should be white paper) so it appears to be a packaging problem from the manufacturer.  Otherwise quality of paper is good.

do not order unless waist sizes are given.

paper is super thin and doesn't print properly!

It said it was white paper when I ordered, but i received blue paper. I needed it for work and I didn't have time to return and wait for a new one so just ended up using it. But I don't recommend, unless you need blue paper!

This was deliberately shipped this way. Not happy. Also not sure why but I was under the impression I was getting a 3 pack.

I honestly didn't realize it was one package. Good paper but WAY overpriced. Amazed it was also a sale price. Note to self...check quantities carefully.

Waste of money. I was dumb, didn't think I'd need to check reviews on PAPER. I was shipped 500 blue sheets. Absolutely irrevocably useless.

It's blue. It has ' bright white' used to describe it in 4 different places in the description n summary. Cannot see the word blue even mentioned anywhere.Why would I order blue printer paper?

I had no idea this paper would be blue and now I'm stuck with an entire ream of blue paper... Guess I missed that part in the description :(

This paper is blue. The description clearly says bright white. Now I have to go through the whole return process and still have no paper for my printer.

Don't buy this if you want white paper!  It is actually BLUE and it is written nowhere on the packaging or this site!

Paper is BLUE guys!!Don’t buy if you are looking for something white!

The description and the packaging on the paper says the paper is bright - but it is BLUE!

It’s BLUE paper. I ordered white paper as the written description says. Good quality if you don’t mind the colour.

PAPER IS BLUE. Product is described as white. But it is blue. And it is poor quality.But amazon did refund me.

This paper is blue! I had no idea before buying. Now my kids use for craft paper

This paper is BLUE! I can't find anywhere on the package or in the description that made this obvious.

Paper is so thin. Don’t try and double sided print. You can see right through it.Color are washed and ink soaks far to much. Mould not buy again

Description says paper is white, they sent blue paper.

Box was split on all sides and individual paper packages inside were torn on the ends.  Lid was split.Box had been taped all around.

The box that the 3 reams of paper are in is so tight, that when pulling out it ripped each one. I think it also compressed the paper too much so you’ll see that it bent the corner of one ream. I didn’t want to return the item for it to never be used so just kept it. But beware this product is trying to be too efficient with space/packaging.

Even though it came in a box, the paper around the sheets was ripped open at both ends making it look like it was used or some sheets removed.  Wont order Amazon Basic's again.

The paper is great. The package has such a small amount of glue, it was open and all over the inside of the box when I opened it. Didn’t care enough to take a photo. It’s much worse than 52 pickup for sure

bought a ream of  AmazonBasics copy paper with several other items. the paper had broken through its outer cover and ended up spread over other items. not happy with flimsy cover on paper!

Thin paper but does the job and good price for a 3 pk case

High price

This paper is good if you want to print on one side only. It’s very thin. However very cheap so you get what you paid for. Also package came opened. Will definitely not but again as I like to print double sided.

Ink prints fine on this paper but the paper itself is extremely thin. I like to highlight my notes and the highlighter ink excessively bleeds through the paper more so than with other brands.

This paper is blue. Not white like the description states. Very disappointed. Who knew you’d have to read the reviews on paper.

Good paper.  Runs thru printer and scanner with out jamming.  The shipping was a pain.  I ordered 2 boxes this size to be able to carry safely.  They boxed them together so I had the weight to carry but lost the savings of buying a larger box🤦🏻‍♀️

I bought it for the price, and it's acceptable for printing documents for internal office use. But definitely, it is not the quality you would want to give copies to clients.If you are, you'll want to comb through the prints, as several pages will have creases.

all the reams were open, this is not the first time this has happened, it is recurring in this product.

It's basic copy paper. What more is there to say?

I believe that this paper is ok.

This paper is “paper” thin on all accounts. This is not a good paper choice if you do double sided printing. Don’t bother trying to highlight anything on this paper either I’d you printed on both sides. The paper is thin and the quality is mediocre at best.

See the back of the paper after printing by HP printer. A paper is very thin. Price isnt impressive either. I would expect ~$5 for a ream since this is amazon basic brand.

Not what I would recommend. There are other companies with better prices. the recycled paper meant that the paper weight is low making the paper thinner and less quality.

The product was usable, but when it arrived in the box, a sizable number of papers were folded on the edges and not in their wrapping paper

It’s printer paper.

Even after fanning paper it jams in printer, was not cut with sharp enough slicer during manufacturing, rough edges

THERE ARE BETTER VALUES

Too small for the price

It is just paper. Quality is OK.

The wrap around the ream was undone and my 500 sheets were scattered all over my shipping box. Some with bent edges, not the kind of paper that would work in your printer.  Need to seal the wrap better!

Good price but the paper is thin. When we point, you can see some of the ink bleed through.

This is fine for something like printing off your kids coloring pages but I've purchased better paper at the $8.99 price that Amazon is selling this for. I would not use this on a regular basis, nor would I purchase this paper. It is on the thinner side, cheaper quality.

This paper is a bit thinner than regular printer paper like what you'd find in an office. If you print double sided you can see a bit of the ink on the other of the page. I would suggest printing in draft to avoid this issue.

Like others said, it's blue paper. This is not mentioned anywhere in product description. Totally misleading. But I decided to keep it eventually, coz I found it's actually easy for eyes to read on such light blue paper. Can use it to print personal/informal docs.

The paper quality is good but the packaging was defective. The case was torn and few papers were already out of the pouch.

The paper quality is ok If you dont care about the color....

worth buying.  I found walmart offering cheaper price than amazon

It was blue. Packaging was ripped on both ends. We kept it anyway.

It ‘s paper... not too exciting! As described.

used for personal applications

Great paper. Nice and white.

I compare prices to a lot of stores… this is the best price around. The paper works great in a big copy machine. Doesn’t jam.

Ease to use. Paper quality

Could have gone to the local office supply store for basically the same price but would have had to lug it home. This came to the front door!

It seems to be fine for mu use.

I’m a sucker for off brand items and a good deal. These are just like any name brand you would spend more money on. The size fits perfectly in my printer and has yet to jam. Comes in a decently sized heavy box so be prepared to move it.

Great product at a good price, shipped timely

I’ve been buying this paper for my printer for several years.  No complaints.

Love this paper, less jams in the printer

I really like this paper. I like the texture of it and it’s very smooth. I don’t however care for how thin it is. I would like it to be a little thicker.

I feel bad for downing a star, but one of the pages had a hole in it about the size of... I don't know, Headphone jack? Still, a hole. Not even a top sheet, it was a few in.

This paper was fine but it wasn’t a great price, especiallyFor a store brand. I could have gotten two twice the paper ofTheSame quality  for the price of this one at office max. It wasConvenient though.

I ordered this wondering how you could go wrong with paper but this paper is annoyingly thin. It sounds like a strange complaint for cheap printer paper, but it is so exceptionally thin that it is worth docking a star.

The first time I ordered this, it got lost.  The second time I ordered it, it showed up!  So there's that.

will order again

nuf said

great weighted paper, always clean and in perfect condition. love that it partially sources recycled items as well.

Reall goof

Good printing paper

As good as the high price paper.

Good quality unlike most other Amazon products I’ve purchased.

runs great in my printer

Nice paper but package and paper arrived open.

All was good.

Just what I needed...

Good paper, nice weight!

Most of us, unless we are printing out resumes, or special letters, really buy the cheapest printer paper.  Occasionally that bites us with poor finishes and jams.  Mostly I have asked store staff, what is the best buy, just expensive enough for reasonable quality but cheap enough to be economical. Mind you, if I had important documents, I might go out and buy a ream unique to that usage.Well here is the last economical ream I bought: Recommended to me by Office Depot staff (they are 2 miles away). Most likely because this had 125 pages free  and it was comparable to the one I had in hand both price and quality, minus the extra sheets.Office Depot 24946178**** SKU 35854 98965**** Multipurpose paper**** Bright white**** Preferred**** 625 sheets (125 free sheets) special sale**** 20 pound**** 96 Brightness**** 8.5 x 11”**** Made in USA**** 99.99% no jam**** ColorLok Technology**** Faster drying time**** Bolder Blacks**** Vivid ColorsLooking at their website today,the cost for this ream is: $8.29 (for only 500 sheets, no current special).10 reams are $57.99. I’m assuming the website and store costs are the same.However they do have a 30% recycled paper version as well, but it carries an FSC certificationBlurb from the website:Meets the global standards of the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council).  Forest Stewardship Council US-0081. FSC Certification ensures responsible use of forest resources and provides assurance that the fiber in this paper comes from forests that are well-managed to protect biodiversity and the livelihoods of the people that depend on those forests.**** Green Seal®-certified to ensure lower impact on the environment and human health.This paper too is 92 Brightness and is also $8.29 a ream.This reviewed paper is:Amazon basicsSKU 41710 1902330% Recycled Multipurpose Copy PaperNo name equivalent to Bright WhiteNo name equivalent to Preferred500 sheets20 pound92 Brightness8.5 x 11”Made in USA30% PCWI don’t see any mention of FSC certified.Cost for this ream is: $8.49: 10 reams are $49.99Since I have Prime there is no real shipping cost.Clearly the Amazon one has a significant discount if you use a lot of paper and the brightness difference is not an issue.  These are not apples to apples.Above, I looked up a 30% recycled material paper on Office Depot and it was essentially the same cost as the regular paper, but with also the reduced brightness.On first look.  Office Depot non-30% recycled paper is clearly whiter.  Would have noticed even if I did not see the difference in Brightness.  Assuming this may be due to the recycled material.PrintingI see no appreciable difference in printing, either in adherence, or quality.  As I said, there is a subtle difference in Brightness.  If that does not bother you and you buy 10 reams at a time, thisAmazon basics 30% Recycled Multipurpose Copy Paper is a better buy at $8 cheaper for 10 reams.  Basically 1 free ream. For me who buys a ream at a time, less of a deal, they appear equal.UPDATE: Posting a photo to show the difference in Brightness between the Amazon paper at 92 and OfficeMax at 96. It's subtle but visible.

This paper is fine to use for general purpose copies or things like tickets and coupons.  I definitely would not use it for any important reports or anything that needs to look good.  I do like that the paper is made with 30% recycled material, and I can't really tell that it's recycled.  It looks pretty much the same as my Stapes brand multi purpose paper.  The Staples paper feels a bit stiffer in hand making it feel more high quality than the AmazonBasics paper though.We generally don't print anything important on our home printer, so this stuff is fine for us.  The price for a ream seems comparable to what you would find at Staples, so I'd be willing to pick up another pack if I see the AmazonBasics stuff go on sale.

You know when you're reviewing copy paper that your life has hit a new low. Be that as it may, I generally like Amazon's AmazonBasics line, which makes decisions on boring everyday items a little easier, since odds are I'm already ordering from Amazon anyway. This paper is a nice bright white, brighter than some cheap copy papers I've used, and decently thick. Perfectly good choice for paper.

This is perfectly acceptable copy paper -- but nothing special.  I have been paying a little extra for Hammerhill premium paper and find that the extra weight and crispness is worth the addition penny or so a page the paper costs.  Although this paper is acceptable, I do think there are better papers available at a similar or better price.

Not beautiful paper but serviceable. I won't print important documents on this, but it's just fine for everyday notes and creating package labels. Arrived fast. Price appears to be pretty good compared to similar papers.

Most of the time, we just buy the cheapest printer paper we can find and that works well for our needs. This paper is similar to what we normally use. It's a great choice if you have simple, basic needs for printing. If you need it for something fancier, you'll want to go another route.We've been pleased with this paper.

Good set of copy paper. One ream and fits our Brother laser printer. Doesn't bleed and sharp edges in the type.

This paper makes a good enough copy and works ok in my inkjet printer.  I like that it is more environmentally conscious than some.  I normally use HP paper of the same weight and side to side, it seems a bit more opaque, and the print does seem brighter.  Normally the AmazonBasics paper is less, but I usually buy paper by the case and that's an easy way to get the lowest prices.I would buy this again though if the price was lower than my preferred brands.  There's not enough difference to worry about.  Mainly I just print coupons and tax forms.  It's certainly good enough for those.  It's always good to have viable options so I can pick the best price.

SO NOT SURE ... WHEN OPENED AND USED FIRST PACKAGE HAPPENED TO PUT IN FRESH INK... THERE WAS A BAD FISHY SMELL IN DEN WHEN PRINTING.  I THOUGHT INK AND CONTACTED COMPANY AND ALTHOUGH SOME REVIEWS ON LINE SAYING SOME INK SMELLS FISHY, THERE ARE ALSO REVIEWS SAYING PAPER CAN EMIT A BAD FISH SMELL ESPECIALLY IF RECYCLED PAPER.  THEN SMELL WENT AWAY.  THAT WAS LAST MONTH. OPENED FRESH PACKAGE OF PAPER FEW DAYS AGO , INK ABOUT WEEK AGO AND TODAY SAME SMEL ALTHOUGH WAS NOT USING PRINTER BUT WAS TURNED ON. . SO I AM NOT SAYING ITS THE PAPER AND I AM NOT SAYNG IT ISNT.  I JUST READ ABOUT THE PROBLEMS PAAPER MANUFACTURERS HAVE WITH PAPER AND CARDBOARD WHEN HEATED AND NOT SURE IF MY PRINTER HAS SOME TYPE OF HEAT BAR INSIDE.  ANYWAY,  ALTHOUGH I WAITED A LONG TIME FOR DELIVERY OF HTIS  PAPER DURING COVID AND NEVER BOUGHT THIS BRAND BEFORE, I WILL PUT REMAINDER AWAY AND BUY THE BRAND I USUALLY BUY AND SEE IF GET ODOUR AGAIN;  IF I DO THEN IT MUST BE THE INK... NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THIRTY YEARS OF USING HOME PRINTER.  OTHERWISE QUALITY AND PRICE GO0D AND I WILL TRY AND RE-REVIEW IF I FIND OUT ITS THE INK...BUT BEEN USING SAME BRAND FOR DOZEN YEARS. SORRY

Its paper, seems ok. Prob not the best deal but I was feeling lazy, so I was willing to pay a few cents more for not having to go to a shop.Arrived with the pacakge broken open, but all the paper was still fine and usable. Probably due to too much air space in the box, amazon tends to have a problem with overly large boxes, and this  causes too much rattling around even with bubble stuff in there.

Paper it’s self is good quality

Good paper, People need to know that it’s only three reams of paper and not more because you’re only getting three bricks of 500 sheets of paper so make sure you understand how much that costs and it’s all good.

All is good for the paper, a little thin though compared to store bought paper and more money, however I didnt have to go to get it 🙂. Only issue was that the wrapper was all opened up and a bit ripped so no way of knowing if it was all there.

That It does not smug

Paper works good for returns and copying docs

Decent quality for the price.

Good thickness, smooth texture, does not dampen ink color

the printer paper is good

This paper meets all of my expectations for laser and jet printing office needs. Paper quality is comparable to brand other brand name printer paper manufacturers. Cost is comparable and reasonable. Our company has switched to this brand for all of our offices. Highly recommend for price, quality, and shipping speed.

great paper and price prints great in both my HP and cannon printers did not have to drive to town so saved even more money Thanks Amazon Basic saved some trees and us some money

Works as advertised.

This paper is good for standard photocopying or printing for the record. If my print project was important such as a document for a client, I would want to use higher quality paper.

Perfect.

Quick arrival and this paper gets the job done for my printer.

this is a good buy! paper quality is good!!

Nice copier paper. I notice that the cartons are wrapped in plastic.

IT IS GOOD QUALITY PAPER

The Price was half of what Walmart wanted. I guess free Prime Shipping is worth the Wait

When our only local office supply closed last year, I had to look elsewhere to order my office supplies.  I've been using recycled paper for several years from various suppliers, so when I saw that Amazon Basics offered a recycled option I was eager to try it.  I was a little concerned about some of the negative reviews, mainly the ones saying that it didn't feed properly.  I haven't had ANY problems; it feeds perfectly for single sided and double sided printing.  I use an Epson inkjet printer in my home office.  The print quality is great, and the paper feels like a better quality than the last brand I used.  I'm very pleased with this paper, and will definitely reorder when I need more!

I just needed some basic printer paper for the office. This printer paper is so basic it’s wearing Ugg boots, leggings and ordering pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks. Perfect.

It functioned as it was supposed to

Works great for my laser printer , no complaints.

High Quality Product

I wish I had discovered this brand earlier. Great value for money and a solid product for my inkjet printer.

It has been years since I have had to purchase printer paper for home/office use.  I was surprised at how expensive the paper was but with everything else in this world, the prices have gone up.  I have opened the first ream with no issues.  I will reorder again if necessary.

This paper is god damn life changing!I printed mountains of pictures of me eating tacos. Also, during lockdown, I ate the taco 🌮 pictures. A little bland but packed with fiber. Would recommend.

I liked the quickness of the delivery. Actually I love it! I like the amount I ordered because the box fits right under my printer. It's small and compact making it easier to make it fit anywhere. My son's in college  and he has his own printer and uses it more than I use my printer.  The paper is great, doesn't get stuck. Not paper jams on my HP printer or my son's Canon.

I do volunteer work at home price  and quality of paper very good

It’s copy paper, it’s fine in my laser printer and price is usually better than the others.

When i opened the package, i was pleasantly surprised. The paper was white, flat, and smooth.You have those moments in life when you know something is missing. When the copy paper arrived, i knew my life was now complete. I am whole.

This paper is excellent in every way. Every AmazonBasics item I've bought has been well-priced and superior in quality - and the printer paper is no exception. When Amazon's name is on an item, I believe it receives more thorough inspection.

Good paper

I usually stock up at Staples, but was on call and could't get out, so I placed an order. The paper came quickly and it prints just as well as the Hammermill I usually get.

printer paper.

Vivid bright white paper, perfect for letters and even serves well for full-color flyer prints. Thickness is not so thick that it feels of cardstock but thick enough that printing on both sides doesn't bleed through. Great price for quality paper!

Works well.  Not too stiff or flimsy.

Looks like paper. Acts like paper. Works like paper. Tears like paper. It's paper!

I Got it yesterday for my new printer . It worth the money sincerely.

Paper actually somehow stayed clean and didn’t become dusty after being left out in the open. Very nice and reliable product, but that’s what you can expect from amazon right.

Do I want to schlep to Office Depot to buy paper? Nope. Amazon's is just as good, or better, and with a 2 day Prime delivery, I can't argue. Good value.

It’s paper!

It's a box of printer paper. It functions as expected for a box of printer paper. The paper it contains is fully compatible with most printers and writing instruments.

I just needed more copy paper for routine use. Combined with other purchase got free shipping. Saved me money and a trip to the store.

It’s paper. Feels and looks like paper. Slightly thicker than normal paper maybe? Bright white.

Good quality paper

Good quality.  Fast shipping.

Very please.  Cost is great.

This is some good paper

Do not buy. They are cheap and as such I bought them as a single use product. While I’m not a fan of single use anything I don’t do very much painting ever, so I bought the cheapest thing with the fastest delivery. They were intended to make very small touch ups to an enamel paint job I did on a few PC components both plastic and metal. I dipped themWith just a tiny drop of paint to just dot on a few 1 square millimeter gaps in the spray paint job where my masking tape was over cut by just a hair. I was applying a tiny little drop of paints in areas only marginally bigger than a pin head. The entire brush didn’t see paint, just a little dot on the tip. Some how transferring a trivial amount of paint smaller than a single drop of water resulted in bristles on my paint job. Given I was touching up an enamel paint job and enamel can take a week or more to fill cure those bristles got into the original base cost. Trying to get the bristles out pulled up the not fully cured base coat. This caused me to have to remove the paint from my entire piece, re-sand it, and start all over again. This is a cheap product and as such I asked very little of it and it cost me several hours of restarting a project because it failed mechanically in the most basic fundamental requirement of a paint brush lol. Do not buy.

These brushes are not the same color as advertised, at all, that’s the first thing, the brushes are more for children than for really good painting, if you want to be precise these are not it, after you clean them there is always one or two bristles that get pulled and are just sticking out and make it very hard to do anything precisely great, you will not notice until you have two lines instead of one on your painting, I bought them because it had 5 stars I don’t know why they would, maybe for kids, if you are looking for very good brushes these are not for you unless I got bad ones, I would want my money back but I know I won’t, so this was just a waste of my money, this product doesn’t deserve 5 stars more like 1 or 2.  Don’t believe the hype.

Messy

You get what you pay for. The brush heads come off, the bristles fray and are very long and flimsy, not good for painting tiny details. Did arrive on time though.

Bought these brushes for work as part of my job is painting and as soon as I used one and washed it off, it broke off in my  hands.Tried to super glue/gorilla glue them back together but that didn't work at all.Do not buy these unless you like wasting your money. I know they are $8 but they should still be better made.

I bought these to use for acrylic painting on canvas.  But the brushes DO NOT HOLD PAINT because the "hairs" are too plasticky and soft.  They will not hold a point either.  The ratings show almost 40,000 people loved them!  They must have gotten a different product than I did.  I can't even imagine anything they would be good for.  I guess they are fine for children to use for a child's painting project.

This would be a nice set for a child graduating from finger painting to tempera with a brush for the first time.Otherwise as an adult I found that they were very stiff and left ridges when using acrylics.  Now I just use them as disposable brushes for enamel paint which is thick enough when thinned  for the ridges to settle to settle on their. Use them once and throw them away.I won't be reordering and wouldn't recommend they to anyone.

I guess these will work better for brushing on make up, because they are useless for painting, the strands are not secured well and started to fall out when i cleaned the brush after my first use, the strands look nice and uniform, they seem to have some kind of hair spray on them to hold them together,  but once you start painting with them, they stray and you can't get a sharp line, I'll just end up using these to clean my paint guns...

I was skeptical because they are so inexpensive, but Amazon rated them as their number one choice.  Amazon clearly has never used these brushes.  The first time I used them, the bristles separated and started falling out making it impossible to stay within the lines of my paint by numbers pictures.  They come in array of sizes and are easy to clean, but they don’t hold up well, a major problem and a huge disappointment.  I have no choice but to look for something else.

A lot of the brush tips broke off.  It was a bit disappointing because I was trying to have these for my kids and I to do something we all enjoy doing and that wasn’t happening 🤦🏼‍♀️

I just recieved these this morning and upon opening them and feeling the bristles the bristles began to fall out without much force at all. If you want random hair bristles in your painting then these are great for you but if youre like me and dont, id stay clear of these. Bristles are falling out on almost every brush but especially the biggest one in the set as pictured. And thats before using them once to paint i cant imagine how much would come out while painting.

Not sure what world this is considered pink but it is not. More peach.

I ordered these just as cheap brushes to use in my normal crafting. One of the packs was already open and half the brushes in it were rock hard. I tried to rehabilitate the cheap brushes in some brush soap couldn't make a dent. I know these aren't high quality but I would expect to be able to use them.

These brushes are very cheaply made.  When you rinse them and try to dry them, they break.  Good thing I have 20 of them to work with.  You get what you pay for.  They are good for one time use.

Brushes don't stay in

I was excited to have some good sets of paintbrushes, but after 1 painting half of the first set broke at the end of the metal part. I wasn’t pushing down on the brushes or anything, just painting normally. I’ve never had brushes so flimsy, so that’s unfortunate.

The color was the wrong color according to website.TheBristles of the brushes come off easily. The dollar tree paint brushes are better than these. They only last one wash and one painting before they are ruined I highly suggest you not by !!!!!

These are of very low quality and are terrible for model use. Not for plastic or any models.

The advertized photo shows the handles as a cute pastel pink. The actual color received was an ugly yellow-ish pastel peach.The ones with blue handles arrived exactly as depicted in photo.

The brushes do not work well for painting in acrylic. They don't hold a line well. I would not recommend these for fine art work or detail craft work.  Otherwise they are fine.

On the first use of a couple different brushes, the bristles were falling out while I used them and by the finger fulls when I was cleaning them

After using most of the brushes in this set twice, the brush separated from the handles after cleaning. Poorly made and I'm sorry that I purchased them.

Don't waste your money. I used one to write words. Excellent job. When I rinse it, the head fell of!! These are garbage. Dissapointed

These brushes would be perfect for paint by number. Largest brush is size of my tiny pinky finger. Very small brushes.

I've used these one times and the glue for the handles came undone and bristles feel out of every brush I used

My daughter was so excited for her new brushes. She was pretty disappointed when the brush end fell off right away one one of the brushes.

Thought they would work fine for what I needed.  And they would have if they didn’t come at n me!

Anytime I tried to paint with these, bristles fell out onto my painting. Very upsetting :( was hoping for some nice paint brushes on sale for Black Friday but instead I got cheap broken brushes...

Please save your money.  These brush's were only used once. After they were cleaned and dryed. The paint cracked on the handle from the brush to the top.

Relatively cheap but I knew what I was buying so I was not surprised and I’m not complaining.

Whole painting with these brushes I noticed small hairs in my painting. Very disappointing!

Okay well firstly..they shed, more importantly they break..this is a picture of one I didn’t even use and it snapped.

Every brush I used broke the first time using it. I would never buy this product again! Money down the drain.

The top part fell apart from the stick...poor quality

Nearly all of them broke or were already breaking within the first use or a couple were already cracking at the base when they arrived. I was very dissatisfied

1st brush separated on first stroke. Do yourself a favor and invest in a better set of brushes.

My kids used these and wishing 5 minutes the heads of 5 different brushes snapped off

Brushes came in poor condition, quickly degraded into worse and worse quality. Lost bristles faster than my sanity attempting to do any detail work with this brushes. Find other cheap brushes to use.

I wanted some brushes for fine lines. Theaw brushes are awful. Do not but these. They are too still and paint doesn't flow well to the end. Just awful. Really.

They just keep breaking. Cheaply made. So so bad.

The brush kept falling apart

This is so cheap, I barely touched it and on the first use it snapped off.

These paint brushes are garbage. The little hairs come out of the tips, I’ve already had to throw half of them away.

Very cheap brushes 2 days in and it broke

I’m really upset that I bought these. I was hoping for a stiffer brush. Very flimsy and no stiffness to it.

They are really small. I am a beginner that enjoys paint nite and was looking for larger brushes. But these work fine for smaller paintings.

Awful. Wish I could get my money back. If I could rate lower I would. Completely a rip off.

Worst brushes ever! Completely falls apart during painting and cleaning.  I am so disappointed.

Misleading description making it seem like you will receive 40 instead of 20 cause it says 2 pc 20 so that was disappointing

I purchased these for a paint and sip activity for a bachelorette party. I checked out Hobby Lobby and other craft stores and these ones were the cheapest for the greatest variety of brushes. Performed well for amateur painting and easy to clean. They seemed to be durable enough for many uses.

If you run your own art classes or have kids and don't want to spend a lot on brushes, these are them. They worked perfect for my art classes. They held up perfect for all my painting needs for my students.

I loved this buy because the same brushes at Walmart are twice the price and these are cuter. They are very soft and rinse easily. My kids can grip the long handle very well.

Are perfect for my crafting projects...good price!

For the price and the amount of brushes this is a good option.  I use for general crafting with various paints and glues.  I also use to odd areas when painting walls and cabinets to get into. You get a variety of bristle shapes to fit most needs.  I've ordered this many times.  They hold up if you remember to clean them which I am bad at sometimes.

These are nice brushes and it's a good variety of sizes and shapes. I've used them to paint with tempura paints and they apply the paint smoothly and I haven't had any bristles come loose.

I only used them a few times. The bushes were nice while they lasted. They felt good in my hand and held the paint pretty well.  Sadly, the metal tops that hold the bristles to the handle fall off way too easily. When rinsing the paint off of the brushes in plain water several of them came apart. Cheap adhesive I guess.  You get what you pay for.

I got these to do face painting and it was very important to me that the brushes were soft. The kids only complaint was that the really small ones tickled. The brushes also washed out really well with no residue.

Love these paint brushes. I can paint straight lines without being concerned about uneven bristles

Very disappointed in these brushes as I was looking for ones that I could use for detail. The brush fibers are all uneven and fibers were pulled away from the rest, making extra marks where I didn’t want them. Got these because of the reviews and I’m annoyed I bought two packs because the reviews said they were so good. Maybe I got two bad batches but the next time I paint I’m going to have to order new paintbrushes. I will be paying more for quality.

Not good for painting acrylic on canvas, bristle length from feral is just a bit too long and the round brushes are really not tapered for getting in small areas with any accuracy.  You need brushes for your children, these will do.

First, the first package of them got delivered to the wrong address. Amazon replaced them for me and the ones they delivered arrived a day later than they said they would be. The brush handles themselves are sticky and just unpleasant to the touch. Not great for something that I'll have to be holding while painting... They are also VERY thick. I wouldn't call ANY of these brushes small enough for detailed painting (which is what I ordered them for).

As soon as my daughter removed the brushes from the package, one of them fell apart. The brush tip came off the handle.I had to use super glue to fix it.

No matter what kind of paint I used these brushes leave brush marks. Maybe good work a kid doing water coloring.

I am not a fan of these paint brushes at all. I bought them to paint on a canvas. Before I was even half way through my painting the bristles started falling out. I had to pick so many bristles off of my canvas it made it so difficult to paint a good picture. I’d definitely not buy these again.

These are not made to last more than just a couple of uses. They easily bend and snap apart, but for the price it isn't unexpected. I probably would spend a little more next time on better brushes though as these haven't even made it 3 months.

the shipping was without a doubt super fast, but the quality of the brushes didn’t last long. pieces of hair from the brush began coming out after a second use which effected some of my paintings. i wouldn’t recommend for those who paint faithfully. this is more of a beginners brush for young children.

I ordered these to do paint by numbers.... I was hoping for small detailed brushes along with the big ones and that is not what you get. Also the pink color is more of a white. I would not recommend these if you have smaller details to paint.

This is the type of set I would get for my nieces and nephews. I was not impressed by their quality of hair but it does the job. I would gift this to someone who is a beginners because the hairs are stiff to create great lines but soft to add texture.

Was given the wrong color but works nicely

Very thin handles, short. Disappointed

Several brushes lost hairs in paint( acrylic) but not when I first inspected them right out of the bags. Adequate for someone just starting out if you know they won't take the time to clean the brushes.

A little disappointed, they were not the brushes I saw first when ordering. Those were clear bristles and were angled. I will use these and they are good brushes, already had same, but was wanting the angled ones. Would have only bought the clear gloss otherwise.

I have only had it for a couple weeks and a brush head came off the wood handle. I've only used them twice. They are beautiful brushes and work well. Just not impressed with quality.  Not sure if I should return or buy another brand..

The paint brushes are good quality for the money but are too big for paint by number sets

Just terrible! They barely hold the paint and are difficult to get the paint off the brush onto the canvas. These may be good for kids projects but not for adult painters.

These are very cheaply made, half of them fell apart after two uses

By the photo, I thought these would be plentiful, but when they arrived, they are teeny tiny little brushes. And if there were 20 in the set, I'd be surprised. Never order again.

The heads break off during use and when I wash them. I’m glad I got as many as I did bc they are so flimsy. The head falls off of one every wash.

The only reason I put one star for the money is bc alot of the tops came apart so I had to super glue them back on

The brushes are way too soft for any fine details or lines -- I'm doing miniature work in acrylics and this purchase was waste of time.

Ok if you dont paint mich but not worth the money

Most of the brushes are fine but one of my brushes brisols all fell out before I could use it  wouldnt recommend buying.

Got double the brushes for the price of 1. The brushes are very light weight and are inexpensive. Used them with face paint and they seem very cheaply made but can make them work for now.

The bristles started falling out on these my first time using them.  The price was great but the brushes are not so great.

Not the best brushes, my set had hairs sticking out on one of the brush and another is crooked. But it gets the job done for beginner acrylic painting.

The first brush I tried to use the tip came off. I ended up taping it back on to still use it

You get what you pay for. These keep falling apart. The brush detaches from the stick part way too much.

Bristles are uneven and had what looked like old painter ink on one.

I find the brushes of poor-medium quality.  I paint every weekend and clean my brushes meticulously and I already have hairs coming out of my brushes.

The hairs were coming out the very first time I used several of the brushes. Not for serious artists.

The overall quality of the brushes is not that great. I used once and the bristles are starting to fall out after once use. I would have been better off going to Michaels.

Be careful while cleaning them. Either the bristles, or the entire brass piece holding the bristles will come off in your hand. 😭

Horrible detail brushes..not trimmed, random bristle lengths.  Not recommended for fine artwork.

Not ideal. Won't be buying again. Spend money on some actual paintbrushes. The hairs spread out within the first day I used them.

The hairs came out easy on my projects.

You press them when painting a and they brock

There are better value brush sets than this one.

The brushes are not made well. Stray fibers, fuzzy tips. Ok for little kids not for serious painting.

Good enough for grandchildren.

The brushes seem fine but they are definitely not what I purchased in the picture advertised. I’m sure they work fine, they just don’t present the way I pictured at all; I’m using these for an event, so I wanted them to look a particular way. They aren’t shimmery, they’re a flat color and more peachy looking. They also have numbers printed on them, some of which are smudged slightly.

Its ok

Lots of brushes… very generous…quality fair…no spring back on bristles.They flair out and do not return to shape… no spring in their brush.

These are great for work brushes when you don’t want to use the “good paintbrush” to apply something. Probably fine for other mediums but I’m working with watercolor

needed round tip.  most were flat

Breaks eay

These paint brushes aren’t the best in the world. They feel more like cheap number 2 pencils than paint brushes, but you get what you paid for. If you’re a beginner painter or a hobbyist then these will suffice.

Didn’t like the brushes

Brushes looked to be well-made and a great value. However, after being used a few times , bristles became misshapen and did not regain the original shape. I would not recommend for oils and solvent used in thinning and cleaning.

They work but don’t last long at all a few uses and toss them differ serious projects

I haven’t used them yet so unable to give an accurate rating

I usually buy good brushes. These I sent to my sister who is just starting out painting after a stroke. They are adequate for the present time.

For the price, these brushes do the job I need them to do. But they don't clean up well and lose their point if I look at them wrong. I think it was a good idea to get these as a beginner, but I quickly learned that I prefer spending even just a little more for one nicer brush than having a bunch of these cheap ones now loitering in my space.

These brushes are somewhat good for the price. If your looking for something cheap to use, and not particular then get these. i Recommend for beginners

the brush itself is very nice and what I was looking for. but the quality of the build is what you pay for. the handles fell off almost all the brushes immediately after opening the package. Like I said, brush quality is very nice. Honestly haven't had the chance to use them yet, so I really don't know how they hold up to the paint or thinners yet.  glue the handle back on and have a nice cheap set of brushes.

I do paint by number art and I’m always looking for a good set of brushes. These are ok but I noticed that the bristles don’t stay on to the colors very well and tend to streak and smear.

I bought these for painting miniatures. Not the best brushes, and somewhat soft (they don't have a lot of spring to them) but they suit my purposes. Probably wouldn't buy again, but they are holding up after months of use, so that is a plus!

Not sure an artist would use these.  Quality so-so

Brushes are soft witch is nice to paint with but they seem to fall apart very easily and that's the down fall mine didn't last long at all before the tops started falling off kind of bums me out

Vibrant orange bristles with peach handles.

I failed to look at this before I purchased.  But these are strictly for detail painting.  They are very small.  I will make use of them, but you need to be sure about what size you want and make sure you convert from cm to inches.  I'm glad they weren't terribly expensive.  As they are basically taklon, I'm sure I can use them as I do a lot of detail, but I really wanted a full set of larger brushes.

For little kids yes very nice.For beginning painters not recommended.They do not hold form well.

I bought these brushes because I needed some obviously and they’re okay I guess but the only thing is that the pink brushes are discolored and look more peachy instead of pink.

I purchased these for a Brain Break Activity for my Summer Music Clinic.Most of them survived, but a few of them ended up like this. My students were not in anyway rough with the brushes so not sure what caused the break. But broke on first try. I'll get new ones and different ones.

i guess it works… i will try

Was a little disappointed the handles loosen quickly and easily.  Some just falling apart.

The brushes are very stiff. I don’t see how you would be able to use them for watercolor or any fine art work. I bought them for general use in my metalsmith studio for applying liquid fluxes, patinas and firecoats. They may be a little stiff for some work but I am hoping they soften up with use. Might work well for heavy handed children’s use.

Just received these today. I ordered pink for my daughter but these are NOT PINK. They are a light peach. Don't know about the quality of the brushes yet, but disappointed with the color.

Ok. Not very sturdy for my use.

I would have liked a little bit more variety in terms of brush sizes. Cleaning them was a bit difficult as the paint sometimes would stay stuck in the bristles even after putting them in water for awhile. Great for beginners, jowever, it would sometimes get blotches on the canvas. It definitely needs atleast 1 big brush in the set since the biggest is pretty small.

They don't seem to last very long.  You get what you paid for.

They were nice and easy to work with, but when cleaning some broke. The brush came off the stick. Easy fix but still annoying

The item needs better glue to keep the thing together. During the first use the brush separated from the stick.

These brushes have worked well for me other than the colored coating flakes off of the handles and is distracting while painting. You have to watch the chips don’t fall off into what you’re painting. This happened my third time using them and every time since. They should have left the handles bare wood.

They are okay. They came in more of a peach color then a pink color. But what can I do. Wouldn't buy again.

There are 2 sets, now I know why, there aren't many in either set z c but I fit the 2 set desk because I'm buying for 2 different types of painters. One paints with water, the other paints with oil paint.

You really get what you pay for with these. They started to fray pretty quickly, and I’ve only been able to really keep a single one shaped. Not the easiest to clean paint out of either. I’d recommend spending a little bit more to get brushes that last.

Decent brushes if you aren’t looking for something very permanent. The paint on the stick of the brushes started peeling off and the head of the brush fell off a few times as well. Other than that the brushes painted really nice and smoothly for the decent quality.

These are pretty good for beginners but after a while they start to peel and sometimes u can put up with it but sometimes the chips fall on your painting and that's annoying. They last pretty long tho. I think I purchased these about 6 months ago, maybe more, and they're pretty much still standing

It is a good deal as long as you don't expect excellent quality. They serve the purpose but we lost a few on the first use when the brush heads just came off. Easy to glue back in but qualityneeds work

You get what you pay for. They're not excellent, they are stiff and not easy to use. I use them for pastry decoration so they were useful for me, but as brushes, they are worth the cheap price you have paid.

For a long time I had one of these paint brushes but I never could find the right one a Amazon really help me The bristles are nice it doesn’t really show up on the camvas

Brushes are ok for beginners but for delicate painting they seem to have too many stray hairs on them, I have to keep tweezers nearby to pluck the wild strands off .

The brushes are so flimsy that you can barely get one use out of them before they break and fall apart.

Brush heads flew off on first time use. Bristles left lots of streaks too.  Otherwise fine.

When they came in everything looked fine and once I opened the bag the bigger brushes we’re fine but the small thin ones and bristles that were all over the place and very hard to paint with

The paint brushes are stiff

it is what it is

they work well but they are slightly uneven in terms of some of the bristles are probably glued on weird, but they still work well for me because i do background paintings anyway so they don’t need to be perfect

These are not the best brushes, but let's be honest. Good brushes cost good money. We teach an art class to seniors with Alzheimer's and these are perfect for that purpose. They are solid brushes and last several months before needing to be replaced.  Sometimes the necks pop off after a few months so just know that's the quality of these. I'm so glad for them for our purposes, which is why I'm doing 4 stars here. I recommend for non-professional art classes.

Great size assortment, good quality, great price.

When the package arrived the bag was intact, but all of the paints were in the bottom of the bag and the box was destroyed inside. The products purchased were fine. But now I can’t put the paint in the box

Nice paint brushes for doing ceramic work. There's a great selection of sizes.

These look nice, good price, quality looks decent. My only issue is that they were supposed to be delivered the day after I ordered them, but the shipping kept getting delayed which delayed which hindered my project timing.

Got these to use in my craft room. The variety of sizes is perfect for my needs.

These are great little craft brushes. The fibers don't come out and stick in your project and they also don't leave brush marks as long as you take care of them. I got a double set at Amazon for less than I would have paid elsewhere. Well worth it.

Really nice and soft brushes

Works

I have been using these off and on for painting miniatures.  They work well, so no complaints there.  I will mention that I got 2 of the size  brushes instead of a size 6.  Not really a significant issue for me, but prevents me from rating 5 stars

Good a few paint & Sips!

Not the greatest quality but they’re what you expect for the price! Good for kid painting and light projects but I wouldn’t plan to do much more with them. The brush themselves aren’t very thick

I got these to paint tote bags, and they worked pretty well. The only thing is that the metal clasps aren’t super sturdy. I snapped one while cleaning it. Other than that one, they all held up. And there’s a variety of sizes, which is helpful for painting large and small details. So overall, a good set.

I bought these for my middle school classroom and overall, I'm happy with them. The construction is pretty poor; the crimping is much too loose, so you'll need to spend a while finding all the loose ones and super gluing the brushes onto the handles before kids can use them (otherwise about a third of them will just come apart). That being said, after gluing, these have worked really well for my students - the variety is great, the bristles don't fall out all over the place; for the price, I think these are a good value. I would probably buy them again for my painting class, but next time I might have kids do the gluing lol

Great value, not an expensive brush selection but for the price is great value.  A more experienced artist requiring exception results would not be happy with these less expensive brushes.

This is a great starter and budget set. They worked well. I had slightly mixed results. The fine tip 2 kept its shape well and helped me zone in my paints in tight areas. Two of the slightly wider brushes had issues with maintaining shape. The one took on the paint color. The tip is now green. Two of the brushes stopped being pliant while painting. Although the paint I used was drying quickly. Which may also be why they were difficult to clean. So, start with these and upgrade as you can.

Grandparents' Day at our center. The children were able to hold the brushes with great ease.

My girlfriend wanted to try painting for her birthday these did the trick as we're just painting for fun. Good option if you're on a budget or for your kids

This is a good set of brushes for beginners or kids.

Good

These brushes are great for youngsters they are stiff and hold their form well but do not hold a lot of paint so possibly not as messy.

They are  nice brushes for beginners and  easy to clean.

My expectations were lower that I expected. They actually work well for face painting.

The little hairs may stray or fall off into your painting (which is annoying), but I keep buying them. You get a lot for a cheap price and it’s worth it. Plus if they get ruined, I don’t feel bad throwing them away. Does it’s job.

Brushes are durable, easy to use and easy to clean.  I work on many different projects and these work just right for each one.

This seems like a nice little beginner's set, I bought these strictly for the purpose of basically junk brushes to kind of mess around with whenever I was doing watercolor painting. But if you want something that's pretty cheap and you're just starting out and don't want some super expensive high-end brush and these will work just fine as beginner brushes or just hobby brushes they pretty much serve their purpose, although one of them that's in the second picture was particularly uneven but I might have just gotten a bad one, stop being said out of all of the brushes there was only one that really was kind of uneven so that's fine to me.

These brushes would be perfect for beginners or for someone that is not doing artwork for a living. They clean up OK but they do have a tendency to lose the bristles. I probably would buy again because it is a good price if I beat one up I don’t feel bad about throwing it away.

Not terrible, they work and have good sizes, just won't last forever

Hello all, I paint miniatures for about 2-4 hours a day and I am constantly going through brushes. The ONLY good thing that these brushes are good for is the rough stuff. I legit had all of my round brushes come with their tips curled and I bought two sets. If you're trying to do detailed work I would not recommend using these, but if you're looking for a cheap stick with hair on it to lay down some quick thin coats and then when the brush is used up, using it to add the nasty stuff to your bases; You're all set.I gave them 4 stars because the tips were either curled or frayed before opening. Otherwise I would've given them 5 stars for the price and my intent with them.

Nice choices

I was surprised to see how small length and round they actually are. They're about the size of the picture themselves!

I grabbed a set to paint in tight nooks and crannies on an outdoor display and they worked perfectly. This is another product that its simply not worth the time to try and clean and reuse them again as for as cheap as they are throw it away and start with a clean fresh brush for the next color. Paints well and would recommend.

I thought this was a very good product for a 2 hour make-and-take class that I conducted.  It provided many size options to meet the needs of the students and the bristles cleaned out quickly and easily so as to move right along to the next color, etc.  However, I must say that after only about 4 or 5 rinses, the water apparently saturated the handle enough to make the blue start to flake off and that became very irritating to a lot of students as it sometimes got into their project area.  I would recommend being very careful in the washing clean process so as not to get too much water on the handles.

This product is fine for any kind of beginners

The brushes work fine with acrylic, watercolor, and powder pigments. The only complaint is that the brush metal sleeve will detach from the handle if you tug on it while washing them. Nothing a drop of superglue can’t fix, but they could have tried a little harder there 😂

Easy to hold.

Good for the price! They break easily but they're really nice for an amateur like myself.

These are great!  Just don't count on much for durability

I've painted with them two days in a row, fairly good however the some bristles are starting to stray and I'm petty sure they hold in moisture (grey water went all over one of my paintings after cleaning them and a little green paint has come out too) plus they almost instantly transition into a brownish orange color. But I am a pretty new to painting so this could be my fault.

I bought these for dry brushing since they were cheap but I ended up using these for other things as well. They are pretty good brushes for the price and pretty good for a beginner who doesn't know if they'll enjoy painting or not.

I got these because they were cheap but not *too* cheap. I needed some new brushes for an indoor mural I'm working on and these do the job. They're cheap enough that I don't really care if some of them are bad, or if they get ruined quickly.  I would recommend them for beginners, art teachers, and anyone who wants a decent brush that isnt $10 a piece and doesn't need to be *perfect*

Nice set of budget brushes, and a good value for the double set you get. These aren't super high quality, but the set includes a great variety of brushes that fit most needs for small paint needs. I use them for modelling and 3d prints that need a little extra flair, and they are awesome for that. The brushes seem well crimped, with very few hairs separating while using them, which is usually a problem with the cheaper sets. Would certainly buy these again.

I bought these for an outdoor stencil.  Didnt cost much so I threw it away when done. There are a lot of shapes to choose from which was nice,.

nice brushes

Great product for beginners. I would recommend.

Will be used for my spring/ summer project and love all the different sizes.

with this package i will have brushes for years

Can’t wait to use them

This is good quality for the low price 👍

Would recommend to any painter. Fast delivery.

These brushes are so good they nylon hair tips are of great quality and they are just a pleasure to create art with.

Use it for DYII projects

Very good

I love these paint brushes! They have sturdy wooden handles, they’re easy to clean, and come with a variety of different sizes (10 total). Love the reusable plastic case as well. I would highly recommend!

A good set for painters of all levels. Much better than the brushes that come with paint-by-numbers sets, which is what I am using them for. A great value.

Very nice product... I use them to assemble model projects with my grand-kids and we enjoy using good quality brushes...

Everything I’ve purchased has been top quality, always exceeds my expectations and delivery is always prompt and on time.

My old paint brushes were worn out so I bought these and I could not be any happier they are the perfect high quality brushes.

I made a painting for my birthday and it turned out better than expected!

Good brushes so far. Can't beat the price.

great value

Well made

like

These are great fro the price, if you keep them washes they should last fairly long! Not streaky when painting  too

They seem great no Bristles have come Out they were packaged well And they even have a little pencil case with them basically so that is helpful for storing them afterwards, along with my other paint brushes and other Tools I use for painting Pretty good variety of brushes would've preferred may be a few more smaller, fine tipped kind Brushes that were a little more square shaped But overall, pretty happy and would recommend for the price

Good selection, very nice brushes

Fun and work great

I ordered it for my daughter. The quality is super. I am 100% satisfied with the product.

I wanted to fix a few scratches on my car but realized I didn't have any small brushes so I ordered this set as it had varying sizes that I thought would be perfect. The set was inexpensive and the brushes were good quality. I used the smallest ones for the touch up and they worked perfectly. The brushes cleaned up nicely and I'm planning to use them for a few tight areas on my walls where I can't get a normal brush in. Overall very happy with this set as the bristles are just about perfect, stiff enough to put the paint where you want it and soft enough where they don't leave lines. Highly recommended.

Used these at a camp for extra face painting brushes and they were great for that!

These brush sets are well designed unlike many others that are flimsy and their bristles fray after only a use or two. These bristles have maintained their shape after many uses. Great value!

Great value and lots of variety. Very soft. Used for a kids face painting class. Also comes with a resealable container for transport.

No hairs have even up on my paintings yet! Coverage is a little lacking, but over great product, definitely buy again!

I bought these thinking it was 2 sets of 20, but it is actually 2 sets of 10- totaling 20 paintbrushes. They are good quality for the price point though. I used these for a kids paint party and they worked well for their purpose. No shedding, good coverage, and held up well even after multiple paint and washes.

You can usually tell as soon as you handle a product if it will be great or junk. From the quality packing to the construction of the brushes, this brush pack is worth a lot more than I paid. The brushes paint smoothly, are easily cleaned, and can be used repeatedly without degrading. There are multiple sizes of brushes to choose from. I will buy it again.

I wanted these for craft acrylic paint and they work perfectly! And I love all the color choices! Excellent brushes, I would recommend to a friend!

These are just like another few blue sets around here, but when I bought them, this was the most economical way to buy tons of cheap touch up brushes.

Love the price and all the different brush styles you get with these! The bristles don’t fall out despite little crafter use. They worked great with acrylics and glitter!

The brush heads are nice and clean.  No loose hairs to mess up your painting.  The brushes clean easily and are easy to hold.  I recommend these for beginner painters and kids will love them too.  The handles are good quality and I was able to use the heads of the handles to make perfect dots.Thus is a great set of brushes.

Some of the best lower-priced art brushes I've found!

Bought them to model paint.  No issues with the quality.  Variety of brush tips to allow for various detail work.  Can't beat the price point for the set.

Good buy! Would buy again, arrived on time and as described.

The BOSOBO Paint Brushes Set is a gem! With 20 pieces in 2 packs, these round pointed tip brushes are versatile and perfect for various art projects. Whether you're using acrylics, oils, or watercolors, these nylon hair brushes deliver precise and smooth strokes. They're great for face and nail art, miniature detailing, and rock painting. Plus, the blue color adds a fun touch to your art supplies collection!

Purchased these for a friend's sip and paint party.  Great quality and easy to clean.

I use these brushes with angelus paint to customize shoes and these brushes are perfect for it. They are great. No shedding and hold up well. I will continue to use the brushes.

I’m sorry, but I don’t understand these instructions…1) cut the tab guide( which I did) 2) once tab guide is detached, align the top of the tab guide flush with the top of my bible page. ( I get this part)  ONCE TAB GUIDE IS IN PLACE, MARK A LINE ON THE TAB GUIDE THAT REPRESENTS THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BIBLE PAGE. ( How can I mark a line when I was told to cut it, and the tab guide is 3 inches too short to mark a line representing the bottom of the Bible page!

They might have some sort of matte coating, but they re not "laminated" and will not last. If they had been more expensive I would retun them.

These do the job, they're just cheaply made and very flimsy. I didn't end up using mine as I found the material to be cheaply made and quite frankly- not worth the price. Feel free to use them, they get the job done but you definitely get the quality for the price.

I’ll start with the good, the font is nice easy to use, the extra tabs for writing in is creative.However!, if my purchase is to tab up the Bible chapters, that’s what I am looking for. To have 15 chapters completely gone is kinda insane. Now you would probably think oh you have extra tabs to write them in No you don’t. There are only nine of those tabs. And there is an extra New Testament in here instead of putting the correct amount of tabs in here like what am I supposed to do with a extra15 tabs from genesis to  Ezra( nothing that’s what)

This package of index tabs does not include all the books of the bible. If you buy two packages you night or might not have all the correct tabs to index one bible. Otherwise you have just ruined your bible while trying to improve it. Also the self stick tabs dont stay stuck well and tend to spring loose, having to be pressed back on, numerous times. I am very distraught,  and my bible will never be the same.In my experience installing these tabs was destructive,  rather than an improvement, because many were missing or repeated, and they keep coming loose.Would not buy again.

They look great but they won't stick, just installed them this morning and they won't even stay on. Totally worthless.I bought another brand off Amazon for a different Bible and they've lasted for months and never once detached from the page and they stick very well.You get what you pay for, definitely skip on these!

I guess you get what you paid for but these were too thin.

Was not happy with these because they did not stick. I had to actually go back after I put them on and glue them with a glue stick to make it work.

I was very excited about receiving these tabs for my new Bible. It was unfortunate to noticed there was double tabs sent for the 1st books in the Bible. Now, I have a log section without tabs. And if I pick up where I left off, the tabs for the remainder area will not be consistent with the space between the tabs. So sad.

Wanted to love these but i unfortunately received a duplicate pages and am now missing a good chunk of the Old Testament (first 15 books)

The tabs dont adhere well at all.  Even after I put a book over it, they still pop off.  I'm also missing an entire sheet of the NT, from 1Cor to James, there are no tabs at all. I've not had any luck contacting seller. I do not recommend these tabs. I now have a partially tabbed Bible where only some of the existing tabs stick.

These were useless. Unless you want to also buy glue and sit there for hours sticking glue on them, they offer nothing but the big lettering but if you can’t use them, what’s the point?

Part of the Old Testament tabs were missing. The New Testament was in there but was not able to do the tabs in the Old Testament because they were not there.

The adhesive for the tabs will not stay on the Bible pages.  When you put them on and I held it in place many times and they would still pop loose.

Very disappointed! We recieved 2 sheets of the 1st books tabs, and are missing the tabs for the last books. My daughter starting attaching them before we realized it, and there is not a tab for every book in the bible.

I was on a roll putting the tabs on my Bible when I realized there was one sheet with duplicate names and the tabs were not complete for me to finish labeling the Bible so I was very disappointed

Missing tabs from both the Old and New Testament. Missing 9 from the Old and 7 from the New Testament. I was very excited for the set and now to see I didn’t get a full set after already assembling, is very disappointing.

Product arrived quickly. Looks good however they do not stick. Spent the time applying then to my Bible only to have all of them pop off shortly after. Can't flip pages without them coming loose.

I literally had to glue the tabs to the pages. They are very cute. It is unfortunate that they are poorly constructed!

1/2 the books of the Bible were missing. I’m a sinner- I need them all 😈

Stickers are not sticking with the pages. Tabs are pretty but not doing what it's supposed to do.

The tabs arrived on time but a few are missing the titles. I will be returning and hoping to get a full set. I guess it's true you get what you pay for

Missing some of the Old Testament and a lot of the New Testaments. Can't return because I already started putting them in my bible and if I take them out to return them I would rip the pages in my bible.

As you can see in the picture, the tabs are not sticking to themselves when folded like they're supposed to. I've pressed and squeezed multiple times and they keep coming undone.

I am going to have to tape most of them down. They won't stick

We can't see the books unless you turn the Bible toward a light source.

Was going great until I got to the New Testament. All of the labels though the New Testament are misaligned so you can’t read what the tab says!

these tabs did not stick! it was a waste of time applying them, only to find them pop off! plus, they were not complete-several bible chapters were not included.

I was in the middle of tabbing my Bible and there are missing books, at least 15. ☹️ unable to return due to the tabs already on my Bible. Very disappointing.

Beautiful colors, easy to place on Bible, template not cut correctly to where more than not didn’t fold over correctly to adhere without sticker part showing.

When i sat down to adhere these tabs, i realized that a whole sheet of tabs was missing and another whole sheet was duplicated, epic fail.

I purchased this for my bible. I couldn’t return them because I put them on my bible already.  Pick another brand, not this one

Can only put 5 in a row and had to use tape to get them to stick. That’s what I get for buying cheap.

Bible tabs in different letter shapes not cohesively done. Will be returning waste of money, supposed to had been an Easter gift to myself.

Not sticky enough... I doubt they will last long.  I had to keep pressing tab back on pages...I will not pur base more!

I was so excited to try these . Applied these to my Bible and they came off. These do not stick. Extremely disappointed

Disappointed the stickers doesn’t stick too well if I try to pull them to set it right it pulled of pages of the Bible

I love them, however disappoint, because of the Blank Tabs, Missing Bible Chapters, PSALMS,  Proverbs, Song of Soomon, Ecclesiastic, , Isaiah, I will need a replacement. I will change stars if the concern is immediately remedied.

I am missing Nehemiah all the way through to Obadiah. And there aren't enough blank tabs to fill in the missing books.

This product is missing a lot of books from the Bible they send you repeated books!!! Do not buy !

Missing 16 tabs. I had already started putting them in my Bible when I realized the set was incomplete

Ugh. These don’t stick. I had to take the other side off and it’s ruining my new Bible. Bummer!!

The way these are printed some of the same colors end up being beside one another - I hated this and threw them away, went with another style - wouldn't order these or this brand again....very disappointed and wasted money!

As I was accessorizing my Bible with the tabs I noticed I’m missing 12 tabs bcuz whom ever packed the tabs doubled on the first page of tabs and left out the others ☹️

The media could not be loaded.
                



Please don't buy this because you'll end up disappointed.The colors are so cute and aesthetic but the tabs DO NOT STICK AT ALL!It was frustrating.So, it's just not worth it.

Product covers up scripture on the back side of my Bible. So don't purchase is my recommendation

I was excited about these until I opened the package. There were multiple copies of some of the Old Testament and none for the New Testament. I have nothing but regrets.

Supposed to be tabs for the chapters in my Bible, but they duplicated tabs and half of them are missing.

Disappointed that my pack of stickers was missing an entire sheet of labels.

I am disappointed because I am missing 15 books of the Bible.

I love the colors, and the font, but the SONG OF SONGS does not have a label. Instead, the label says Song of Solomon. That is not the title of the book. They do give blank labels to write your own tab, but I don’t want to mess up the flow of the printed font. I wouldnt have ordered them had I known the book title was incorrect.

Wasn't like what I expected. I wanted thick tabs because of I use my Bible alot. And I did not want tabs to be the reason for ripping off pages.

I was SOOOO excited for these trans to go in my new bible. I opened the pack and only had 2 out of 5 sheets.

I started to apply the tabs and it was all going well until I realized an entire page of tabs was missing. Can’t return because I already applied 15 of them. Word to the wise: make sure they are all there before application.

Did not find this easy at all to place in my Bible. As a matter of fact the first one I didn't even get on right so I didn't try the rest. It might be just me or it's too difficult to understand. Again that's just me

I bought these because i love the colors black and gold, however, I was disappointed because depending on your lightning they are not easy to read, there is glare...:(  and of course I cannot change them ugh...do not recommend the color black and gold, get a different color!

Item is good, but it was delivered crumpled.

I love the quality of these Bible tabs! Very easy to put on or adjust without ripping the pages. However upon inserting them to my Bible, I noticed that there are a lot of tabs are uncounted for from Obadiah to Roman. There’s also a duplicate sheet from Genesis to Ezra.Kind of disappointed.

These tabs are great! I love the quality and was really excited when attaching them to my Bible. It wasn't until I got to the book of Jonah that I realized I didn't receive the set of stickers for the last few books of the Old Testemant. Instead it came with 2 sets of the first books, Genesis - Ezra.Luckily it came with some blank ones but it sucks to have to write the names on them when all the others are pretty and printed.Other than that I really like the quality of them.

The color represented in the listing is not the same as the actual product. I bought blush, which show as having a slightly orange undertone - which would have gone well with the binders I purchased. What I got is way more pink and looks ugly with the binders. I noticed the price went down since I bought them last week. I understand why. At least I'm not out a lot.

The tabs are nice and easy to read.  However the package I received does not have the first 15 books of the Bible...Genesis through Ezra.  Disappointing.

While the quality of the index tabs are nice they sent me two pages of Obadiah-Romans and no Genesis-Ezra. Missing the first 15 books of the Bible tabs now.

Very thin a rip easy.

Liked the tabs, easy to read.  Unfortunately the glue (adhesive) was very poor.  I had to go back and apply glue to about 29 of the tabs.

These bible tabs are printed on thicker paper than the other sets I have ordered. I don't like how thick they are compared to the thin bible pages. I also had trouble folding them in half evenly and getting them to stick.Pluses: easy to read, good colors

I like the product, they seem sturdy and easy to read. However I do not have all the tabs I need. I got a duplicate of the page from Genesis to Ezra. I do not have Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, & Romans from the New Testament.I do not have Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, & Malachi from the Old Testament.

The tabs are nice looking and feel durable, but I'm missing 15 or so tabs from my order. Obadiah through Roman's was missing, but there was a duplicate sheet of Genesis through Ezra......clearly a mishap, but a bummer all the same.

I got two of the same page of stickers.  The Gemini page is missing.  There are 66 stickers but a duplicate of the Jonah page.  Should I  return or will you send a replacement?

These are easily peeled off once they're applied they don't line up right when folded. They came bent and would not straighten out all the way. Definitely would not recommend

Bought these for a gift Bible. No matter how hard I press on them when installed within a few minutes they come unstuck. Buy something else

The Bible tabs are not a complete set. The first 17 chapters were not included and there are 2 sets of the same one

Did not realize these stickers were missing until I got to those books. By this time I had already spent  and hour and a half putting the stickers on my Bible! Now I have to pay for another set just to get the last few books!!!

I have 2 of the same page, so I do not have tabs for the last books of the New Testament. Disappointing that I tabbed my entire Bible and cannot match with the final books.

Tabs started at Nehemiah. Whole first half of the  bible is mia.

Item arrived defective. I got 2 of the same, missing half the Bible books. Please send me the second half thanks

Was missing 15 books, beginning with Genesis. Had doubles of another.

Product was fine but no card board or support for product in shipping package so was terribly wrinkled when shoved into mailbox.

The order was missing a few tabs. Started toput them on and realized I didn't have all of them. I hope the replacement set has them all

Missing books and got a duplicate page of books.

I did not receive all the Tabs needed to complete the Old Testament or beginning of New Testament.

Easy to install. Print and color doesn't stand out to read easily.

Received duplicate tabs for the Old Testament but Missing tabs for the Old Testament.

I like the tabs but I was missing a page and now can't finish 😭

Old testament tabs missing some tabs repeated

Too complicated to assemble.

These tabs were so easy to apply using the tan guide. They are all spaces nicely and easy to read. My Bible can do 5 in a row, then start again from top. If I use the 5th in the row, I can easily look and turn the whole section to look at the next 5. I can find what I need quickly and daily. The tabs are nice and firm so not flimsy at all. I did make a mistake on one before sealing both sides, and I was able to reposition without damaging the page.All my tabs included every chapter, and even had a few blank ones of alternating colors.Tabs stick out only slighty from cover, so should not get easily damaged.The gold lettering can be hard to read in certain angles, but a quick reposition and it’s fine.Great value for money for a nice quality product

Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these Bible tabs. Very sturdy and instructions are easy to follow. Love the colors - they go perfectly with my rose gold Bible.

Love these tabs! The colors are pretty, not garish. The font is easy to see and large enough for my older eyes. Bought these for a new study bible & am so glad. I didn’t use every tab, just enough to mark some of the chapters, which makes everything easier to find.  I like the subdued color scheme for the tabs which don’t detract or overwhelm the eye. I’ve never used tabs before but really appreciate having these in my new study bible.

Love the colors on these, and easy to read. Quality and Very easy to put on. Ordered another set for my other Bible.

These tabs are easy to install. They are cute and strong. They are the perfect size and dont weigh too much. If u mess up applying they come off with ease.

First, IRL the colors are sort of dusty neutrals. The tabs are all the same size, and the font is clean and easy to read. But, those who are picky about the printing should know that the font differs in at least 2 and maybe 3 ways:1) every book of the Bible is spelled out rather than abbreviated which results in JOB being 24 pt font, while Song of Solomon is 5 pt. Don't take that literally, font fans. My point is that the tab labels are very different (and inconsistent) font sizes.2) Depending on the tab color, some fonts are printed in white, others black. It works visually, but may drive some batty.3) I can't swear to it because maybe it's just the font size, but I think some of the tabs may be different fonts? Or maybe that's my set. Doesn't bother me, but may bother someone.That's all aesthetics, here's how they perform in action: I'm a fast flipper when it comes to looking up scriptures because usually by the time I've processed 'Colossians,' the person is already midway through reading it. Point being: I'm not always gentle with the tabs and yet, they remain firmly attached and I haven't accidentally ripped any off while on a furious finding mission.Otherwise, they work as you'd expect, seem to hold up to regular use, and were priced reasonably. Recommended if you need a set.

Is super cute tabs for your Bible have been a huge help in finding various things in the Bible. So easy to apply, the appearance Is so cute (You have many color options to choose from). The size is perfect and the thickness makes it good quality. Should have purchased this years ago.

The only issues I had was the tabs came undone a couple times. So the adhesion is not the best but I just kept sticking them back and added some weight on them. They finally seem to be sealed but I’m not sure for how long. They are a great addition for me to have for beginners, they fit perfect and I think they make it look so cute ! I love them !

I was hoping I could buy a new Bible with these kind of tabs already on it but I didnt have any luck.  So I hesitantly purchased these tabs hoping I wouldn’t mess up my new Bible.  The template provided with the tabs was awesome!  I quickly and easily got the tabs added and they look great!

These tabs are beautiful to LOOK at. The colors blend well together, and the way that they are set up, is a wonderful idea, as long as your Bible is the size that allows 5 tabs in a row, (an 8.6" Bible is perfect), but your tabs won't look like the photo, for example, if your Bible is Large, and you need to use 6 tabs to fill your template sizing, then the color combination that they show in the photo will be mixed. It took me 3 purchases to get a good set of tabs. The first set that I purchased had a noticeable white line going all the way down one group of tabs, and the MFG. replaced those, but when the replacement group came, they had gotten badly CREASED in shipping, so I ordered a third set, which were fine. Here is the PROBLEM. Beauty aside, the packaging comes in 8.5 X 11-inch sheets of tabs. Most companies make the pages half that size. The 8.5 X 11 sheet makes them vulnerable because they ship them in a BAG of some sort, either bubble or thick paper, with NO CARD STOCK inside the package of tabs for SUPPORT of the product, which many times causes them to bend easily. The tabs themselves are MUCH thinner stock than other competitive brands, like Mr. Pen, and they are a bit "flimsy" when working with them. At first, I liked the nicely squared lines of the edges of the tabs, since it seemed like it would be easier to fit them very squarely into place. Not true. I am a quilter, and I am very sensitive to exact measurements. Every tab has 2 edges on either side of the tab, which should be squared nicely, but 1 side is about a 16th of an inch OFF, so when you go to put the tab in, it doesn't line up squarely with your printed text in your Bible, and if you push it so that it is nicely straight with the writing in the Bible, then it is Crooked when you go to close the tab, folding it to make it stick in the Bible. You are constantly correcting, to make it squared and make it look nice. I am a perfectionist, and the overall look of the Bible with the tabs in place was definitely BEAUTIFUL, since the group of tabs were placed on a Bible that was Grey in color, with the Crown of Thorns Etched in Black, so the esthetics of the entire piece was really nice.  This company has the right idea, but they should put some cardboard in their package, so that the product is less vulnerable to aggressive shipping clerks.  Also, with a product this beautiful, if it were my company, I would make the tabs themselves just a tiny bit thicker or even make them laminated for durability. I have my concerns that these will not hold up under heavy use. It's a shame, because the tabs themselves really are pretty!!

These Bible tabs have really nice colors, most of them are large print which helps some one with impaired vision to read them easily..with that being said, they don't stick to the pages too well..a few of them keep popping up, which is an annoyance..I thought about using some kind of glue but that may damage the pages.. I wouldn't recommend these and I won't be ordering from this seller again.!

I got and applied these, easy to do, but some of them 1 in about every 6 didn't want to stick very well. I had to redo those ones (About 10 in total). Love the colors and font. I just wish they were stickier so that I didnt have to tape those ones down.

These tabs are really cute and easy to apply but beware when buying these! Pages were missing and unfortunately didn’t realized till halfway threw, Amazon sent me another order and luckily the ones I needed were in there but it was missing other pages that I already had.. seems like there’s no quality control when they are packaging these. I’d rate them 5 stars if it wasn’t for that also it says laminated these are NOT laminated.

For the price the tabs are really cute and good quality but unfortunately I had missing tabs. I got sent a double page of the same tabs and missing the tabs from genesis to Ezra.

They are so beautiful. And stick well.However - missing a BUNCH of books!!! And a received a page of duplicates. I guess having a few blanks worked but now it looks weird having some nice typed and some written.

The only reason I give 3 stars is because of packaging. All of the tabs sheets were folded to fit in shipping package. So all the tabs and surrounding tabs in the fold crease were crinkled making it very difficult to line up tabs when folded on pages. Tabs were good.

So pretty! Just what I was looking for!HOWEVER, the tabs are not very durable. After only 2 weeks the tabs have shown wear/damage. Not sure how long they will hold up.

The tabs are very "busy" and it makes it hard to read.  They seemed cheap to me.  I ended up not using them and buying a differnt product.

I love these stickers, but the last page was either printed or cut wrong. The cut of the sticker cuts off the name. I can’t label the last 6 books in my Bible and can’t use any of the blank stickers. A little disappointing.

I love now with these tabs I am able to find the chapter that I need without searching forever. And the color code is great

Unfortunately, when I opened this package and attempted to put the first one on, it was printed wacky so that part of the word was off the tab. So, I gave them three stars because of that. Had to send them back.

Some of the the tabs don’t stay stuck together. They pop open and stick to other pages. Would not recommend

Most of the New Testament books were missing. So disappointing! Other than that, they look great.

The dark purple tabs were not printed center and are close to being cut off which sucks because the tabs were so pretty and were mostly on my Bible

The tabs are beautiful but I was missing a whole sheet for the books of Obadiah through Romans. I had a duplicate sheet of the tabs starting with Genesis. Had to send them back. Hopefully they fix this issue.

They all look alike - blend in

You cannot touch these tabs to the pages (or anything else) unless you are positive of your positioning. You cannot reposition them or even remove them once they touch the pages. The degree of stickiness is so strong that it is hard to remove the tabs even from your fingers .

I received my order the labels are great and I love them however I was missing 1 sheet of labels.

The media could not be loaded.
                



The text on the tabs are not centered & some got cut in the tab

Pretty colors but mine came without Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and Romans.

Beautiful colors, sturdy paper. Missing atleast 5 different chapters.

It was missing a sheet of tabs. I need the sheet with Obadiah thru Romans.

The package comes with blank labels as well. I'd rather have all the labels preprinted.

They were oversized for my Bible.

These were really nice tabs, especially for the price, however my older eyes struggled to read the gold foil names on the tabs, and given that these were going on my thick and heavy study bible, tilting it back and forth to read the tab names was not idea.  If you have great eyesight I highly recommend these.  I also like you can put in sections of five tabs and have tabs lined up by color.  Very pretty.  Also lightly laminated.

I really like my tabs, but, it's hard to read them. The light reflects off of the gold and I have to shade them to see the titles. I set them up with the card that they gave me, but I still didn't get even lines. One thing I really liked - if I got it in a wrong place, I could easily pull it off and put it where it should be.  Despite the trouble reading the tabs, if I pull my Bible open to be close to the chapter I want to be it's easier to see.  I have other Bibles that don't have tabs and I can easily find where I want to be, but this Bible is new and has a lot of stuff in the back, so the Bible part is the first half, so I was having trouble getting to where I wanted to go, the tabs have helped a lot.

I loved the color scheme of these Bible tabs. Worked perfectly with my Bible. Love the guide that came with these so you can line up your Bible evenly

These are very pretty and add a nice splash of color to my NLT Bible. They are not thick when placed and they are not too large. I found the application guide to be unhelpful. I just placed the tabs and lined them up with each other. Other than the application process I would recommend the product.

The quality and colors of the tabs are nice, and the directions for the tab aligner are helpful.  I took off 1 star because the colors are out of order (some repeat in a row and not for books where there’s multiple parts), so it makes the finished product look unorganized.  It might not be a problem to some people, but it aesthetically bothers me.

These tabs were the perfect addition to my new study Bible. Easy to apply and love that they easy to read.

A little bit harder to install than others I have used. Other than that, they look good.

Really like the color but I kept having to repress a few times due to them falling off the pages

Easy for me to find the books in the bible.  Nice tab colors, definitely serves its purpose.

The tabs are nice but the words are too lite.  With the print on the tabs,  the ink should have been a dark color.

This makes finding everything so easy. Sometimes the tabs loosen. I still like having them.

I’m not happy about it honestly. I’m missing tabs for Obadiah all the way through Romans. Makes my Bible look so idk not organized. Just not happy, but the colors are so cute! Aside from missing tabs my Bible looks so beautiful. Wish I had the other tabs to make it look neater.Update: the seller did reach out to me and sent me another packet which had all the tabs in it. However when I tried to remove the old ones it did make some tears. But they were covered up by the tabs. Just be careful removing tabs if you need to. They can cause the thin pages of the Bible to tear

These are great! They come with guide and looks great once put in. Makes looking up verses be very easy.

I love them , there are no damages.The only dissatisfaction I have is that I am missing1 pack of the Boho transparent Sticky Note.

The tabs were super easy to put it on since it comes with a paper guide you can cut off and use on your Bible to know where to place them. If you mess up don’t worry they come off easily and don’t rip the paper, they’re a great fit they don’t look big on the side of the Bible so I love that! They look super cute very nice neutral pallet that I chose. Excellent way for me to easily find my place in the Bible! I recommend it to everyone even if you already know where all the books in the Bible are from Genesis to Revelation.  It also comes with 9 extra tabs.

It was not what I was expecting and it tears easily.

These are so cute and I love them. But I did open my Bible after putting these together and one tab lifted and stuck to another page which I got off carefully but it’s still great.

The tabs are very good but be sure to apply pressure momentarily when adhering to pages because the adhesive is not that strong.

Wanted to be a me to get to the books faster & learn them, this helps a lot

Overall easy application and easy to read ~

Color was a match. Foil letters are beautiful. Extremely easy to apply with the template. Only struggle I had was making sure I didn't go too deep to cover the text.

I love pink, and these are really attractive. I am not sorry I bought them, but I probably would not buy again, or would have bought something different had i known. The lettering is in Gold Foil on what I would describe as a dusty rose. If you have good non-glare lighting, it should be fine, but if you have old eyes like me, you may want to think twice. Still, they are gorgeous, and I enjoy them

Very fast!! An there nice

People who saw me putting on the tabs loved the colors. They are nice. Easy to apply, however some did not want to stay glued down. I’m hoping that pressure on my Bible will help them stick.

Used this product on my woman study Bible . It came out great . I feel like the tabs can be a little more durable.

Not as sturdy (thick) as I expected but they seem pretty durable and cute! It was easy to put them in too.

Tabs work great very sturdy and your able to reposition it without ruining the pages.

I love the esthetic of these tabs. However, I got 2 pages of the first 15 books, and am missing Obadiah through Romans. Not enough blank tabs to correct this either. 😕

They are very cute! I would just be careful when applying them because they are super sticky and if you accidentally stick on in a spot you don't want it, it's nearly impossible to move it without ripping your pages. So as long as you're extra careful I would highly recommend!

This was a good buy. The price was reasonable and the letters were of a good size, very easy to attached.

Tabs are just a little bit flimsy.

Did not have the tab “Jude” had all other but that one.

Great for the price I paid but wish they were a little sturdier.

These are a great quality and very pretty. VERY pleased.

nice

I can see what they say. Like the blanks also.  No problems.

Bought two different sets of tabs (different sellers) for my children so it’s easier to tell the Bible apart. These are easier to apply than the other ones but not enough blank tabs for all the chapters. I had to use extra from the other set. If you’re not using a Catholic Bible you should be ok but if you are I’d opt for something else.

I really liked how easy the went on but I didn’t notice that one side is white and one is black until after. If you try to take them off after you close it they will rip your Bible so e very careful of you choose to take them off

I noticed as I was putting the tabs on. I'm missing a sheet of tabs from Obadiah-Galatians. Got a 2nd sheet of Genesis-Ezra tabs. Other than that I like the tabs, and tab guide.

Work good. A little big but functional

The Tabs are beautiful! I’m so glad that I bought them! 👍🏾👍🏾

Easy to apply, easy to read and affordable.

They are very strong and don’t break easily and they have very cute colors and stick really well to the pages of my Bible. Nice almost nude colors, very calm.

would have liked them to be laminated but otherwise beautiful and fast delivery. Many thanks. Sammy

wish i could buy more then one. have a wife and a friend that would love some bible tabs. oh well guess i'll take my business elsewhere for the other two

Not a bad product. Had them for several months and they are still holding strong. When I was putting them on I did mess up a little bit, but they are able to be peeled off easily and put back on how you see fit.

These bible tabs are strong not flimsy. Easy to install with the alignment guide. If you mess up and put it in the wrong spot it doesn't rip the bible pages if you carefully peel it off. Place in correct spot and it sticks perfectly in place.

Very cute and easy to apply! Do be prepared to take a few hours out of your day to apply them all!! Has a lovely end look

Beautiful Colors, Find books easily, and helps you stay organized. But you have to add them slowly because if you don’t you can mess them up.

As you get older it very hard to read little tabs to separate the books of the Bible. I just finish putting them on one of Bibles, and I find them very easily now. Just order to more set's of different colors.

My daughter recently received a new Bible, and I purchased these Bible tabs to go with it. She uses them to quickly find the right place in the Bible. The tabs are a great help, and I'm glad I bought them.

They’re very easy to put on and they’re big font. I’m so glad I found these

Very pretty ombré bible tabs!

Easy to install! Stays on! Big help for seeking God’s word! Amen!

Very helpful for finding the books

I had two bibles to tab, so I bought these and another color.- which, unfortunately, was a different brand. These were far and above easier to apply than the other brand.  Note the close-up from the Amazon page and see the grooved line across the middle - this ensures a PERFECT fold, with no chance of misaligning the edges. I was so happy with these. I did not even realize how much until I used the other brand and was disappointed.  Had I known that having that pre-scored line was so helpful in even folding, I would never have bought the other brand.  Funny, but this brand should mention that in their item description, because it really makes a difference.  Much neater.

Love the colors and the large print Really easy to install too

Great quality

They are very nice and easy to use with the instruction sheet to guide you

These worked really well. They were labeled very nicely and they look very good with the type of Bible I bought

The Bibles are quality product and great starter Bibles.

I could have done a better job of placing the tabs on but it was my first time nonetheless I love them

These tabs are perfect and I didn’t even realize they would match my rainbow bibles I can find the chapters so much easier now, got some for my sons bible also

This are so cute, so easy to put on and I lined mines with out the measurement chart. And the colors are light.

I'm very pleased with these tabs. They are aesthetically pleasing and are very good quality.

I didn’t place them quite the way I should have but they’re still helpful and pretty.

There were awesome!

Great shipping, item arrived in perfect condition. Would buy from again and recommend to others.

These are easy to use, cute colors and good quality

very pretty , thats it lol

Nice to be able to find scriptures without looking for page numbers

I've bought these 2 times now & they work great! Sturdy but not heavy that it'll tear the page over time.

These worked out perfect for my new Bible. They go on easy.

Love these. Helps me to find scripture faster.

Large print was just what I needed. Colors are very pleasing. Easily applied to my Bible.

Great product with fast shipping!

Yea, I'm in loveeee. So pretty. The tabs are hard and not flimsy. I only use the ruler for like 4-5 tabs and after that I just free balled it. I used a reference for the previous tabs I layed on the pages before for the pages after and so on so forth. This overall roughly took me around 2 1/2 hours give or take. I had so much fun as well, just seeing the tabs increase more on the page and the ombre coming into play. MUST BUY.

Easy to install , easy to remove if you make a mistake. These tabs are thick and sturdy. They fit perfectly

The product was very nice to add to my bible! It makes for  easier access to finding different books when studying!

Very easy to use.

Quality product for a good price. Easy to use

These tabs are such a nice added touch to my bible! They were very easy to attach! Very happy with them!

These worked great!

My daughter wanted tabs for her Bible. These were easy to apply with the included guide, and they've held up to summer use.

Thank you😊

These are fantastic quality with very helpful instructions would definitely order again.

First time I bought some sticky notes that don’t stick. Terrible performance. They literally have no adhesion and the stickiness falls right off 5 min after putting it in a surface. I had them on a stick note screen for computers. Made specially for sticky notes. They look nice but serve no purpose. Disappointed consumer

THESE PADS HAVE 1/3 THE # OF NOTES THAT HIGHLAND, POST IT, OR ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE EVER ORDERED. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE TOOK 30% OF THEM OUT.  I TRIED TO FIND THE # PER PAD IN THE OTHER BRANDS BUT COULD NOT, CLEARLY IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THIS BRAND. I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY IT'S PRICED THIS WAY, BUT VERY ANNOYING TO NEED TO RE-ORDER BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I GOT 4 PADS INSTEAD OF 12.

I only received 8 out of the 12.The color is off, not as black as shown.THEY DO NOT STICK TO ANYTHING.it's a sticky note it's supposed to stick but doesn't.

It could have been the packaging crew but they were bent when I got them. The quality isn't the best.

These sticky notes are about a 1/3 of the amount of notes per pad than other brands. There is 12 in the pack I bought and it is more like 6 of the normal sticky pads. This seems like a great deal until you realize it is a rip off.

Spilled some water and I had a few on my desk on the edge and didn't realize they got wet.  Now my desk is permanently bright pink despite cleaning over 20 times. I will have to do a full refinish to fixYou get what you pay for!

Spend the extra money and get name brand post its. These do not stick to anything. Absolutely terrible!

What good is a sticky note that doesn't stay stuck!!!!  Really bad product - better off spending the extra money to buy the real things.

They don't stick to anything, another ripoff that Amazon still sells

paper is garbageand it dose not stickso it useless

They don’t stick, they come off after like 5 minutes

Don’t waste your money. They’re great colors but don’t stick.

These 12 pads are not the usual thickness of every other post it note style pads you have purchased before.  They are .042mm thick, which is 1/64 of an inch thick (not even 4/16ths thick).  THE ENTIRE STACK OF 12 pads is about 2 1/4" thick!!

These do not stay stuck to my monitor.  The post-it note brand sticky notes are much better!

They are not sticky in the slightest.

The sticky part of the sticky note will not stick to any thing... disappointed

They won't stick to anything.

do not stick

very bad quality, bent, and the quantity is only 1/4 of the regular one, much thinner than in Staples, this is a scam. absolutely not worth it.

I tried to go the cheap route and bought these sticky notes. They’re terrible. Don’t stick to any surface at all! As soon as you pull it off from the note pad, they lose their stickiness. Don’t be like me, don’t go the cheap route!

The colors are pretty but they are small & not sticky at all. 3/10 & the 3 is for the color

Very thin packs of notes not as represented in the photos of advertising! Haven’t opened because I will return them! Very disappointed.

Waste of Money.. Don't Buy !! They do NOT stick !They went in the garbage since I missed my window to return.

Hated these! They are terrible. They don’t stick to anything and they curl up so bad after you take one off. Spend a little extra to get a better brand than this one. I’ll probably give these to my kids to play with.

If you plan on putting these sticky notes on the wall to help you, find a different product. Within an hour of putting them up and pushing them on several times, they started falling off. Now I need to do all of my notes again. I think I will stick with the name brand products.

These won’t stick very long at all (I jotted noted on a few and they each dropped off in less than 1 minute from hanging them) so they’re absolutely pointless for what I needed.

I just stuck this sticky note on my computer and it’s already peeling off. I literally just ripped it off the pad and put it on and my computer service is not dirty or dusty either. It also did the same thing on a different color. And it fell as I was typing this review …

My bad.  I thought I was ordering full size sticky notes.  Should have read the description better and counted a normal pad.  You get a few.

No stickiness

The post it’s had discoloration and they didn’t stick. I put them in the garbage as they are terrible. I have no way of returning them.

So sad.  Not enough sticky on the edge.  Won't stay on.

Stick with name brand post it's. These don't stick.

They fall off of everything - paper or plastic.  Do not buy!!!

This was very disappointing. Not only is the package small and contains very little sticky notes. Once you peel the sticky note off of each other, they lose all of its sticky ability and won’t stick to anything else.

Doesn’t stick

These sticky notes do not stick. They fall off immediately

I like the colors. The paper is very thin and not sticky enough. The second you put the sticky note on, it falls off. 👎🏻

Spend the extra money and get name brand .Post-it notes these things don’t stick to anything

Not sticky and paper is thin. Don't waste your money.

They work fine, but you get half the amount, so it is NO deal.

These stickies don't stick. Like, not at all. They might as well just be slips of paper.

They don't stick to anything...they suck...I want my money back😑

These barely stick onto anything for more than a few minutes.

These sticky notes are not very sticky. They are just notes

Not sticky at all

Don't waste your time or money. These don't stick well and will just fall off after a short time!

Not enough sticky.

While these are inexpensive, they are not sticky at all.

Not sticky at all 0-10

Barely sticks on anything

I was looking for a lot of different colors for a student-based exercise (so teams could be differentiated by color) and picked these.  After all, what's the difference between brands of 3x3 sticky notes?  Well, these guys are pretty, but they do not stick to whiteboards or other surfaces that are vertical.  So I guess they are okay if you only plan to use them as document markers (and keep those documents flat).  But really?

While I love the colors, I would not buy these again. They are hard to write on (a waxy finish) and their adhesive doesn't last. Each sheet is also thicker than expected, so when peeled off of pad, it will keep a "curl" that makes it even harder to get full contact with the surface you want to attach note to. In the future, I will "stick" to Post-It notes.

These are pretty colors and cheaper than name-brand post-its, however they are not very sticky. When you pull them off the pad, they curl and fall off things easily. Not really a sticky note if it doesn’t stick. Would not purchase again.

Good price and great colors but these do not stick. I would stick them on the doors or fridge as a reminder and find them on the floor 15 minutes later. Will not waste my money on these again.

From the add, you think you are getting full size post it notes (from their picture).  12 Pads...12 very small pads.

I love the color of the sticky notes but they do not sticky to anything.

They aren’t very sticky once you take them off the pad.. kinda disappointing.

I put reminders on my computer every day and I have to use tape to keep them up

These peel up while being posted on a surface. Unfortunate, because these are fun colors.

These are not sticky enough which defeats the purpose

So like do they stick ….. no but I can write on them and my adhd ain’t as bad but like isn’t that the point

I am returning this and buying the same quantity a half of the price

These Stickie Notes easily break apart.  I would not purchase again.

These are Not as sticky as most post it's, didn't know they sold bad ones

You receive about one-third of the size of a regular sticky note. Refer to the picture above for a comparison between what you expect and what you get.

Cute colors but they have zero sticking power. Falls off in less than 5 minutes

I loved the colors and use a lot of sticky notes at work so tried these because of the cost. Definitely got what I paid for, don't go cheap but better ones. They do not stick very good at all, seemed like at first they may but then stickies started falling and forget about re-sticking if you move it, it won't happen.

When you take one off the pad, they tend to curl up

This pads of notes where about half the thicknessWhat of a real post it pad. NOT at all worth the price paid for them. Very disappointed.  Paper is very flimsy.  Adhesive is sub par

These sticky notes fell off my mirror within an hour

Less then I expected

These are fine if you just want a notepad. If you need to stick them anywhere don't purchase. For me they were useless.

You get half the number of sticky notes than the other ones. Nice colors, but I will not buy them again.

I bought these because they seemed like a good value compared to Post-It notes, but there is reason they are cheaper. I have post it notes that have been on my wall for almost 8 months, but almost ALL of this brand fell off within 24 hours. Not worth it. Buy the good ones.

Ordered these a week or so ago - started using them today and instantly notice how very weak the sticky is in these sticky notes. the edges start peeling after sticking them to anything.Honestly I'm thinking of just tossing the whole package not worth the hassle if I have to pick them off the floor

Have not used them as sticky notes. They won’t even stick together to firm a pad. I made a folder(book style) to keep them. Just pick up the folder and notes begin to fall off!

I was so excited to get these as I need sticky notes for work and although the colors are PRETTY they are not sticky AT ALL. I have them on a flat glass surface & they keep falling off. It’s so disappointing. I would skip these

Note that these are not the usual thick stack but 50 sheets. Never saw thin ones like this and didn't think to check the sheet count so I overpaid. Won't buy again.

Disliked the sticky wore off after awhile. I am using them to keep track of crochet pattern instructions.

Not what the picture looks like. I thought there would have more sticky notes per bundle

These sticky notes are thin and don't stick to anything other than each other or paper. It was too good  to be true for that price.

THE PICTURES SHOW LARGER THICKER PACKETS, THESE ARE SUPER THIN. I FEEL ROBBED.

Not sticky enough!

Pretty colors does not stick!

Should have gotten name brand. These fall off after an hour.

I love the variety of colors but this DOES NOT STICK FOR LONG!!

The weight of this paper is VERY thin.  If you are expecting 3M quality, you'll be diappointed.  I also felt that the tack would not last more than a few times.  I pressed a note against another piece of paper and then lifted it again about three times before the adhesive began to lose its tack.  While you want the ability to remove a sticky note without leaving any damage, you also expect them to stay in place without popping off.  I did try several types of pens and pencils and did not have any issue with the pens running themselves dry over the paper, so that is a plus.I received these through the VIne program.  Had I paid for them, I would have either returned them or made a note to self not to purchase again and just pay more for the name brand.  Some generic products are just as good but this is not one of them.  I'd still be willing to try off brand alternatives, but this is not THE one.

Sure, there's plenty to be happy about with this pack of sticky notes: it's bursting with color like a confetti cannon, and you get a generous pile of pads for the price. But, unfortunately, when it comes to the most important quality – actually sticking – these notes fall flat (literally).Sticking? Not So Much: My biggest gripe is the adhesive. I eagerly slapped these notes onto my trusty whiteboard, ready to conquer my to-do list with rainbow flair. But within minutes, they were peeling off like shy wallflowers at a high school dance. This wasn't just one rogue note – it was a mass exodus. My whiteboard looked like a crime scene of sticky note confetti.Colorful, Sure, Useful? Not Really: Don't get me wrong, the vibrant colors are a bright spot. They can certainly add a little fun to your note-taking world. But if they can't even hold their own on a smooth surface, their usefulness feels pretty limited. I can't imagine trusting these to stick to anything less forgiving like a notebook or fridge door.The Verdict: While the quantity and color variety are tempting, the abysmal sticking power makes these notes a no-go for me. Unless you're planning on crafting origami sticky note butterflies (which admittedly could be kind of cool), I'd skip these and find a brand that can remember where it was put.2 out of 5 stars (mainly for the pretty colors)P.S. If anyone has any recommendations for truly sticky sticky notes, hit me up! My whiteboard and I are desperate for reliable pals.

These stickies don’t stick. They will stick for a few minutes and fall off. Don’t waste your money.

Theyre nice, pretty good thickness. I use sticky notes for my meal preps and class as well so this is a good deal for the amount

These Sticky Notes are like the thrift shop find of the stationery world. Just don't expect them to stick around for too long...literally. It's like they're allergic to adhesive. But hey, who's complaining when you've got a rainbow of notes at your disposal for the price of a coffee.

Good quality sticky note with lots of fun colors. These are great for back to school. I have not noticed them falling off easily nor any edge curling as compared to the name brand sticky notes. Great way to cut costs without losing value.

The sticky notes come in a great variety of colors, but the adhesion is not the best, and they curl after you rip them, even if you rip them away from the side per the instructions. They're find sticky notes for casual use though.

Excellent!  Love these, and such fun colors!

The colors are neat and pretty, but they are not sticky at all in my opinion. I have to press really hard on the sticky note to try to stick and then just with vibrations. It falls off and I have to reapply. It. It is frustrating and honestly, I’m going to attempt to return them because quality is bad for what I needed to be. 2 1/2 stars honestly

Excelent

These come in beautiful colors. They don’t stick well but I like them anyway

They work good, not the stickiest.. just make sure you peel it off right, there are instructions

Not as thick as post it notes but stick fine and work well for the purpose.  They do not curl and stick well.

These come with instructions to peel sideways so you dont ruin the top adhesive part however they still dont stick very well on surfaces. I just keep my notes on the pad now without tearing them off. The good thing is this does come with a lot of stickies. Just wish they stuck!

Due to the thin paper and the adhesive used, these sticky notes aren't very repositionable. Once they're stuck down, they tend to lose their stickiness if removed and reapplied multiple times, which limits their versatility.On the plus side, these sticky notes are quite affordable, making them a budget-friendly option for everyday use. While they may not be the most durable or versatile option out there, they get the job done at a reasonable price.

More colors

These are cute colors, but they don’t stick well AT ALL, I use them for notes near my work computer monitor and they are constantly falling off and not sticking. Super annoying.

Splurge and get quality sticky notes. These curl up. I wouldn't recommend them.

Mult colored Post note padsIt’s what I expected from the product

Economical and come in a variety of colors, but not as sticky as name brand. If you need them to stick these would not be my 1st choice, but get job done for scribbles and quick notes.

Came as advertised, 12 colors, each package of 50 notes, economical and more colors.

I'm fine with the price and I am glad they aren't normal size with the normal number of sheets because I'd never use that many in a million years. But I just wanted to warn you because the photo is misleading and it doesn't mention the thickness of the pad, only the 3x3 page size. I also love that they are not accordion, all the sticky ends line up together.

They do not stick well and curl  as soon as they are stuck to something. So first they curl and then they fall off. These really are cheap.

I love the colors but it does not stick well.

If you need them to adhere to anything vertical (a wall at school, for example), they're not sticky enough to stay long. Go ahead and pay extra for the better brand.

I really like the colors and the amount that you get but they’re not sticky at all. About a minute after sticking them to something they fall off

They are durable little pads and fun colors but the sticky doesn't stick lol. Good pads and price over all but they are supposed to be sticky.

Quality and colors are goodFor the price

Great value you get a lot of them but they don’t stick unfortunately Better to use in a note book not for wood plastic metal

Stickiness not that great

I'd rate these sticky notes at a 3/5. While they certainly have their merits, there are a few drawbacks worth noting. Firstly, the adhesive isn't as strong as other brands, which can be a bit frustrating when trying to ensure notes stay put. Additionally, some of the sticky notes arrived with white lines printed across them, which seems to be a manufacturing error and detracts from the overall aesthetic. Lastly, while the designs are cute, the colors aren't as vibrant as expected, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, they get the job done, but there are some improvements needed in terms of stickiness and quality control.

These generic post it notes are thinner than name brand & even thinner than W-mart branded post it notes.  If that doesn't matter to you, then they will be fine.  They seem to stick OK.Decent assortment of colors.  1/2 pastel - 1/2 brightsNot perfectly square.  The usual quality that I expect in a basic office product is lacking.

The sticky notes in this set boast vibrant and eye-catching colors, making them visually appealing for various uses. However, while the colors are bright and attractive, I've found that they don't adhere as well as the name-brand counterparts. Despite being labeled as sticky notes, they tend to lose their grip after a short period, leading to frequent reapplication or, worse, notes falling off surfaces altogether. As a teacher, I intended to use these for assignments and classroom organization, but my students have taken a different approach. Rather than using them for their intended purpose, they've turned them into collectibles, insisting on having every color in their collection. This has resulted in a messy situation, with random pieces of sticky notes scattered across the classroom floor. To prevent further distraction, I've decided to hide these sets until next year, when I hope to use them more effectively for assignments. Until then, I'll stick to the reliable name-brand sticky notes for classroom use.

Colors are good, just as pictured but the paper quality and adhesive are lacking

These are decent little sticky pads, but a lot thinner than a standard Post-It pad and thinner paper. Fun to have dark colors and light colors. Each page is also pretty thin, but the self-stick is pretty good.

These 3x3 Sticky pads are the perfect size for to do list, reminders and to take along with you.  Great value for the quality and quantity.

I love the variety of colors and the quantity in this pack. I am always using sticky notes for something. There is no bleed through to the next sheet no matter what type of markers I use. The adhesive is okay. It definitely doesn’t stay on plastic surfaces. I have placed these on multiple types of plastic surfaces only to return a little while later with the notes all over the floor because they fell off. Works good on paper.

Granted, it's been years since we've used a "name brand" sticky note in our house, so we can only compare this to how they perform vs. other no-name / off-brand sticky notes. With that said, this has a nice assortment of colors, most of them light enough for regular pen to be seen (the darker blue and the purple are harder to see, but a bolder marker does the trick with those two colors).The stickiness is good as far as we can tell so far -- it does lose some of its magic if you peel up & re-stick more than a couple of times, although that's not something that we usually need to do. Generally, for our use, it's either a page marker in a book, a quick "reminder" note or instruction for someone, etc. -- it's not something that's going to need to stay up for a prolonged period, or moved around from place-to-place.Overall, this is a good value for a good assortment of colors and pads of sticky notes!

These are good notes for every day use.  I am using them for shopping lists and to do lists.The paper is rather thin and the adhesive isn't high quality.  If you are looking for notes to stick up somewhere long term, this might not be the product for you.  For me, I am using them for a day and then throwing them out, and they are sufficient for this purpose.  I also really like the colors.I appreciate that it comes with instruction on how to peel the notes to reduce the curl.  They still curl somewhat when you do it properly (peeling side to side), but it is less than if you do it incorrectly (bottom up).

I’m a little conflicted about these. These sticky notes are aesthetically pleasing and come at a great value ($4.99 at time of review). However, they are not super sticky. I had to constantly remove a note and noticed the more I moved it, the power of adhesive quality notably declined. The sticky notes suffice for basic tasks. If you're okay with sticking them once and leaving them, they're worth considering, especially for the price. I'd most likely order them again.

My sticky notes that came with 12 packs of 3x3" sticky notes with 6 pastel colors and 6 bright colors. Each pad has 80 sheets where the name brand usually has 100 but that same name brand is also more than double the price.The notes aren't super sticky but they hold well enough. The only thing I'm not crazy about is that the bright blue and purple may be difficult to see if you use anything other than a black marker.

These are well-made sticky notes with nice colors that are kinda different than your usual bright yellow. I prefer these colors. Sticky notes have a way of sticking out like a sore thumb. These don't. Yay! The only downside? Well the company sells the crazy bright sticky notes with 80 sheets per pad, whereas these only have 50. Sad. I mean, the dye to make these can't be more expensive. Or is it?

These notes are well packaged and attractive.  I'd personally prefer they skip the darker colors because it makes it hard to see the writing on the notes, but that's probably just a personal preference.  I do not think the sticking power is is great as the name brand, but these notes are less than a third of the price of the name brand! And just how long do we need a sticky note to stick?  I'd buy them again!

I got these for various temporary notes put on things. The colors are great and ten of them are more pastel so writing shows up well.Decent quality. A slight lump along the sticky side, and some faint darkening along it on some colors. Writing is smooth. Adhesive seems to initially hold as well as any sticky note. Legibility on the two darkest colors (blue and purple) was still decent.Testing how well they stick, I put two up, one on a cleaned surface, and they are still up 12 days later, just as well as initially.

These are great sticky notes and exactly as I would expect from a higher-end sticky notepad. If pulled off the pad correctly (from the side not the bottom up) these stick nicely to what they need to stick to without any leftover residue. They come in a bunch of different colors and are easy to write on. They are exactly what I need.

This product comes with many colors which is so fun!I use these while I’m at work, I’m a nurse, so these are super helpful for me throughout my day.My only complaint is that the adhesion is not that sticky. This really isn’t a problem because most of my sticky notes are underneath the stack of papers anyway. The colors are great, and they take ink really well. They don’t smear. They’re just great! -1 star for not being that sticky, even though it doesn’t bother me too much. I’d highly recommend these since they are so cute and colorful.

These sticky notes are very smooth and come in the whole range of colors from brights to pastels. For me, the price seemed reasonable. Most of the time, I use sticky notes for reminders to myself or to adhere to paper. However, as a user of a brand name of sticky notes, I am used to a much stickier backing. While these are sticky enough to adhere to paper or other non porous surfaces, I don't think they are as sticky as the brand name version, and I don't think they would stick as well to a surface like a painted wall, which is why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5.

This package of 3x3 sticky notes has a good variety of mostly pastel colors, which I prefer, and four brighter colors. They stick well and are easy to remove and re-stick. I do find they sometimes curl up on the ends after a while, for example, when I stick them on the edge of a computer monitor. It doesn’t happen when placed flat on a surface. Good value for the amount of notes and color variety in a package.

The description is accurate:  there are 12 pads, 3.3 inches, colorful, check, check, check.  I think it is important to note, however, that these pads were smaller than I expected.  Kudos to whoever took the product pictures making them look thicker than they are.  All sheets are there as described and they ARE vibrant variation of colors, but there aren't as many sheets per pad as the brand name.  I included a picture to indicate how thick the brand-name makes theirs and how thick these are.  Still, I think price will come out about even.  These are less expensive than the brand name.  The thickness doesn't feel as thick as the brand name, but that doesn't matter much as they are strong enough to get the job done.I do recommend these sticky-notes, just be aware they are not as thick as you might expect.

This set of sticky notes comprises of 12 pads in different colors, 80 sheets each. They’re thinner than the original ones made by 3M but they serve their purpose. Having the different colors comes in handy too.

There are only 50 sheets per pad for a total of 600 sheets.  The price listed at the time I wrote this review was about $10.Generic yellow pads usually cost about $10 for 2400 sheets.  So with these you are paying about 4 times as much to have a variety of colors.  However, the price is fair as compared to other color pad sets on the market - higher than some generic brands but about the same as name brands.The colors are pretty rich and the adhesion of the notes is good.  They also absorb ink well when you write on them.  So these are pretty decent quality sticky notes and eye-catching to boot.My overall impression is that this is a good product for a reasonable price and that people will generally be happy with their order.  You might be able to find better deals but this is a safe purchase, a good value for your money.

Decent quality paper. The adhesive works OK. Nothing out of this world, or fantastic. But they definitely don't suck, either. The variety of colors are a good thing.

Variety of colors match the photos. A bit thinner than I am used to. Stick decently well.

These notes  are not quite as good as post-its, but waaay better than some of the competition here on Amazon.  I have given highly critical reviews on other sticky notes brands in the past!The paper is thinner than a classic post-it, though I’m not seeing a downside to that right now.  The adhesive is not perfect (the sticky note will still curl up at the edge on a vertical wooden surface) but after 3 days the curl did not persist and the note held on!...and through multiple removals and reapplications, even on imperfect surfaces (a tiny bit dusty or not hermetically smooth).Please note that the color stacks are 1/2 the height of what you’d expect a short stack to normally be, so pay attention to the price per sheet.Overall the price is quite competitive with industry leaders and I feel that they are of good enough quality to recommend.As long as they remain cheaper than post-its, I would definitely buy these again.

These stick as expected; no problems there.However, not a lot of writing utensils work on these.  That's fairly normal for this type of material, but I still wish they could make these better.I do appreciate the included pen (lid easily fits on back when writing with it).The color selections is nice, both bold and light.

These sticky notes work fine on paper, but fell off a vertical non-porous surface (wood paneling) within 15 minutes.  These are fine if you are using them on paper substrates.

Great for the office, classroom or the college student.  Student use to tab in college books.  Teachers write good notes to students or great reminders can be posted.  The adhesive is good.  The 12 packs are wonderful.

I recently put together a huge lot of teacher goody bags for the holidays.  One thing that is almost always on their wish lists are post-it notes.  I get where teachers could chew through post-its!  In any case, I saw this nice 12 pack, and figured they'd be great additions to my bags.I do like all the colors you can get these things in now.  I remember when they were yellow and yellow only.  The size and adhesive on these was what you would expect.  I have no complaints at all!

These are the standard 3x3 inch sticky notes. The paper is a bit thinner than the name brand, but that doesn't seem to bother me. I've used numerous writing implements on the sticky notes and nothing seems to bleed through that easily. Kept a few notes up on my desk and a few days later they were still stuck there with no issues. They seem like an okay deal, could be a little cheaper. You get 12 pads so you get plenty of sheets though and a good variety of colors of the pads.

The black sticky notes are a novelty that made it easier for my students to know the note was from me.

As described

I go through a lot of post it notes at work. These are cheap and just as good if not better than the post it name. Better because they are more cost effective!!

I use lots of sticky notes in my home office and these are such fun colors!

Love the colors. Works well from what I need it for.

Perfect for back to school.

They work great and I loved the colors!

These are surprisingly better than I thought they would be. The colors are bright and they stick really well. They’re a bit thinner than the brand name, but I don’t use sticky notes for permanent notes!They’re handy and save me quite a bit of money.

What can you say about sticky notes? You can write on them, they stick, they work. Great colors.

Definitely love these sticky notes , ease of use and quality is good and the brightness of each color is amazing, as well as its stickiness

Today, if I were the person who thought of these useful notes when he was sitting in an office one day, cut a white sheet of paper and glued it to the top of a memo - I would be so proud others liked the idea as well as I.  I would be astounded at manufacturers and how they have developed wonderful colors, eyecatchers.  So - this is what we want our notes to be - eyecatchers - know these are just that - the "stickability" is marvelous.  I have just the place to showcase them in our little home office.

I use sticky notes for everything (particularlybecause I'm older and forgetful now) love the vibrant colors. Glue works well, keeps sticky note in place. I highly recommend.

Excellent

These are great quality sticky notes! I only have 7 pads left — and have already been through 5! I love the variety colors. And the stickiness is good — I sometimes add tape for reinforcement. Long lasting and a great price for the amount of sticky notes you receive.

These stacks are smaller than the post it version, but great quality and a lot for the money. Paper is thin.

Great variety of colors. Good quality!

Would buy again!

Arrived quickly and a nice assortment of colors!

I like these better then post it's. They really stick to what you need it to. They are easy to write on and I love the colors.

Colors are as expected.  Stick well on smooth surfaces (maybe not on wall).  No residue.  Well worth the money!  I paid about $4 and got 600 sheets in total, with pleasing colors.  A good deal!

Good for leaving notes. Cheaper than the brand name ones. Sticks well

It’s a sticky note what else can I say.

Just what I was looking for. Love the colors

Sticks well. Nice colors. Definitely worth the money.

love them so colorful

These sticky notes are as good as originals without the higher price.

Have them for the kitchen , work bag , and to do list. Great value!!

I bought these sticky notes to use in my office.  They work well, stick great and now I have so many colors to chose from.  Very satisfied with this purchase.

Got this for my daughters teacher and she said they work great.

Perfect for my needs, and better priced than name brand.

The product description mentions that this can be used as a journal, but it fails to explain that the word "Date:" is printed at the top of every page. I wanted an empty notebook with ruled lines, NOT a notebook that has pre-printing on every page. At six bucks, it's not worth the hassle of returning the stupid thing, besides which I had to tear off the shrink-wrap to see what the pages look like. Ruled notebooks should be described clearly in the Amazon product descriptions, but of course that's the responsibility of the manufacturer, not of Amazon.

This note book is so small..This is it next to an average size note book.It's cute but not worth $5-$7.I got that big note book at the 99 cent store for $4.

Pages are upside down

The book arrived with the pocket up-side-down as well as table of contents. I have to pull it apart and switch everything to put in working order

The table of contents was right but all the other pages are upside down

The inside had scribbles in it that were hidden behind a white sticker

Front and back covers have scratches and dents. Looks very beaten up.

Notebook was damaged! Hard to open!

Cheap vinyl cover, and super flimsy. Cheap paper and quality. Disappointing.

It’s nice it kind of does what it needs to do but every time I turn the page it doesn’t want to turn back on the coils so I kinda just end up turning the pages up so I wouldn’t get it again, but I would recommend they would do something with the coils wouldn’t keep catching on the paper and ripping them.

Paper writes nice with the right pen. Good size and spacing. Unfortunately, the paper tears because of the tightness of the spiral so it will be ugly before too long. Would not buy again. Just meh.

Beautiful color. As for the notebook, it’s not what I expected and is much smaller and thinner than I had thought. This may be my fault for not getting out a ruler and realizing how physically small this is. I thought I was rebuying my favorite daily notebook where I log all my work, but this was half the thickness and two inches less on each side than that one. I just wish my regular notebook came in this shade of pink; the color is the only thing I like about this notebook.

Mine came bent up, so it was ruined. I decided to keep it anyway though, bc I needed it.It's nothing great, elastic band is very loose. It's way overpriced.I would not recommend this to my friends.

This looks like something that would’ve came from the dollar tree. The hard cover was also bent and damaged when I received it. So I would say it’s great if you don’t mind spending $6 on a damaged notebook that is dollar tree quality, but if not, it’s not worth it. Won’t purchase again.

I own two of these now in both the black and green. I use them to take notes for bible study. They are very sturdy and the pages are nice. The cover is thick and the pages are easy to write on. I also like the spiral spine which makes it easier for note taking as well. There is a blank table of contents in the front, and blank date and page spaces on each page. I find the page and table of contents useful so I can record where certain things are. The green notebook is so beautiful. The price is also great for what you get. I would buy again and definitely recommend!

I am planning on using this as a journal and a record of where important papers are.  I liked this product so much more than I expected that I immediately ordered another.  Will probably order more - price is good and they are well made.  Will also make good Christmas gifts.

I've been wanting a smaller, easy to carry, lightweight, and attractive journal for my gratitude journaling practice. Larger journals have far more pages than I want in an annual journal and they don't lend themselves to personalization. This works so well for me I'm planning to purchase more for friends and for my own future use. The paper is a step up from typical binder paper, haven't noticed ink  bleeding, appreciate the versality, and love that the plain cover comes in many colors and allows me to personalize my journals. Affordability is a big plus for me and I like being able to store these in my bookcase.

Well made and a good deal.  I bought four.

Product as expected from photos and description. Works well for general note taking, but I wish the inside divider thing was removable so you could change where it is in the book.

This notebook is so much more than I expected to receive when I ordered it on sale. It has a lengthy table of contents in the front, a prompt so you can can leave your contact information, as well as a catalog of the brand's other paper products. There is a spot for the date and a place to custom number each and every page. This notebook also has a built in folder to hold loose papers so everything stays together.10/10 would recommend and will be buying more.

Cute and feels satisfying to write in. I like that the strap holds it close.

Love the sage green color and the journal itself is very sturdy and functional. I personally love the index section and there is ample writing room per page. Will be back to purchase more when I finish this one up.

I am in active breast cancer treatment and there are lots of things I'm supposed to do or remember  but "Chemo Brain" is a real thing.I used the table of contact pageant record my vitals twice daily; record what time I take my nausea & pain meds along with my daily maintenance meds; jot down symptom a to discuss on my next visit; jot down anytime I experience nausea, pain or any of the 1000 other side effects I could have.  I make notes when I speak with my doctors/nurses/social worker/therapist and life coach which are all provided by my insurance.I also make notes of support agencies I have applied to or spoke with.  I make notes on their requirements and what they can offer me.

I like that you can easily write both sides of the paper with the spiral siding. Paper is thick enough that ink doesn’t show through other side of paper (and I used black gel ink on it). Cover of the journal seems durable; I accidentally spilled some water on it the first night I got it and didn’t dry it off until the next morning. It didn't turn to mush or start peeling after—remained looking and feeling the same.I’ve only had it for several days now, but I like it so far.

Well made. Hard cover. No bleed through. Paper is pretty easy to write upon. Paper is somewhat thick.

I guess I thought it was thicker but I didn't realize the amount of pages would be in the book. The color is more of a blueish than a green. The paper quality is good and it does lay flat. It's definitely going to be useful for a journal and I really loved the price of it.

I use these for work to help keep track of the different projects I am working on. Does the trick for a good price!

This notebook will be used for notes from my BS class and messages

The book is good quality, feels sturdy. Fits in my bag perfectly. I like the fact there’s table of contents pages that was i’m not flipping through the entire book when i need to find something.

I'm currently using this as a prayer journal. Green is my favorite color and I was super excited when I saw the color green as an option. It arrived in great condition and on time. The pages are very sturdy and have a great amount of line space for folks with big handwriting. The cover of the book is super smooth and it comes with a strap holder to keep the book closed. My only suggestion is that it also comes with a bookmark. I did try to use the bookstrap as a bookmark and it made the book look like it wasn't completely closed.

The spacing is great and I like it has page numbers on the left hand column.  Be cartful the outside cover is very slick and could fall out of your hands

Lined Spiral Journal Notebook for Writing, 6" x 8" College Ruled Notebook with Pockets, Double-Wire Spiral Notebook for Work, School, Daily Life, Bible, Note Taking, 100 GSM Paper, 140 Pages - Forest.This notebook is marked Forest green but it's actually looks more like a light sage green. The notebook comes with an elastic band to hold it closed or mark the current page. Or use it to hold the clear storage pocket in place, as it is in the photo. The covers of the notebook are made from a very sturdy board, so they don't flex or bend -- which I really like. Several pages at the front form a built in index/Table of Contents, and the rest are blank pages with lines at the top for a date and at the bottom for a page number.I got this specifically because it said it was 100 gsm paper, and after receiving it I have to say that the pages feel a bit light for 100 gsm. They are definitely substantial, but not nearly as heavy as the 120 gsm paper I often use. I would say they are two times as thick as printer paper (whatever gsm that would be). I tested one of the pages with both a black ball point pen and a dark blue fountain pen, and both left shadow marks on the other side of the page. See photo with the Page blank. The line directly above the Page line is where I tested the pens on the reverse. See photos for details.

I like this 8" by 6 1/4"  notebook because of the following:1.  The pale pink covers are a very thick cardboard so I can write in the notebook without having to lean on a table or a desk.  I tote a small notebook along with me to jot down notes or ideas for later and having one that I can write in when I am holding it is appreciated.2.  The paper is a decent thickness - not the thickest but not thin.  I can write on both sides of the page with only minor show through if I'm pressing hard with a ballpoint pen.3.  There is a great 3 page (6 sides) Contents section in the beginning with a format that lets me add a page number and then a heading for what is on that page.  Note that the following pages are NOT numbered and I will have to number them as I go, but this contents section is going to be a great way to find what I'm looking for without having to page through the entire notebook.4.  The rest of the notebook is just lined pages with a spot up top for the date and a spot in the bottom for page number.  The pages lie flat thanks to the smooth double spiral binding.5.  There is a small clear plastic pocket mounted inside the back cover that will be handy to keep receipts or loose notes in place until they can be filed properly.6.  The thin elastic band is large enough to hold the notebook closed, but also thin enough to be unobtrusive when left around the back cover.Things I don't like:1.  There is no bookmark so finding the page where I left off could take a minute or two.  Guess I'll use a flag stuck to the page to mark this.2.  The notebook covers are only covered with a matte paper.  I tend to put my notebooks down on tables in cafes and end up having to wipe them off later.  I'm not sure how durable this matte paper will be in the long run.All in all, a very handy little book.

I recently purchased this journal, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! This pad includes everything I need to stay organized and productive at work.

it was very nice. the only thing i was upset about is that it got delayed. it look almost a whole other day to ship! it was disappointing but besides that its perfect. 10/10

completely usable and of sufficient quality for the cost. Paper is dyed a nice hue (not creamy but not super bleached out). Spiral seems tough enough to withstand being tossed in a purse but maybe not a schoolbag, at least a middle schoolers book bag. Glue on the cover seems iffy, but youre not paying moleskin prices so ... vellum pocket also a nice touch and that feels more sturdy. Totally good nuff.

The spiral is sound and looks as though it won't snag on clothing. The cover color looks almost grey and is subtle and fine for the office or classes, or just for organizing around the house. There is an elastic that either holds the notebook closed or can mark a page. I notice that this is no longer available. It was a reasonable value although if you just want a spiral notebook, the regular 8 x 11 size may be available at a better value from your local store. I look forward to using this though because it will easily fit in a purse or small backpack. It's small enough, it could work as a travel journal.

The pages feel a little thin to me so be careful with the type of pen you use. Otherwise it's a solid journal that can be used for various things.

Nice heavy duty journal. Great for devotionals. Lots of space. Texture of cover material is nice. Looks great.

The youth group from our church goes to summer camp every year, and this year I'm putting together "swag bags" for them. This journal will go in one of the bags. It's a nice journal and I like the fact that the pages are lined. The spiral binding means that you can open the journal and fold one side back for easier journaling and note-taking. The paper has a nice texture and is thick enough so that writing doesn't bleed through to the other side. The elastic band makes it easy to find where you left off, and the pockets inside for loose items are super handy. Overall, a nice little journal.

Really looking forward to gifting this for Mother's Day. Elastic band on  the side keeps everything together. , really easy to carry around and fits in most of my bags. The hardcover is thick and sturdy, and the spral binding hasnt yet poked out, so thats good.

This is a nice journal with a table of contents and pages you can number. It's a smaller size so you could throw this in your purse or brief case.

I use it to keep track of feelings, thoughts, things to do, places to go and notes. The quality is good and the weight of the paper is also just right for journaling.

I love the colors, and the sheets are nice and thick, will be buying more. Thank you.

Great quality note book, very light weight and with the size you can take it just about anywhere you go. The paper has good texture and works well for all types of pens, and pencil. Highly recommend.

I love this notebook because I can lay it flat with the spiral binder. Worth it for the price and useful since the pages have a date and page section to write in. Also has a contents page

The notebook is very sturdy. I really like the layout of the book. There’s a content page and each page has a section where you can number it yourself. There’s also a plastic folder in the back to keep extra notes or stickers.

The color is even cuter in person

I don’t have any opinion.

I loved the cover. And I  know, I will have this for a long time!

This student flute is made beautifully with quality sound and well priced..

Helps my organization. Handy with my psychology courses.

Wish it was sectional, but it’s OK

I really like the quality of the cover and the paper has a nice weight and feel to it. Would purchase again.

This notebook is a great organization tool. I love how the pages are listed with the date at the top to really keep myself organized at my new job.

I wanted a new journal and I really like the ringed notebook.

I love a notebook, and this is a sleek, simple journaling notebook.It's full of blank lined pages.

This Journal Notebook is versatile and perfect for everything from daily journaling to note-taking, sketching, or even planning. It’s become an essential part of my daily routine, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone who values quality and functionality in a journal.

I love this product It has alot of room. Bought this for work and now I use it at home.

I love how this notebook has a table of contents. You can easily find what you’re looking for after multiple meetings or note taking.  Super cute, great quality!

Lined Spiral Journal Notebook = Perfect size for work and travel.Bottom line = Helps get day and night tasks done

I love this little notebook.  I am keeping all kinds of random notes in there for 2025 so the 'Table of Contents' are great!  There is a little area at the bottom of each page where you can write in the page number. This is extremely helpful for keeping me organized. I have never seen a little notebook like this before so I am really happy I found it.  It works perfect for what I am using it for.

I am a bit of a paper snob. I did not expect that this journal would be such high-quality or that the paper would be of such a nice quality. This is an excellent journal.  I highly recommend it.

Nice. Feminine. Paper is quality.

Love the notebook, I want to use it as a journal book for travel !

Using it for my personal cook book and cooking notes.  Works great, heavy duty covers.

Love these notebooks

I'm a User Experience designer and I can say without hesitation that this is the most user-friendly journal I've ever owned.  As a chronic starter-but-not-user of journals, I can say that this one I am actually using on a daily basis.  The design is simple and seamless.  Love it.

It is sturdy.  I like that it lies flat when opened.

Super nice notebook. The pages are thick enough and it has a nice cover. 10/10!!

Nice journal book and as advertised.

Looks incredible. It's exactly what I need for my minutes at work and notes during meetings. Happy customer

The size is perfect and Fits easily in my purse that I carry daily. The paper is thick and higher quality than I expected and it is much better than other notebooks I have used that are similar to this size. I also love the spiral bound and the loop to keep it closed. Highly recommend and will purchase again!

Very well made for journaling.

No complaints on this & for the price it was a good buy.

I got this journal for myself because Green’s my favorite color and I love it. Plus, it feels soft.

Use it to journal and keep class notes. Nice size

I’m using this for Bible study note taking. Great quality. Will be buying more in the future.

i love the color and it has the option to add an index and place to write the date

Nice hard cover ; very nice product

I have bought this three times already. Helps me jot down notes for different topics. I like the little trap to hold the pages in places.

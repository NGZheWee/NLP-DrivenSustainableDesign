The liquid Castile soap you could use as a shampoo, body wash, hand soap at the sink, overall degreaser…we used it in the kitchen, around the stove and to clean the bathroom. And we would dilute it so a little went a long way. I believe a full bottle back then was about $7.50 (it’s now about $14)So I tried the bar soap…not impressed at all. Seemed to dry out my skin, I can’t imagine using this on my hair. Certainly can’t use it for much else than hand and body so it’s not versatile like the liquid soap.And the price! My bar lasted me for about 2 weeks of daily use and then when it got small, it broke apart into pieces too small to use.At full price, this is about a $6.50 bar of soap that will last 2 weeks of daily use.Dr. Bronner’s went from being the cheap alternative organic multi-use to severely overpriced hipster soap. Fortunately you can get a generic version of the liquid Castile soap for about $9.00 at Meijer that smells similar and works just as well. That bottle will last you for 5 months and it’ll work al through the house.

A friend of mine is a mechanic and I convinced him to try this because his hands were always black with dirt even when they were ""clean."" He was shocked that his hands could actually be CLEAN clean.I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works magically. If you used cream or liquid products and left them to sit for a bit, it would help to use a little bit of oil (olive or sweet almond oil are my recommendations) to break it down a bit before using soap. Follow up with a silicone free conditioner for your natural hair brushes to keep them properly conditioned because they are hair after all.I also highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with skin & heat rashes under skin folds or bra areas but use the unscented version. I work with unhoused and elderly people who struggle with this and medicine is not always covered by insurance.

No obnoxious fragrances! Doesn't dry out your skin! Cleans surprisingly better than most other soaps, and I'm mean for blue collar stuff like automotive grime. Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things. I hope this review helps sell a lot of soap. Enough to get my local grocer to carry it ;) Maybe even enough to drive the price down a little. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.

I used it again just to check if it was in fact the soap and not something else and as soon as I used it again the rash came back.

You feel clean and not filmy as with most soaps.Cons:* Price! You would think that a soap without the additives that drive up cost would be less expensive than its peppermint/wintergreen siblings.  However, not so.* Lasts no longer than other commercial soaps.  At this price you would hope that the bar would be denser or longer lasting, but (again) not so. I've had some milled french hotel bar soaps last longer than this bar did.Best uses:* Folks who have skin or allergy issues that are willing to pay a premium price for a soap with no additives.* Hunters who want to be scent-free in the woods.I'm happy with its performance, but its a niche product and not a good value.

I have the bar soap because I thought it would last longer & be easier to work with (for my specific needs) rather than the liquid soap; however, I would like to also try the liquid baby mild soap. I decided to purchase it to use on my 4 month old son. He has very dry skin & several rough, scaly patches (I believe it may be eczema but he hasn't been medically diagnosed yet) and I brought the soap in hopes that the Castile soap would help his skin retain moisture. At the time I was using Aveeno baby soap & lotion, and I felt that it may have been drying his skin out. So far I've been using dr. bronner's for about a month & and I've definitely noticed a difference in his skin. I've also changed the lotions I use on his skin. Along with using this soap to bathe my son, I also use this soap to scrub out poop stains before putting the clothes in the washer machine. I breast feed & my son has frequent (about 1-3 times per week) blow out diaper messes. When he has a blow out I hand-scrub his clothes in the sink, before putting them in the washer. Dr. Bronner's removes poop stains better than the baby dreft laundry detergent that I use !! It removes the stain phenomenally. And I've never noticed any damages to the color or quality of his clothes' fabric.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this soap for bathing, as well as a clothing stain remover.

After two of my latest piercings, my new piercer recommended Dr. Bronner’s and said don’t fall for the BS products like H2Ocean spray and I wish I listened to him. I’ve dealt with keloids galore but this soap (and only using this) has made the healing process super easy and FAST.

I kept running my hands over my arms because they felt so great.Even though this is an unscented soap, it does have what I would call a typical soap smell to it. It's not unpleasant, quite nice, and I assume the 'unscented' means they didn't add any scent to it, so you're just getting the natural smell of the ingredients. It makes no difference to me, but if you want a product that actually has no smell, this won't be it.The bar is lasting a good while compared to what I'm used to. It's a pretty hard bar, not soft like some of them that seem to wash half away the first time you use it.

My reason for a 3-Star rating is not because I consider this to be a poor product, but rather because I think it is promoted as a moisturizing, balancing skin cleansing option when it is not. This duly noted, plenty of people will use it and have no problem whatsoever - but this is the case with nearly any product we look at. In the case of liquid Castile soaps, these soaps perform the duty of cleansing in a very serious way. Any product that can effectively clean your floors, dishes, laundry, etc. and also doubles as a skin cleansing agent - may just turn out to be somewhat too harsh on skin. I love the fact that this soap is easily used as a base to carry lovely fragrances, and it is definitely affordable. However, for people who struggle with any dry skin concerns, this soap is far too detergent in nature to be used on a daily basis, and as a licensed esthetician, I advise against its use as a daily soap for body or face. If you do plan to use this for body, please do dilute. Full strength Castile soap is far too stripping for the skin. The skin is a living organ with a delicate pH balance and natural fats that are important to keeping it soft and supple. Cleansers that effectively remove ""everything"" remove all the ""good things"" too. Again, this is a great soap to play with, to make interesting concoctions with, and although many people swear by it, I have it to be far too drying and the source of patchy, itchy dry skin far too often.",0,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

I'd discovered Bronner's via a search on Amazon and remembered happy days about 50 years ago when I loved showering with the peppermint Bronner's!  I use unscented for my CPAP equipment.  And I apparently wrote that a few days ago before I wanted to use it!  (I have memory problems.) NEW INFO;  I don't remember if the bottle was shrink wrapped or what, but it wasn't spilling.  I put it in my bathroom and when I went to use it, discovered that the flip top had been torn off, and I didn't do it.  There's a hole in the screw on top lid to get the soap out, but no top of that lid to flip down over the hole.  Two problems w/ that.  Arthritis and I drop things. Soap spills when it's open.  Also,  If you don't put the ""lid"" down, the soap will congeal and stop up the hole out of which the soap is dispensed.  So I will be spending a lot of time with a pin and hot water trying to clear it.  I suspect that someone returned it???  After breaking off the lid that closes down over the hole?

One bottle of this will last you months. (Maybe weeks if you have an exceptionally large family of cleaning freaks).When I started down this path, I only used it for refilling my hand soap containers. I dilute it at about 10 parts water 1 part soap - it makes for a very liquidy soap, perfect for the foaming containers which I have since confiscated from friends who still *gasp* buy new things of soap when one goes empty. Before I had the fancy shmancy foaming pumps, I just used the normal soap pumps. It worked fine, but it was runny which took a bit of time to get used to.But because it is so diluted and still cleans very well, I had a crazy amount of soap on my hands. So I started using it to clean other stuff. Dish detergent was the next thing on the list - I dilute it maybe a touch less than the hand soap (maybe 8 parts water to 1 part soap) and it works equally as well as the name brand dish soap that I used to buy. Only a few times have I felt the need to let things soak a bit longer than I would have otherwise, but even then I tended to soak overnight, so no real change. If you're as crazy as I am, you can add some citrus essential oil to it to help with the degreasing aspects. Just 20 drops or so. It's not necessary though - just gives it a nice scent and I like to think it helps things along a bit. I probably do this about half the time.Still so much soap left and, well, I ran out of some all purpose spray. Made my own with a bit of Dr. Bronners to a 50/50 mix of water & vinegar. Works AMAZING. I now use Dr. Bronners for just about any cleaning that requires soap. If it's a tough job, I don't dilute it as much. If it's a light job, I dilute it a bit more. If it's something that won't be rinsed (all purpose spray), I dilute it significantly. (Tip on stuff that isn't going to be rinsed, use distilled water if you have really hard water. Otherwise you might feel a bit of film. I just boil some in my electric kettle and let it cool. Works fine.)Infinitely cheaper, over all, than the stuff you buy in the store. And, bonus: not as many chemicals. I'm not anti chemicals or store bought cleaners, but I've come to the conclusion that they don't work significantly better (if at all), they're more expensive, and they're not any more convenient. It takes all of a minute to fill an old spray/pump/squirt bottle with water, add some Bronners, maybe add some fragrance, and move on. One bottle to do almost all. Never going back.If you've never used Bronner's in this way, you can easily find loads of tips & suggestions on the Google. Lisa Bronner even has a blog and has posted a chart with dilution rates. And dilution isn't an exact science. You don't have to measure it all out. I just eyeball it.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The replacement soap cartridges for this dispenser are expensive (proprietary design) but there are a few YouTube Videos showing how to open these cartridges (running cover under very hot water and prying off with flat blade ""butter type"" knife) or you can refill using large basting syringe with brass tip fits into top of cartridge, just hold open silicon air release valve with toothpick careful not to pop into jar (if u do then u need to remove top with heat to retrieve and insert back into top otherwise will not function properly in dispenser) - anyway back to soap - I fill 10 oz jar w/ 1/3 Castile soap, 6 drops of vitamin ""E"" oil, 1 tablespoon of Almond oil, then use high quality essence scents - mix as u like (Lavender, Seet Orange, Rosemary, Tea Tree, etc.. some have natural germ killing properties) depending on essence I add 3 to 10 drops of each (2 to 3 scents mixed) - then fill the rest of the jar using DISTILLED water - approx. remaining 2/3 of the 10 oz capacity jar - then turn upside down, right-side up, several times until mixture is blended - you don't want to shake vigorously because you'll get too much foam inside jar, mix gently. I write down my ""formula"" on the jar with a sharpie because it is hidden under the Superhuman dispenser anyway and it reminds me what's inside the jar so if everyone likes it, I can repeat formula without having to memorize or look for a piece of paper somewhere. The sharpie washes off with some elbow grease and chemical cleaner if you want to change it later on.  This blend with the Almond and Vit ""E"" oils keeps skin smooth and soft especially for hands in harsh chemicals/detergents or greasy/dirty from yard work etc.. It cleans well, is gentle, and smells unbelievably good - you can alter scent essences for male or female preferred scents. Rosemary, Tea tree, and Orange or Lemongrass work well in ""Boys"" bathroom, while Lavender, Rosemary, is a good start for ""Girls"" - let the wife and kids pick their favorite scents - My Blend FOAMS Great with this Superhuman dispenser, some dispensers like less soap / more water, mine likes this 1/3 soap to 2/3 water ratio, I tried different ratios that didn't seem to foam properly (too loose or too firm) - Amazon sells everything needed- although local stores like ""Whole Foods"" have some all natural scents and oils for soap making as well. - I like the unscented Castile Soap because I like a blank slate - but you can get the pre-scented Castile and save $$$ and hassle of creating/blending  your own scents. - EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE.To fill cartridge using the syringe type baster (or if you pop top off instead) - the baster can also be used to clean the Simplehuman Dispenser using the included vinyl hose to connect to nipple inside the bottom of the dispenser, fill syringe with very hot tap water, turn dispense on and squeeze syringe to feed and flush out the dispenser as the internal plumbing does eventually get clogged and unit will not work correctly, and may not dispense foam (air venture gets clogged with soap) - just liquid soap - so this syringe has a dual purpose - it can be used to fill empty cartridges if u don't want to pop top off with very hot water to soften top - and it is perfect and fast to clean out internal plumbing, valves, venture etc.. - Operates like new after cleaning - about every 3rd refill - cleaning necessary. Here is link to syringe baster I use - from Amazon its only $8.89 (at present)-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFTYIMO/ref=sspa_dk_detail_5?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01HFTYIMO&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a54d13fc-b8a1-4ce8-b285-d77489a09cf6&pf_rd_r=NQ7837VHW3GX4J5TMAZY&pd_rd_wg=pQmPM&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&pd_rd_w=mhgJ0&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pd_rd_r=86e369e4-ab64-11e8-ab28-01ad97aa66bb",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I don't have to worry about scary chemicals or bad reactions on her sensitive skin. She is three-years-old now and she still uses this soap. I use it as a body wash for her skin and a shampoo for her hair. A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last you a long time. It's baby mild, which is why I have purchased this particular kind ever since she was a newborn. She doesn't cry when this gets in her eyes, but it still hurts; then again, water hurts her eyes, so I can't say if this hurts more than water. It has a faint smell, but nothing fancy or putrid. It just smells clean. When she was a baby, this soap allowed her yummy baby head-smell to shine through rather than masking it with that baby shampoo smell (which is a nice smell but not as nice as natural baby head smell). My daughter's hair still looks as healthy as baby hair and I always feel as if it's because of using this soap her entire life instead of damaging it with chemical shampoo. I have noticed how different her hair shine and texture looks compared to the other little girls in her church class. She also gets lots of compliments on how beautiful and healthy her hair is. Her hair is also silky soft.  I buy castile soap in place of my own body wash and shampoo, but I choose the black soap variety for me. This one is perfect for children and babies. This soap works up a decent lather but it's not like regular shampoo that lathers well because of chemicals. This is a large 32 oz bottle and that size will last for quite a while and can be distributed in smaller bottles if you prefer. I distribute this into a small squirt bottle that I keep in the shower so my shower rack isn't stuffed full. I use this big bottle as a refill.This soap can be used for more than body wash or shampoo. You can use it to clean your house, do dishes, laundry, and all sorts of things. If you look up the uses for castile soap, you'll be surprised. I have also used this soap to fill up the soap dispenser in my bathroom for hand-washing. This soap is runnier than regular hand soap, but it dispenses perfectly and is better for your hands than hand soap. Also, it's not as drying to your skin. It's totally worth the price.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

Luckily I probably croak before I run out of stuff to use. I bought this for an unconventional reason. I take iron supplements, and it turns my feces into iron. Not really, but hard as rocks. So I need to use an enema, they come out as little round rocks, instead of potato or small cucumber sized ones. Everyone online line said ""Castile Soap, use Castile Soap!"" in the enema. I bought this, and tried the ""Sudsy soap on the finger test"" inside me. No burning or irritation. So I added 5 drops to a gallon bag. No special effect, but not burning or anything.  I often get what i call ""tea"" out. It's brown, might have like tea grounds (Small chunks, goopy a little bit.), but doesn't move much. I upped it to 10 or 12 drops in a gallon. and it was dramatic. I got what I call ""chili"". Heavy, solid liquid that covers the entire bowl top. It dissolved everything. Which no other salt or chemical or enema solution did a damn thing. In fact multiple bowls. It does what people said it does. I tried it on my skin, it's supposed to be good on eczema, etc. It got the thick callous like spot near my elbows and knees off. All the excess skin. It's not as red, but the skin peels off in the shower with no scrubbing. I just rub it with my hands (Instead of scrubbing with a wet wash rag that reddens/irritates it.) and the excess skin peels away. Easy. I have blonde hair (Yes, from my mother, not a bottle!) and it gets frizzy and fly away constantly, and this works okay as a shampoo too for a couple of uses a week. The only thing I dislike is trying to get it out of that huge 32 oz bottle and it's cap. I bought a 8 ounce (300 Ml) oil and soap dispenser bottle here, I'll just pour it in, it has a flip top cap. i am not a big ""All Natural Ingredients"" person, but this seems to work as advertised. Just the enema use it is worth it too me. The eczema spots are a great bonus, we'll see how it's use as shampoo works out. I usually get two results. Oily and stringy, laid down flat, or stat-icky, fly away like ""Doc"" from the ""Back to the Future"" movies. My face tends towards oily, and it seems to remove and dry that up.

For the laundry detergent I do mix it with washing soda, so I can't attest to how it does by itself. I do use it, however, for treating stains on my laundry, and I am always very impressed with it; I just have to make sure that I soak the stain as soon as possible. I did try out Branch Basics to evaluate the difference between it and Dr. Bronner's, and I just feel like Dr. Bronner's is such a better deal. To me, it seems far more concentrated, and it is sold at a much lower price.

I used apple cider vinegar and it complemented the soap nicely (the vinegar smell doesn't stay).

Just enough to wash the dirt out of your skin.No added fragrance.This ultra high concentrate is quite economical. I use hardly 8 drops (yeah drops) for my son who is 5 years old. This one is going to last quite a while. While this product can be used as a hair care product as well, some of us may not like it's hair cleansing powers or the lack of it.

To be fair, it’s not all bad. It’s got great adhesion and is nice and wide, which is nice if you have aN unsteady painting hand or are trying to protect your ceiling or floors. My biggest gripe with this tape is in the removal. This tape has a hard time staying in one piece. You could be following it cm by cm as you remove it, and you’ll still get a random tear somewhere along the way. And not always big tears that are easy to remove: I’m talking those small tears you either have to ignore or pull out the tweezers to try to pry away. It’s incredibly frustrating and caused a lot of unnecessary extra work at the end of an already work-intensive project.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The same thing happened when I tried again with even less coffee coffee filtered even more slowly at even lower temperatures - the issue was clearly with the strength of the bag. The only way was able to keep to keep the coffee from splitting at creating a huge mess is by double filtering, which meant that the bags were used up twice as quickly.

I buy them when I can as I like that they are all unbleached and chlorine free.The #4 coffee filters work fine in a typical brew system or in use with a pour over style. I had used it in the latter and found that if I pressed the filter with my hand to squeeze out the last of the liquid from the coffee grounds, that it could tear along the seam. I don't think most people would encounter this as most people would use this for coffee to drip into using a machine. But just keep it in mind if you have a need to hand pour hot water over ground coffee- just let gravity do its job, and don't bother to help it along by squeezing out the rest.It is compostable! After you make your coffee, toss it all into your compost pile!They seem to make their products with care. Whenever possible I select one of their products over the typical beached or plastic laden product.

After cleaning my trim thoroughly, drying, and taping the entire bedroom's trim, I stood back to proudly look at my hours of work.  To my dismay, the tape was peeling up from the top of the trim.  I thought I missed some spots or didn't push it hard enough, so I went back and started pressing it down again.  Halfway through the room, I looked back, and within 10 minutes time, it was peeling again.  I was so mad.  I decided to try the green tape, and low and behold, it stayed.  Checked it again in the morning, and it was still okay.  Wasted $9 and hours of work.  Please save yourself the disappointment and go with the green.  Am returning the other 4 rolls that I bought.

It sticks well but removes very easily and cleanly when the masterpiece (or very much not in my case) is completed, so there's a nice clean edge to the painting and no buckling of the paper, since it's been stretched by the tape.My one criticism, and the reason for removing a star, is that often the tape doesn't tear cleanly across.  Admittedly I use my teeth to tear it, since using scissors or a knife would require a third hand, but I'm sure I'm not alone in this.

But the hepa filters (3) was a bit too snug of a fit and I had to struggle a bit to install them.  I noticed the pre-filters were not as thick as the originals that came with the machine. The original hepa filters fit and removed easily, so that may have been a give away as to quality.  Once the filters were in place, I turned on the machine and I heard a strange high pitch sound and also detected a faint but sickening smell.  I removed the 3 hepa filters and pre-filter immediately.  What could be the problem?

Hammond,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024",2,"I purchased two of these filter sets for my two Honeywell HPA300 air purifiers. After a month of continuous use on the ""General Clean"" Setting, both air purifiers started to emit a smell that, to me, was reminiscent of burning plastic or a failing motor. I assumed my air purifier motors were going bad, but I also considered it to be strange that both air purifier motors were going bad at the same time (one of the air purifiers is much older than the other). So, as a test, I ordered Honeywell’s HEPA Air Purifier Filter Kit to try with one of the air purifiers. I installed the Honeywell filters, and after turning on the air purifier, I immediately noticed that the burning plastic/failing motor smell was gone. After one week of continuous use, the air purifier was still working great (producing clean air with no smell). So, I ordered a second Honeywell’s HEPA Air Purifier Filter Kit to install in my second air purifier. After installation, I noticed the same thing: the plastic burning/failing motor smell was gone. I have now been running both air purifiers on the general clean setting for a while (one three days, one 10 ten days) and they are both working great. I am submitting this review to help others save some money and not make the same mistake that I made.Update March 8, 2024: Customer Service reached out to me and offered me a full refund.

They do come folded in fourths, so installation is a bit of a challenge due to the deep creases.  (It was easier to keep in place under the clips if the crease is on top.)  I tried to install the 3 main filters yesterday, but immediately noticed a heavy chemical smell upon removing each filter from the plastic bags.  After installation and turning the unit on, the smell was quite noticeable.  I took the filters outside and let them ""air out"" for several hours and then placed them in the garage overnight.  I just reinstalled them, and noticed the smell again upon turning the machine on.  I ran the turbo mode for several minutes, and the smell has now lessened, but still remains.  I do not know why they have an order.  I will try placing them outside again today for an additional ""airing"".  Is it the filter itself or from the plastic bag it came in?

These fit my LEVOIT Air Purifiers.It also happens they are a near perfect fit for the rectangle opening for the outside intake air of my AC closet. I placed the two side by side and they were about 3/4 of an inch narrow. So I cut 3/4 inch shim to take up the space. My vent provides oxygenated air, but also pollen and other smutz. I have two water proof 12v fans on a timer. Previously, I was using single layer register filters that are little better than a paper towel. These LV-H128 three stage charcoal activated filters are a big improvement. Already, the air from the registers smells cleaner. When the door for the closet starts help latch itself, it's time to change the filter.Along with my LEVOIT Air Purifiers in my bedroom and office, I hope my dusting/vacuum chores will lighten.

I ordered 2 of the 16"" sets for both sides of our sink, 1 30"" set for the over the toilet and a 36"" set for over the tub. Upon receiving them, I was surprised at how well packed they were. I did think the 36"" shelves were damaged by the damage on the vox, but they engineered the packaging nicely to prevent damage to the product.Onto my one and only victim, the 16"" set. The moment I removed the cellophane,  I knew it was incredibly cheaply made. So cheap in fact that I didn't even want to continue. But onward I went. I wanted to see what was inside these holes so I got my trusted scope to see how hollow this thing really is. It's nothing more than a corrugated box that they finished on the outside!Looking at the bracket, once you fought to get it out, you can see that the 1/16"" thick (if that) material would collapse if the slightest indent would form.On the 36"" model the bracket is 18"" long. I don't know how they knew the builders of my home, but somehow they managed to make the centers between the holes 15""! EXACTLY WHAT MY BUILDERS PROBABLY DID! No kidding. What were they thinking? Why did they not even bother to try and get at least one hole from both inserts to be 16"" on center? Okay, I get it. Some walls are 24"" But still, really?? The other thing is, this shelf is nearly 4 1/2lbs. If the limit is 25lbs and they say you can put towels, jars, plants, etc on this thing, sorry, this thing is coming down, QUICKLY! There's this thing called stress, fatigue, and oh right, forgetfulness.  One day one of these these things will kick in and kaRash!These are the times I'm glad I own a sealing machine. Out to the garage I go to vacuum seal it up and return all these sets immediately!

Brackets that you slide the shelves into are not straight on both shelves, they're angled up. Seems to be an issue with this product. Amazing that numerous reviews say this, but the company doesn't address the issue. Must mean they don't care, that instead of fixing their process, they prefer to send a new set of brackets/shelves when the problem occurs. That means they don't care about the consumer.UPDATE: now that I have 20 holes drilled into my wall, I'm sort of committed to using this product. I ordered a replacement and they too are not level. The brackets are angled up. This is incredible honestly. I now ordered a 3RD SET (20 holes in my wall), but if this doesn't work out I'll need to find a new path.

They are also in a very thin plastic wrap that makes them flop around so they are harder to store upright without wedging them between something.In comparison, these are pre-folded and come in a cardboard box that makes them much more manageable, with a lid to help keep ants and etc out of them.I never could find official Chemex filters for a reasonable price, I get the impression they are much thicker and provide a cleaner cup of coffee than these filters, so if your after something to give you Chemex-grade filtering these probably won't fit your needs. These are almost identical in thickness and texture to my cone filters for smaller pour-over systems, just lager so they can fit a Chemex. If your not a fan of Chemex's signature taste and want something more typical though, these should be fine for that. I always rinse my filters, and didnt taste anything unusual in my coffee compared to my other filters.Personally, the form factor and the box make these a good product for -me- and I'm happy with them, though the price is a little high for only 50 filters at about $7.99.

Typically, these chemicals get reused.  Sometimes, as they age, the begin to develop crystallization or other impurities.  These impurities can have a negative effect on the process you might be using, so they need to be filtered out.  I've found that the best way to filter most of these chemicals is with coffee filters.The problem with a lot of coffee filters is that they are 1) too small, or 2) not strong enough.  These Bake Choice filters are large enough to fit even my largest funnel.  They are prefolded, so it is relatively easy to get them inside of the funnel.  They are nice and strong, doing a good job with filtration and then not falling apart when I remove them from the funnel to drop them in the trash.  I see no reason why they wouldn't work just as well as for their intended purpose -- making pourover coffee.",0,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

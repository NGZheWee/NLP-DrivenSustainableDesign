It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",-2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

However, every day is more painful than the previous day!The lumbar is weak and useless. I can't feel anything in my back. The armrests are moving easily, so I should adjust them every time that I sit or move the chair. The edge of the chair is really uncomfortable and it has hurt my thighs and makes it painful in a way that it wakes me up during the night.

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

The ""tightness"" of it's adjustable parts clearly old, and the base it scratched up.  Also the box looked warn and everything about it feels like I got porked into paying for a new item but received a clearly used and worn one.  The problem is I need this now and don't have 2 weeks to wait for another one.  First time I've ever had to submit a negative review of something I purchased on Amazon.  And it's too bad Ergotron has to get a low review from a customer because of Ingram's poor service. I would imaging that this LX Arm would be nice if it didn't seem like it was used for the last year.  It doesn't seem tight and the adjustments don't hold the secondary pivot arm in place that well.

BUT... I was disappointed that they sent open box, previously installed product. If I'm paying a premium price for an arm this shouldn't be. It installed ok and it will hopefully have no issues. I need it now or I would send it back without hesitation. To begin with, none of the main arm parts were sleeved. I assume it comes that way because an empty sleeves had been tossed back in the box, but no one bothered to re-sleeve anything. The hardware pouch had been opened in 3 places (Poked finger holes. So tacky!). Both Allen wrenches were missing. I have a butt-load of tools so I was able to find the right wrenches but many people might not.  One of the arm finishing caps was loose and rolling around in the box (had been taken out of the pouch). Adjusting screws for one of the joints and the front tension had been tightened all the way in. The screw head on the tensioning screw showed metal filings and heavy scratches indicating it had been worked quite a lot with a wrench. The instructions were crumpled and obviously used. Not a big deal but again, it all felt like getting used product and I'm left wondering what other paper work might have been missing. I'm holding my breath there are no other issues with it. Its seems to be working fine for now but still wondering why it was sent back which I assume is the case. Check out what you get carefully. I recommend sending it back if its been opened and you can spare the wasted time. This should have been inspected and sold as refurbished product with a new hardware pouch tossed in at the very least. My review may be an anomaly.

If you aren't, ignore the following.If you want to save 40 dollars, and improve upon what you bought, go to the hardware store, buy a 1"" schedule 80 pre threaded aluminum tube, and please buy aluminum the base is also cast aluminum and if you cheap out and buy cast iron, you will have serious problems with the base and tube welding itself together and destroying whatever paint or coating you use to finish your new tube.  And yes, you need schedule 80 tubing if you're making it longer.  Take apart your stand, its 3 screws holding on a plate that hides the threaded portion of the stand, and remove 3 more insert screws around the circumference of the base.  From there you should be able to easily unscrew the tube, though if you have trouble, use a bit of heat and can easily remove your old tube.From here on, cut your new tube arm to your desired length, file the sharp edges, paint it black, take your old tube cap off, pop it on the new one, and reassemble.  At most you're spending 5 dollars on aluminum tubing, and 5 more on a pipe cutter if you don't have one or a saw.  The tube itself should take well to any kind of paint, or you can just leave it unpainted because aluminum doesn't rust for that hip industrial look.The rest of the arm itself is really well built, if annoying to adjust as it has a very limited range of motion, and the process of finely tuning exactly where the dials need to sit so you can actually move the arms, is unfathomably narrow.  Too much and you're fighting the arm to move it up, too little and your monitor is dragging the arm down.  After messing around with it for far too long, I took it apart, degreased and regreased all the parts, and it adjusted a lot better.That being said, while the build quality is pretty outstanding, its got too many problems to recommend in the slightest.You get what you pay for, but that's it unfortunately.  With a bit of work, you could make it absolutely exceptional.  But to pay an extra 40 dollars for a longer tube is absurd, and an extra 10 on that for white paint, is worse.  Just spend the 200 dollars and get something better, with a wider, more easily done degree of adjustment.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 1, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The two arms move well and can be steered without requiring great effort.The Cons: Assembly Instructions are minimal. The tilt and swing joints just before the monitor (circled in red in the picture), are too stiff and with too much stick, even after adjusting tilt to least tension. The swing joint is not adjustable at all. The stiffness of those joints makes fine tuning the monitor position difficult.My monitor is a Dell 27"", 9.7lbs (no stand). That's within the capacity range of the Ergotron LX arm (capacity: 7-25 lbs.) but near the low end of the range.Compared to my other monitor arm (Fully Jarvis), I  was disappointed in the Ergotron LX. It was more expensive and highly rated, but did not work as well with my monitor. Overall, it failed to meet my expectations. It may be better suited for heavier monitors. I will try it for a week and see what else can be done, but might send it back.Postscript: I re-read the reviews and it seems other people have experienced the same issues. I decided to return the arm.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Gamut,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2012",4.0,"I really like the quality of these Ergotron arms. They are less expensive than those by Humanscale, they offer more add-on options, and they look great. The packaging was perfect and they provide enough hardware to bolt-mount or clamp the arms, even providing extra screws. The instructions were above average compared to what we usually get with hardware and other equipment these days.I am giving these four instead of five only because they are still not tall enough, even being the tall version of these poles. I have a console desk (you know, the ones that have a monitor riser built-in) and I used these to expand it to accommodate both standing and sitting work situations. The height of the console desk is a standard 40 inches and these arms/posts are just three inches shy of putting the monitors where a six-foot person needs them to be when standing and with the arms extended to maximum height, positioned at the top of the poles, and with all four mounting points bolted. I wound up inserting an inch-thick board on top of the surface where the clamp attaches (the surface is glass anyhow, bottom of the clamp gripping the metal chassis) and I bolted the top edge of the mounting bracket to the bottom two holes on the monitors as a quick fix. This works for now when I adjust the height from the arm and *not* the monitor, but I am still going to need to add some more metal reinforcement so that someone unaware of this doesn't break the monitor's plastic backing. I am not comfortable with only two of the four mount points being used anyhow. I also wish that the clamp could have been extended an additional inch but I doubt that Ergotron's engineers predicted that their monitor arms would be used for this type of solution. (hey guys, if you're reading this, here is a cool way to use your product and you're oh-so-close to being ready for this, out of the box!)Although I could have just gotten a single arm with the dual-monitor version, I got two of these to mount each of my two monitors independently and from the opposing left and right edges of my desktop.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Fit and finish are excellent and adjustments are smooth and easy. It's well designed and looks professional and classy, with real metal accents that appear to be brushed stainless steel. The materials used are top notch. All of the structural components are made of steel. These days, it's great to find a product that doesn't use plastic just to cut costs, even on stress-bearing parts that should  be made of metal. The only plastic parts I spotted are the end cap of the vertical base tube and cable management fitting. The manufacturer clearly cared more about quality than cutting corners. Mine had some light scratches on the brushed stainless steel parts, which aren't noticeable unless looking closely. I don't know if it was a return or if they're all like that.What I like best about this mount is the wide range of adjustment it allows. I have it mounted on the rear edge of my desk and can bring the monitor forward enough so that I can kick back in my chair with feet on the desk and still have it at a comfortable viewing distance. The height is adjustable enough so that I can rotate my 27"" widescreen to portrait mode, not that I plan to do so on a regular basis. Any monitor larger than 27"" would not work in portrait mode with this mount due to insufficient clearance at maximum height. The mounting hardware permits it to be mounted on desks of varying thicknesses and there's also a fitting to allow mounting using a small hole in the desktop.Pretty much all of the benefits mentioned in the product description are accurate and not exaggerated. This mount has helped reduce neck and shoulder pain, eye strain and probably back pain, since I no longer have to adjust my posture to suit the monitor's position or struggle to read on a screen that's too far back. I also bought the
332B Notebook/Laptop Extension Stand Desktop Clamp
for my laptop, together with the Ergotron. With these mounts, I've reclaimed quite a bit of desktop space, making it easier to stay organized.This mount is a good value and well worth the price. It's built to last and will improve workspace comfort for many years to come.

I'm surprised that some of the earlier reviews are saying it's not worth the $400 they paid for it.  I WISH I would have paid $400 for the chair in this age of inflation, but at about $570 that I paid it's still a good deal given that new Steelcase chairs in this model run from $1100 t0 $1300+.  The re-manufacturing appears at this time to be first rate.  The back and pad are made well, although the seat foam does compress a bit more than I thought it would.  May need to supplement that for long haul work sessions.  Also the arm rest tops are a bit on the loose side, but not a deal breaker.  Also, it could have been lubricated better, especially around the reclining hardware which is chattering due to a need for lubricant.  I noticed the vid presented by Crandall shows an employee using WD-40 to lubricate.  While you should be careful of over spray by blocking off the area to be lubricated with a rag, and only spray very small amounts at a time, White Lithium grease is far superior to WD-40, which will wear off quickly. Lubricate the wear/friction points BEFORE assembly to make it easier on yourself.  The other point relates to insertion of the gas cylinder.  The instructions can easily be mis-read that you need to have a base insert for your cylinder if you don't catch the ""IF your chair comes with..."". As a note, the Leap V2 does not require the sleeve.  All in all a good deal, will adjust the review accordingly as time passes.Edit#1: I'm docking a star now that I've had time to use it.  The seat padding is definitely NOT up to Steelcase standards, but not terrible. While Crandall says they put a thicker pad on that Steelcase, it's a lesson that quantity doesn't always add up to quality.  The Steelcase foam has a different consistency to it, more along the line of latex which has much better support to compression ratio over time. It's good for around 6 hours before you need to get up and walk around a bit. I supplemented mine with a mesh pad. Also, I'm at a loss how the recline feature still chatters at certain positions. I can't tell where it's happening in order to apply lubricant.  Still, the chair is made well, but the padding piece is disappointing. Not enough to warrant a return though.  The other piece is the armrest, they are hard.  I needed to add some padding to those as well.  I'm sure the frame and mechanisms of the chair will make it worth the price compared to the fly-by-night import company versions.  Just wish they would have worked to get a closer match to the Steelcase foam as opposed to throwing more of a less dense type at it.Edit #2: I'm dropping my review an additional star.  It's been 7 months since I've owned this chair. I work from home and am in IT so the chair gets used a lot.  The seat foam used by Crandall has gotten worse with time.  Sure it gets used a lot, but what office chair doesn't?  I'm not a huge man, about 6', 180lbs, so on the up side of average. The foam is obviously suffering from compression damage, in that the cells are breaking with use, so the foam doesn't have its previous resiliancy (which was lacking to begin with). Also, I'm still living with the noise when sitting back.  I begin to question if this chair was worth what I paid, when not I'm almost hoping that the frame fails so I have a good reason to find another chair.  It is very disappointing considering how much I paid for it. As you can see the pad does become a deal breaker with the passage of time.Edit#3: It's been almost 2 years now and the breakdown of the foam in the seat continues to the point that the chair has become unusable without a supplemental pad.  I'm using a pad made from Dunlop Latex which is closer to the resilience of a true Steelcase chair pad.  I'm sorely disappointed in this company, they must have known they were using cheap foam due to their overt marketing about the ""extra thick seat foam"".  One of those psych the customer out strategies to make us think the thing was actually comfortable.  Not sure if I've got any recourse as I believe 12 year warranty conveniently only covers the frame.  So, hats off to their business model strategy: Get tough as nails used chair frames from Steelcase, clean them, touch up the finish, then throw the cheapest foam you can get on the seat and don't cover it under the warranty.  Well played sirs, well played and we've all been played.",1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": -1, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I did *a lot* of research, watching reviews, reading reddit opinions and the consensus was A) gaming chairs are all crap and B) the Steelcase Leap v2 is the best you can get. However brand new they are very expensive ($1500-$2k) but after reading more reviews, I kept seeing Crandall pop up again and again as a good place to get a used Leap V2Now you can can get a used leap V2 cheaper elsewhere, however the reason its worth it to spend $600 at Crandall is their warranty guarantee (12 years) and the amount of work they put into refurbishing the chair. Everything from deep cleaning, new casters, new (thicker!) seat pad, etc the chair looks like it just came off the factory floor. Putting the chair together was super easy, their instructions are very detailed (see picture), you will not see poorly-explained Ikea-esq diagrams here! They also have a customer support hotline.As for comfort, others have explained better than me, but the amount of adjustability options this chair has are amazing. Once I had everything set up, I can sit in this thing for hours and not have any back issues or discomfort. I expect this chair will last me a long, long time and highly recommend!",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 1, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It is nearly indistinguishable from new, except the style of fabric is slightly different. There is one tiny spot of surface rust on the bottom of the seat pan, and several of the screws have very light surface rust as well. But those screws are recessed into small cylinders that are also on the seat pan. In other words, no one is ever going to see any of this. You would have to turn the chair upside down and then the imperfections are so small that you'd have to be looking for them.I bought this because I have for years had lower back pain. I'm now going to PT and seeing a couple of different doctors, and I thought I might as well get a chair that is designed to support my back. It may sound odd, but my back actually feels better after sitting in this chair than at just about any other time. This is beneficial because I know I have to get up and move a couple of times every hour and this chair makes that easy to do. I used to dread getting up to stretch and walk because my back hurt so bad when I stood up -- so I avoided it and delayed it as much as possible. Now, though, I don't worry about encountering pain when I get up, so it becomes much easier to leave my chair to exercise.All in all, I am completely happy. This is one of those times when I really wonder why anyone would spend so much more for a new chair when they can buy this one at half the price -- or even a bit less. Well, I'm glad people *do* buy the new ones because then we can buy them after they have been reconditioned.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I thought about buying a new one, but I didn’t really want to spend all that money again on a chair. Luckily, I found Crandall Office Furniture and was able to buy an older re-manufactured chair with brand new seat pad and back cushion. I bought it with a platinum base and their steel bionet fabric, which I highly recommend if want a lighter grey chair with black accents.When I opened the box I noticed how clean and excellent the overall condition of the chair was. Initially the chair had a slight squeak towards the back and I was able to fix that with a bit of WD-40. The whole process of setting the chair up was straight forward, my only problem came when I tried to install the side activated gas cylinder. I was off just a tiny bit when I first placed it on and this led to the chair sinking when I sat in it. I was able to borrow a monkey wrench to dislodge the cylinder without damaging it and when I went to reinstall the cylinder a second time, I was more careful to properly line the clip up and lock it into place. (Crandall has videos on both how to install their cylinders and how to fix squeaks on YouTube so these are things anyone can do easily.)The biggest difference I have noticed so far between the Crandall Office Furniture re-manufactured Leap V2 and the original Steelcase Leap V2 is most definitely the cushion. The original Steelcase Leap V2 is more ergonomic out of the box. While this is good thing because it forces you to sit properly, it also means the chair seat is harder, and the overall feel of the chair is more rigid when you sit in it. The Crandall Office re-manufactured version of Leap V2 feels much more accommodating to my tushy and the lumbar support has to be raised along with the added cushioning the seat pad provides. I think overtime the chair will break-in and feel more ergonomic like the original Steelcase Leap V2.I am very happy with my purchase. I hope to buy one soon for my brother as well and have recommended this chair to several people. Here’s a funny little story: When checking the chair out for himself my dad asked me, “How much did it cost?” and when I told him he replied, “I don’t see how you can come out on that.” Then he sat in the chair and said he understood why I spent so much money on it.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

J. Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024",2.0,"As of writing this, I've had this chair for over 60 days and have sat in it for many, many hours over that time.Before getting into it, I should note that I don't have much experience with actually nice office chairs as I've only ever personally owned the cheapy $100 chairs you can get at Office Depot and the like, so consider that I'm an office chair layman as you read this.I'm 5'10/230lbs and this chair's pretty much perfect for me. I don't have any particular physical issues so I can't speak to how this chair would do for people with any specific conditions, but the ergonomics and comfort of this chair are such that I can sit in it for hours without needing to get up, and once I do, neither my back, butt, nor legs hurt. It has good lumbar support, a fairly soft yet supportive cushion that doesn't sink into the base even after sitting in it for 6-8 hours at a time, and surprisingly adjustable armrests. It's well-built, sturdy, actually feels like it's made to last which is nice for a modern American-made product, and looks good to boot. It came fully assembled which I didn't expect and thought was awesome, but also a bit of a pain for me since I picked it up from my local UPS Store where I have a box (can't get deliveries to where I live) and my car isn't exactly the most spacious, but I managed (I should've read the description beforehand). It did have a pretty strong chemical smell for about a week after getting it. The chair went on sale right after I ordered it so I contacted Haworth customer support and they retroactively refunded me the difference without any fuss at all, which I thought was great. Overall, very pleased with the chair, and I think it's worth it even at its MSRP.I'd also like to note that before buying this, I had purchased a Branch Daily Chair without realizing that I was right at its weight limit and my butt suffered through true agony for about a month before I even thought to check on those technical details (I thought maybe my body was finally telling me I sit too much, but nope, just too fat for that chair). Again, I really need to get better about fully reading through item descriptions, ha. Hopefully that's helpful to anyone around my size wanting to save some cash by going with that chair.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

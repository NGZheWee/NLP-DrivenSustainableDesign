OMG! I don't see how this could possibly have a 4.7 star rating considering what a poor quality product it is, the original tape that I had ordered in past was a generic no name tape unfortunately it was out of stock so I purchased this because it had such a great reviews only to find out that it doesn't stick trying to trim out molding and door frames and it is not sticking a very disappointing purchase and I bought three rolls.

The worst!!  Oh my goodness!I grew up using my dad’s blue painter tape he kept in the garage, and it never failed me.This crap pulled the paint off the wall after I gently pulled it off.  I was shocked and thought it was a fluke .My husband used it on a different wall a few days later and the same thing happened.What a bummer.  Not sure where my dad got his but apparently it wasn’t this brand.

I have completed a variety of painting projects with this tape inside of my home, and it does not release cleanly... ever.  I have used it to protect walls that were painted years ago (previous owner), as well as walls that were freshly painted (within the last week) by myself, and walls that I have painted within the last 6-7 months that had plenty of time to cure.  Half the time, or more, when removing the tape, it peels up the paint from the wall it was sticking to, forcing me to do a touchup.  (Ceiling paint, very high end wall paints, mid-grade paints, it doesn't matter, it ruins them all).  I am very careful when reming the tape as well, I follow the recommended methods, I don't rush.  I do not have this issue with other products I have used.Additionally, it does not create a protective barrier, many times when painting an edge (where an accent wall meets its neighbor, or, wall meets the ceiling), despite the tape making a strong adhesion, there is always bleed after the tape is removed.  Which is very frustrating.  It does not seem to matter if you remove the tape while the paint is still wet, or, wait for it to dry completely.I wish I could say it was my skills, but, I have not had these results with other brands.Perhaps a defective batch, but, I have used 2 x 4ea packs now.

ALERT! AWFUL MATERIAL, Impossible to work with, do not Buy this unless you want to redo the work more than 3-4 times, until you give up and get another brand from a local store, Save time and money, Do not Buy this (It arrive well package, everything looks good Until we use them, doesn't work to paint) becare full on buying the wrong tape, it will mess your expensive paint.

I used 2 different tapes for a project painting the ceiling trim. This tape is the worst, when I removed the tape it took much of my ceiling paint with it. The frogtape  worked perfectly and I regret not using it for the entire job.

I bought this to use as general masking tape for walls, car waxing.. etc. It doesn't stick very well to the wall and comes up in several areas. Your results may vary, but for my use the stuff isn't sticky enough

Bad tape with a long line of blue tape mark on my wall. I spent hours to scratch and remove the blue line. The tape is also very sticky to pull my original paint off. Worse paint tape ever!

Definitely not a clean release. This tape stuck to the paint and tore a good amount of paint off my walls upon removal. Don't purchase

I am spending some of my precious time on earth to tell you, do not buy this damn tape!!Need a longer piece? Good luck, if it folds and sticks to itself, there's no saving that part, it's just done for - I think I lost a quarter of the roll this way.Clean release? Ripped to shreds, I'm stuck trying to use a razor blade to pick the leftover pieces off my trim.It worked fine for edges of screenprinting/mesh frames, but then it turned a simple wall painting job into a nightmare. Sticks to the wall and rips the fresh paint up with it, primer and all?? Stuck to the door frame, stuck to the drop ceiling grid, good lord. Somehow, my paint roller pushed it back in many places, so the line it was supposed to be protecting is completely uneven and underneath is a mess - I lost track of how much time it took to get this tape off, and now I have to go back and either scrape the flooded paint or cover that up too.I thought I'd try this type because of the brand name, and because it was slightly cheaper than what I'd normally get. Just spend the extra dollar for the scotch brand!! I'm kicking myself!!!!!

It kept falling off everything I tried to stick it too. Going back to Frog tape or Scotch.

It may just be the roll I received, but there is a tiny crease on the edges of the tape of probably 1mm width, along the entire roll! This makes it impossible to line up on the floor while painting baseboards because the teeny tiny creased edge creep up the baseboard instead of easily tucking under the boards to protect the floor. Very irritating and I am going back to Frogtape, which holds it's proper shape even after banging in a storage box full of other stuff for six months. This tape is almost unusable and adds a lot of time taping and also cleaning the floor up where I tried to get the crease to lay flat. It has not improved as I have used half the roll.

You get what you pay for, at least in this case.The tape does not pull off the finish it is place on, but that is the only good thing that can be said about it.The usual purpose of painter's tape is to leave a sharp edge when applies so you can paint over the surface leaving a sharp & crisp painted edge.That is totally impossible with this tape. The edge of tape looks like the roles where cut to size (width) with a dull butter knife. The edges are so rough that it is impossible to get a sharp line.

It was a decent deal 3 months ago, when the price was $16.97, but it’s definitely WAY overpriced at $25.99

When I ran out of my 3m/scotch brand of tape, I just bought anything that came up on amazon for painters tape.  It's just painters tape, so I thought what is the difference on brand?This brand of painters tape does not work as advertised. It does not peel off easily within 14 days. I used it for 7 days on outdoor windows, which resulted in adhesive residue stuck to the window. When peeling the tape off, it does not come off easily and just breaks in pieces. If you accidentally tangle the tape with adhesive sides bonding to each other, throw the piece of away as it becomes unusable b/c the adhesive just rips off from one side. I noticed that the tape can't be reused once peeled off. In my application, I like to reuse the tape and the adhesive on this brand will not bond anymore.I didn't even finish the roll. I went to the hardware store and bought a roll of the 3m/Scotch brand, which works WITHOUT ANY of the issues stated previously.

Don’t buy. This painters, tape remove material when you pull the tape off. Also, when painting it does not make a nice crisp line when using this painters tape.

There are some surfaces that this tape has been sticking well to and other surfaces that it just doesn’t stick on at all. I am disappointed that I bought this pack of three rolls and I just doesn’t work well for what I need it for.In addition, the sides of the first roll I opened has little bits of excess tape attached. Like a cutter didn’t cut the tape cleanly and precisely. That was NOT acceptable for my use and kinda just ruined my project. The little pieces of edges got stuck in my work and would not come off.Based on my experience so far, I would not recommend this item.

The con’s outweigh the slight cost savings over 3M’s brand, the following problems existed in two different batches of the tape.-Would often rip unevenly while trying to pull out a 12”+ piece, causing uneven pieces, extra waste and work.-When removing after less then 48 hours of application it pulled away new (but fully cured) paint as well as years old paint.-When removing after less then 48 hours of application it pulled up varnish from our floors.The 3M tape used in the same locations did not cause the same damage, quite literally side by side the 3M brand Blue tape is superior in every way and the “Duck” brand resulted in more than 8 hours extra work in a single room to fix the problems it caused.

I am extremely disappointed in this tape. I applied to already painted trim and only left it on for 4 days. When I went to remove the tape, it pulled off paint everywhere. So, adhesion is good and it pulled away leaving a very clean break on the newly painted surface. However, the previously painted surface is now damaged everywhere and I have a whole other paint project to start over with: buying materials, sanding, more taping, repainting, etc. This tape did not live up to the description at all. I actually ran out of this tape and bought a different brand locally to finish taping off what I needed and the other brand of tape came off of the same surface perfectly - did not peel off any paint at all. DO NOT BUY.

This tape was awful, used 100% as directed and it pulled the paint off our walls in large chunks, would not recommend. Will definitely stick to the scotch blue products in the future.

Got A 3 R0ll Pack,4 Or 5 Days Later I Tried To Mask Off A Vertical Surface That Been Previously Painted .Surface Prep !Fine Sanding(320) Wiped Down With Tack Cloth. Before I Started Painting, I took A Clean Cloth With Denatured Alcohol & Thoroughly Wiped Down The Surface. Waited A Couple Of Minutes For The Alcohol To Evaporate.  APPLYED Tape Before I Could Finish An 8 FT Run The Tape Had Already Fallen Off Under Its Own Weight! ( No Added Paper Or Plastic Masking Just Tape !!)I Finally Had To Use Some Old 3M Tape So I  Could Finish My Job ! If I Find Anything This Tape Will Stick To, I Will Amend This Review.

Paint bled all under neath

This tape sticks to NOTHING!!!!!  Had to go buy a different brand.  This is the worse tape I have ever seen!

Total garbage! Pulled the paint off when I removed it and would really stick when applying it.  I shouldn’t have tried to save money.  You can only apply a few feet at a time.

I figured this brand would have the same basic characteristics of the leading brand, but my roll was a major disappointment.  It is harder to tear off, but then it does not adhere to even smooth surfaces to provide the holding power i needed.  Stay with the other brand.

I should have read more reviews before purchasing this tape. The tape has small jagged edges which stands out with any contrasting colors (It’s like they need to sharpen the knives before cutting the tape in the warehouse). I mean what is the point of taping if it looks like you tried to edge it yourself. Also, it leaves little blue tape after you take it up. Seriously, it is a crap product. The only positive thing I can say is it didn’t take up any paint when removing. Congratulations Duck Clean, you did one thing right.

Absolutely devastating spent hours prepping and painting a room only to have the ceiling ruined when we peeled off the tape. It peeled off paint that has been on the wall for 6 years!!!In addition to that it left a visible line of blue edging around the room. I would never pick this again over other painters tape on the market. Talk about feeling defeated!

I painted wooden shelving and used that tape. Not only it was waving on the edges making it impossible to stick straight but also got messy when removing. It left a very narrow blue line on the edge where the paint was, so annoying and so fine it had to be painted with an artist brush to cover it. Luckily I mixed that tape with a reminder of a Scotch tape. In comparison Scotch tape gave excellent results!I do not recommend the Duck tape.

The tape leaves behind a blue line of residue that is near impossible to remove - renders the tape completely useless. Invest in the Frog tape - they cost a bit more but will save you time and energy.

No problem with its adhesive ability. It sticks to whatever you apply it to - too well in fact. First, I used it for masking some trim in the master bath. It pulled away paint from the walls that was at least 2 years old. Next, I used it to mask hardwood floor around base moulding. You guessed right, it pulled up the urethane from spots on the floor. If you like creating more work for yourself, well then this the right tape for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and spring for a quality brand.

As you pull the tape off the roll it tears diagonally over & over again.

tape does not seal against medium (plastic), and paint bled through tape really bad. ruined the work piece I was painting.

When I took the tape off it would split and any tape that had paint on it would be left behind. It would also peel the paint surrounding the tape, giving my wall a bubbled look in some places. And it one spot around a mirror I had taped, it took off a couple layers of paint (some that had been there for YEARS) and left bare drywall. I purchased 3 rolls, and I will be returning the two that I didn’t use for this project and finding something else.

This tape will take the paint off of your wall. My local hardware store only had the 1/2" painters tape,  so I ordered this and got same day delivery.  I should have waited for a better brand of tape, because now I have to repaint the wall. Will probably work great to hold stuff together,  but terrible for painting.

Did half the rooms ceiling masked with 3m tape. Ran out so ordered this product and did the other half. Painted and removed tape within several hours of application. 3m tape remove small inconspicuous bits of paint, this tape took off large pieces. The paint that came off has been on that ceiling for at least the 14 years we've been hear and probably the full 22 years since it was built.AWFUL product - I am extremely unhappy that I now have to do lots of touch up which ain't so easy for an old dude.

This tape is terrible.  I've purchased I'll different brands of painters tape throughout my life and they've been relatively equal.  Not this stuff - I used it to paint our bathroom trim and it bled all over the walls and our hardwood floor!  I'll need to repaint the entire bathroom and spend 2 hrs trying to salavage the floor.  I read the reviews before I purchased and figured the negative reviews were just a coincidence but no.  I will never purchase this brand again and unless you want to paint twice recommend you don't buy it either.

This tape was low quality and very difficult to remove! When we used to it to paint our bedroom, it left ugly blue streaky stains on all the walls we added it to. Had to repaint a lot of our trim as a result…

pulled the paint off my wall.

Adhesive on this tape is so strong that it takes some arm strength just to unroll it.  Based on that I should have known better than to continue using it.  Sure enough, upon removal large patches of previous paint were stripped right off, which then had to be painstakingly touched up.  If Duck is going to make tape with such strong adhesive they should provide a warning in their advertisement, not hide it in fine print on the inner surface of the roll.

This tape pulled off the paint on our trim even when we removed it immediately. The edges of the tape are not consistently straight, and despite meticulous taping, it did not keep clean lines. I will never buy this brand again. The 3M tape was way better. This type is almost not worth using.

Worst tape I have ever used. Bled right through all around the entire room. Don’t trust the description they tell you it’s a lie!!!!

This was my first time using this brand of painter's tape. It will also be my last. In short, this tape sucks. While pulling it off the roll, it tears down the center very easily and makes it difficult to get a clean piece off. The tape was only on the wall for a few hours and yet when I removed it, it pulled a significant amount of (old) paint with it.

I usually don’t use painters tape because I’m an experienced painter. But working with epoxy and having just painted my bathroom I didn’t want to take chances. Now I have to spend another $40 on paint to touch up where this “clean release” tape ripped all the paint off. Not a happy camper! Get the blue painters tape from lowes make it easy on yourself!!!

This product is horrible and ended up costing me even more money for my painting project. It pulled the existing paint off of my molding so now I have to go through and paint all of my trim and do a bunch of touch ups because the paint bled through the tape. It also didn’t stick to some of my clean and dry molding. Don’t waste your time trying this product!

I have used painters tape many times in my life, but this particular one peeled off paint in every single area I removed it from.  Will be doing it over with a different brand.

Was using this to mask on latex painted surface with the really mild textured surface. Literally started peeling off the second you put any down. Might as well not even have been tape. This was such a waste of money

The other reviewers are not lying - this tape could almost be used as a non-stick coating on a frying pan.  It doesn't stick to anything.  It's the most useless excuse for tape I've used in my entire life.I had to use this stuff for caulking my counters - it wouldn't stick to the countertops at all, it fell off of the wood backsplash after mere seconds; it barely even works on glass.  I literally had to use gaffers tape to tape this stuff down every 10 inches just so that I could finish my caulk line.I have no idea what I'm going to do with the other 5 rolls of this rubbish.  Utter waste of money.

This painters tape definitely sticks when you put it down....and that is exactly the problem. It doesn't come up. i used it for baseboard trim in my 1926 craftsman bungalow rehab. due to this tape, I now I have to refinish the beautiful hardwood floors because when it was removed it pulled up half the finish. furiously disappointed in this product. buy a different tape.

We purchased this less then 3 months ago and used it for a recent paint project.  The blue paint on the wall was over 8 months old and this tape did some serious damage as you can see from the pictures.  These will have to be filled and repainted again costing time and money.  I would highly suggest not using this tape.

One roll worked well. The other two were defective - one has an entire edge folded over making it useless and the other has no adhesion and came off as I was pouring resin making of mess of my project which is going to cost me a ton of extra time trying to fix.Don’t buy!

I already had a lot of 2" painters tape but decided to buy this new kind that advertised 'clean release' since it was very important that it came off easily without hurting anything. I was stripping and painting our front door without taking it down. I needed to protect the expensive solid brass hardware with satin nickel finish. So I covered the middle with plastic and taped all around the edge up to the wood door. I read online to remove the tape very slowly and at a 45 degree angle. So following these instructions I was able to remove much of the tape okay. But some of it stuck to much and I had to pick at it to come off. This removed some of the lacquer protection on the brass hardware. So, although it didn't hurt my paint job, it hurt what it was sticking to. Now the brass is tarnishing where I had the tape, so I have to figure out how to fix that! It's possible my other painters tape would have done the same thing. But it certainly wasn't worth it to buy this.

I was displeased with the amount of paint leaking through the brand of painters’ tape I usually use, so based on the extremely strong reviews here, I tried this painters’ tape instead.While, I did not notice much difference in terms of paint seeping through the tape, I ran into two problems:1) When using around caulking, it leaves a blue line in the caulk when you remove the tape (the tape has been completely removed but it dyes a line in the caulk itself). It’s a fine line and not terribly noticeable but it is there.2) When painting trim and using this tape on the wall around the trim, it takes the paint off the wall. This is a big deal. I have to do a huge amount of repainting to walls (that had been painted for a year, so very thoroughly cured).I remove painters tape within a couple of hours of painting so as to get a nice, clean line and the other brand that I use has never removed paint from the wall (same brand paint used throughout house), so I’m blaming the tape and I am never, ever, ever using it again nor would I recommend it to anyone who likes the existing paint on their walls.

Halfway through roll the product lost all adhesive and did not stick and stay. Had to buy another one. But from a different company

That's what I get for saving a few $$$. I strayed  from my usual frog themed version and won't make that mistake again. Here's the thing, the tack on this tape is very heavy. I was using to mask a project and tearing foot long strips. If I didn't catch the ends, the cut piece rolled into itself and you aren't able to tear apart. Not like other brands. The worst part though, is when it attached itself back to the roll, it constantly tore in small strips when trying to start a new one. It was maddening. The tape seems too thin for how tacky the glue is. I think this would be a nightmare for removing too. In my 25 years of arting and home improvement, I've never felt the need to write a review about masking tape except maybe first time I used the green stuff :)

Though we pressed and pressed when taping to try to make the best seal, we still have paint bleed underneath the tape onto the trim. Now we have a mess to clean up. We painted a room black and it has white trim, so the bleeding edges are very obvious and will require some real work to fix.

This tape goes on easy, but won't come off; especially if any paint gets on it.  I had to go around the whole room with a putty knife to remove it.

This Duck clean release tape did not stick well to the plastic moulding on the windows making it very frustrating to tape and paint the wood around the windows.  It did adhere to the wood.

It adhered ok , but not as good as frog tape. It was fairly inexpensive and the quality matches that. Any tiny bit of moisture it will loosen immediately. Which is good and bad depending on your intended use.

Was very disappointed in the quality of this tape- nothing like the usual Duck brand tape I've bought in store. Must be some issues with the tape itself- breaks apart easily and allows for paint to get in crevices. When removing it from the wall it tears in the middle and leaves little parts of the tape behind. Never had this issue before with using this brand, quality control issue perhaps? Throwing out the second roll, not worth the headache it caused with one of my painting projects that had to be retouched.

Arrived squashed/bent. I sent this, along with other small winterizing things, to my mom. Unsure if it was shipped this way or because driver threw it by the road instead of door.

I bought this product because it was on sale and cost 60% less than 3M in the same specs. But at the end it cost me more than anything I ever imagined.At first, the tape seems to be doing a great job and it peel off clean as advertised. However, toward the last 20 yards or so, the adhesion has become too strong that peel off paint from the wall. This caused me an extra day in order to patch, sand and paint the affected area.Due to this weird adhesion consistency, I would rather pay more and go back to 3M Brand to avoid issues.

does not stop paint at edge

Ugh, had beautiful stripes with sharp edges—from a different brand of tape. Now have to redo the edges because this tape didn’t prevent bleed thru. Bummed.

This tape released without residue however the adhesive is much more aggressive than other traditional products making it difficult to replace if initial installation is not placed accurately.  It also split while removing and sometimes when unwinding from the roll.  We will use for something but not what it was purchased for.

This tape sticks a little too well. I don't recommend using it on freshly painted surfaces. I used it to label some cabinet doors that I primed a few days prior. When I removed the tape to paint them it pulled the primer off.

Easy to use adheres fine removes with ease...... However..... there is nothing "clean release" about this "painter's tape" ......... it took paint with it resulting in having to do big-ger touchups and worst of all, it stripped varnish off of moldings. ..... now we have to try to match and restain the moldings...... This should NOT be advertised as painter's tape. This tape IS NOT painter-friendly.

Do not be mislead by the positive reviews, this tape is garbage!!  We spent the last few days painting trim, and when we took this tape off, it ripped paint off the wall, and paint BLED THROUGH the tape onto the wall and onto the floor.  Isn’t it the tapes JOB to ensure that paint doesn’t bleed through?  Extremely disappointing.  I now have so much to fix and clean up because of this tape.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for quality tape so you don’t have to clean up a huge mess after the job is supposed to be done.

Doesn't stick well

Until you use a tape that"s of poor quality. You do not know how good the tape you've been using is. This tape pulls the paint off and does not remove as easily as Frog tape. You will have to use a utility knife to get a clean line when pulling it off.

Be careful! This tape doesn’t work as well as it should. Paint bleeds under tape

It’s nothing like the original I should’ve gone with the original. The adhesive is too strong to remove carefully, and when you do so  paint comes off because the adhesive is too strong.

Decent adhesion, a little stretch to help it bend around corners. Application is fairly straightforward.But removal is a nightmare. This stuff delaminates like crazy. As I pull it off (even slowly) it tears off in strips, leaving lots of bits still stuck. I have to use a utility knife to carefully lift up and grab all the pieces.I thought I could save a few bucks on this tape. Never again. Back to using 3M tape from now on.

This tape is super thin. Hard to tear compared to others. I am not really a fan. Kinda hard to work with.

I usually use 3m blue tape. This Duck branded blue tap is significantly stickier so it’s harder to get off walls and harder to work with. Worst part is, it leaves its blue edge on walls (see pic).

Taped around the periphery on the second coat and when I peeled the tape off it removed the first coat down to the primer.  Not everywhere just a few spots that needed some touch up but I bought this to try instead of the more expensive frog tape I'd been using with no problem so I can't recommend this over that.

Not good at all for painted surfaces, will lift the paint.  Other things, it wont even hardly stick too.  Thought I was getting a great deal, guess not!!

Used on 2 week old walls and it pulled random places of paint off.  On the other hand,  tape is good quality but way too sticky for use on paint that is less than a month old.

This tape worked well on some projects (on glass) but also ripped paint off some places. I painted my door a couple of weeks ago and needed to paint the other side a different color. I used this tape and it ripped that newer paint right off. I had the tape tape on just for an hour. I am scared to use this tape on my walls again.

Used this tape to paint a room.  This tape does not stick well to baseboard or to joints between wall and cabinets, making the paint job a frustrating affair. I have used the Frog tape (green colored) in the past and it simply is the best for a paint job.  I purchased this blue painter's tape due to the price, but what you pay is what you get, I suppose.

I use blue tape for slab layouts at my countertop business, and this tape is much stickier than Scotch’s.  I need to be able to move it around; therefore this is not a good tape for my uses!

Was very disappointed by the adhesion.  I've had much better success with the main competitor painter's tape.

Adhesion is bad in respect to painted car surfaces and smooth plastics. Either I got an old roll of tape or as suspected, the duck brand sucks.

I purchased this brand of painter's tape and made a big mistake.  This tape is very hard to remove and when it does release, it takes paint with it, requiring more touchup painting.  Very frustrating.  Stick with 3M.

Just spend the extra money and get the real deal. This tape is more like plain old masking tape than anything else.

Terrible for painting. Do yourself a favor and get green frog tape

Waste of time and money. The tape is probably fine, but I will never bother taping again... more trouble than it's worth.The paints seeps through the edges unless you really press hard. However, then when you remove the tape it pulls the wallboard off! Could be my walls, but I don't see the value...

Paint still bled a bit on the edges but stuck to my baseboard

it had surprisingly little adhesive(even by "painters tape" standards. and it took hella long tp be delivered.

I wouldn't call this clean release unless your intended purpose is to remove paint from your wall.

When tearing the tape off the wall it also took my paint off…..

This tape is too sticky as a painter's tape. Other than that, the quality is good. it is just not suitable as a painter tape.

left very obvious edges and didn't come off cleanly as hoped

I edged the walls to paint a bathroom ceiling. When I removed tape, it peeled wall paint in several places. Now I have four times the work ahead of me.

had this on for a few hours and it still ripped up my multimedia paper...

not easy to work with  as it tears...constantly

A Lot of paint bleed! I used this and between the paint bleed and pulling off of paint, I am very unimpressed!

Paint went underneath tape.  Had to purchase Goo Gone to clean up spots where paint spread underneath.  Came with enough tape to tape off 7 accent walls, with extra to spare.  Just wish it would have sealed a little more.

If you like your paint to peel off with the tape you should buy this:( and yes. I used a knife to scorn the tape and paint seem first.

Pulls off paint

This stuff is extremely low tack. It lifts off just about every surface I've tried adhering it to almost instantly. Should not be used if you are looking to get clean lines when masking off areas for paint. It does a decent job sticking to glass and

Painted an accent wall in the bedroom. Was happy at first that the paint didn’t bleed thru but once i removed the tape the next day, was utterly disappointed that the tape peeled paint from the walls on the sides! Extra work had to be done to repair the damage. Luckily, I still had leftover white paint. On the plus side, the tape is great for baseboard trims so at least I still have some use for the remaining tape. But I will NEVER use this brand when I paint accent walls again.

I feel like although we put this tape all around our house the paint still went through to the other walls or baseboards.

Took paint off and bled through.  Frog Tape is more expensive but does a better job.

Item as described but arrived 3 days past when promised and too late to use and they would not allow me to return it.

I have used painter's tape before, and maybe the adhesion was worse, but it can be cleanly off and easily. This version is leaving a sticky residue on my walls and window. It is not good.

The Duck clean release painters tape was a fallback strategy to the Scotch brand I usually get at a big box (orange) warehouse, but with the need to shelter in place, I tried a 3 pack of the Duck brand painters tape.PROS: It really sticks!  A lot! Well, a lot more than the other brand. Paint doesn't seem to seep as much under the edges of the tape. That's good!CONS: It really sticks! A lot! But that makes it more difficult to remove, and harder to use, because if you misplace it (for example, on door frames), it's much harder to peel back and restick in the right place. Also, when applied to painted sheetrock, at least recently painted sheetrock (a day or so later), it also has a tendency to peel off the paint it covers. This I noticed where I painted the interior of a window frame first, then the sill second a day or two later. Not too much of a problem pulling it off the painted wood window sill (to protect the sill while I painted the sheetrock surrounding it), but a much bigger problem when I then put new tape on the sheetrock (more than a day after painting), painted the sill, waited for that to dry a day or so, then pulled the tape off the sheetrock. And off came the paint (in some places) that was adhered to the sheetrock. As I said, this stuff is super sticky! Also, if you accidentally overlap the painters tape while trying to adhere it to a surface, you can't separate the two sticky surfaces at all. Just throw that section out and start over.This would be a great product if it were a little less sticky, but a bit more sticky than the Scotch brand.

I've always used the 3M blue tape. Thought I'd try the Duck brand - they're a big name, right?I didn't like it as well. It's too dark a blue to write on (which I do frequently) and I feel like it doesn't adhere as well.

Claims this tape is clean release but pulled off paint in multiple places on my wall. Super annoying

I bought this for a little paint project around the house and while the price is great, it was not a clean release and pulled off paint with it.

It lifted the paint off the wall when I removed the tape.

Super disappointed in this tape. It sticks well to general wall surfaces but will not stick to caulked trim at all while other tapes do

"Forgot to put enough glue on the tape." Had to clean up paint under the tape.

Works well for the most part, there was still bleeding and a few occasions of pulling paint off.

If 2 sticky sides accidentally touch, it's very hard to pull apart without messing up the rest of the tape. I didn't have this issue with other brands so I will probably switch back to them after I use up this roll.

Great tape no questions

Tape seems like regular painters tape, but it does not stick to surfaces as well as other brands.  If you have a somewhat rough outdoor surface. Get a better tape.

Use it for small projects, worked really well.

Paint came up with the removal of the tape. Paint that been there for two years. I was painting our white trim (baseboard, windows, doorways etc) when I painted the baseboards I put one strip of tape on the floor and one on the painted wall above the trim, when I went to remove it, same day, it pulled up the paint on the wall. So I had more painting to do after painting the trim.

Used this on a couple of walls where I have a black accent against white.  I really wish this had left a nice clean line but there was a lot of bleed through that needed to be corrected every time I used it.

Doesn't adhere as well as Scotch's Blue brand.Also, tape too dark for labeling items with black sharpies; which is something we use the tape for more than actual painting projects.

I used this tape when repainting a bedroom and overall I was disappointed. To be fair, it’s not all bad. It’s got great adhesion and is nice and wide, which is nice if you have aN unsteady painting hand or are trying to protect your ceiling or floors. My biggest gripe with this tape is in the removal. This tape has a hard time staying in one piece. You could be following it cm by cm as you remove it, and you’ll still get a random tear somewhere along the way. And not always big tears that are easy to remove: I’m talking those small tears you either have to ignore or pull out the tweezers to try to pry away. It’s incredibly frustrating and caused a lot of unnecessary extra work at the end of an already work-intensive project.

Be careful what you put this on. It is VERY sticky.

I think the adhesion is actually too good for painters tape as it pulled off paint when removing (area that was painted a year ago). It also leached streaks of blue from both sides of tape (some on wall after removal and some on white doors laid on top side of tape). It only happened a tiny bit… probably less than 3% of my job, but worth mentioning.

Shoulda ordered 2"

Tired of laying out the expense for replacement rolls of Scotch (3M) for painting, due to the kiddos laying down blue roads, rivers, railroad tracks, etc. all over the floor, not to mention hanging their art on the wall.Tell you what, this stuff is cheaper and comes up a whole lot easier that the "real" painters tape. I have no qualms -- the boys run rampant taping everything in site, but cleanup is a breeze.Would I paint with it? Um... probably not. Seriously, I noticed right off the bat that this tape seems to have an adhesion problem, and it's only lightly tacky against our textured walls. a 1" length holds up an 8x11 piece of drawing paper just fine, but it seems as if it only tales a light touch to lift an edge. I'd only trust it on smooth, very clean surfaces.So I'll be sticking with Duck tape for the kids, and a reliably tacky Scotch brand blue stuff for most painting tasks.

leaves a residue that is hard to remove

Bought this tape when I ran out of my usual brand. Biggest issue if this tape is way too tacky. Sticks to my ceiling and walls and tears off paint and Sheetrock when removed. Otherwise it’s ok.

One problem with this tape is that it is like a 2-inch wide strip of paper.  It has zero ability to flex.  Sometimes when painting, you want something that will go around a slight curve.  This doesn't,  it basically goes on straight as a ruler.  Also seems like you have to rub into place in order for it to stick when you are starting out.  If you are trying to stick this to anything that might be a little dusty, then it isn't going to work stick very well.  I have used Xfasten tape before and was much happier with it.  Should have gone with what I know already.

Used this product to mask off walls so that shelves could be painted with oil based paint. The tape was on the walls for 6.5 days to allow time for two coats of paint with a light sanding and cleaning between.The tape provided a nice line under which paint mostly did not run. HOWEVER, when We gently removed the tape, it pulled texture and paint off the wall AND left a faint blue residue along the edge where either it’s color bled into the paint or it’s sticky edge did not release from the paint edge. Either way, it’s unattractive and I won’t choose this tape for paint masking ever again.

I used some of this and some Frog tape with my painting project and the Frog tape adhered better, removed easier, and did not take off some of the paint with it. Some of the areas where I used this product required touch up after the tape was removed. I recommend the Frog brand instead.

We used this to tape off trim when painting.. however when peeling off after the job it left a blue line of sticky residue at the edge of where the tape was.  Will not use this brand again.

Sorry for the mess idk if you can see the tape but it’s an okay tape good for the price

Not as good as other brands.  Seemed to stick tight (causing it to leave marks on newly painted walls) but yet wasn’t flexible enough to not allow bleed through.  More of a tape for floors or other out of the way paint areas.  I’m probably going to use it more for various workshop purposes now.  Would suggest other tapes for delicate or more in the line of fire paint areas

The roll I started using seems like much poorer quality than the ones I used before.

This product is easy and works well for crafting items however, it bleeds when used on textured walls

Don't use with white paint This bleeds a little and left a blue line of adhesive along edge after removal.

I would have given this 5 stars if weren't for the tape being such a dark blue that makes seeing and marks or notations on it a bit difficult.  A little lighter in color would have gotten it a 5 star.  Other than that, excellent adhesion and easy to remove.

The whole idea of using painters tape is to avoid extra work of redoing baseboards and ceilings. This product will make you do extra work as it strips the paint off baseboards and ceilings when you try to remove after the paint job. Not a very good product compared to Scotch tape.

This tape is STRONG! Ripped the paint right off my wall.

NOT AS GOOD AS SCOTCH

Got this for my classroom to put up student projects since painter's tape is all we can use on painted surfaces. Didn't hold as well as I would have liked it to. It only really held up regular printer paper. Anything heavier than that (like cardboard or poster paper) fell down within a day (regardless of how many pieces of tape I put, and I put a lot!)

Its no better or worse than the more expensive blue tape, but the edges are not very clean.

Good value for the money, easy to put on and remove. However, some paint did get underneath the tape edge. Just scrape off excess paint with the edge of a plastic card/credit card.

it is not sticky enough...

This tape was so sticky it pulled paint off the edges when we removed it. This is frustrating because now I have to do touch ups 😭.

This went on easily and adhered well; however, it peeled paint on removal even though I had let the wall dry for 24 hours before applying tape. Very disappointing.

Didn't stick to good for me on the wall put did on the plastic lining

My only problem was that when I removed it from my car an hour after applying there was glue left on the surface.

Not sticky enough. Wont stay on.We wanted removable tape but 3m is better

Arrived in timely manner. Product does the job.

easy to use

We use painters tape to stick on boxes and bins for labeling.  This tape is a very dark blue so it does not work well for this purpose.  It works well as tape, but if you use it like we do, I suggest something lighter in color.

I use this for marking frozen foods, name and date. I did not realize how dark this blue was so if you use for same, be sure to get the light blue or ohter color of paper tape. Works great,  though!

This works just as well as other painters tapes. Some areas it sticks to better than others, but overall it does the job

This is a nice quality tape comparable to other brands that are more expensive.  I used it as painters tape and it did not damage anything. Good quality for the price.

Title says it all

Great tape no issues, sticks great and peels easy

Sticks well. Don’t leave it on too long or it might leave glue marks.

Sticks and comes off good

Good painters tape, Its thicker then most which is a plus but it also likes to tear unevenly so keep an razor knife or scissors handy

Nice product. Easy toOpen packaging around the tape. Dispenses wel, no bunching or ripping before you need it. Great hold with no paint bleed either.

For painting strips it works well do not leave marks easy to use

Good adhesion no bleed through. As always remove tape before paint is dry to avoid lifting fresh paint.

Quick n easy

Purchased the tape for a 3d Printer, but found it works get for other tasks. good adhesion, with no residue when removed.

tape works great for general purpose, but may have to press really hard on vertical applications to prevent paint bleeding. it only happened on a few spots, but wish it never happened at all. however great product for price point

Worked ok, but had many places that the paint leaked through, and one area that the dried painted ripped off the wall when removing.

Thinner than the last one I bought. I use foe sublimation

When I pulled the first few pieces off, I was not impressed with how sticky if felt.  However, after applying large strips to the wall, I was surprised as to how sticky it was when I went to remove it.  I am not using it to block out paint lines, I am using it more it keep the drips from the wall off of the baseboards.  (I use a brush to cut in the paint line when the two different colors actually meet.)My husband and I have been painting our 2000 sq/ft upstairs (took us 3 years because we also had to remove wall paper and add texture) and have used a lot of paint and a lot of tape.  I don't honestly know if it was this brand or a different brand, but one of them left a slight blue hue on our light tan walls that I then had to repaint over.  If not leaving on for long periods of time, I will be buying this again, because the price was less than some of the other name-brand stuff that I purchased.  But I wouldn't leave it for longer than 3 days, just because I'm not sure if it left behind the blue residue.

Better price online then in store

Rihht size paint tape

Works as advertised!

Great painting tape I had to use it for a painting project that I did with my dad. It sticks well on the walls and removes easily.

Easy to install and easy to remove,works well

See the title

Never had a problem with any Duck brand tape.

Have you ever painted a house interior?  Then you know you need painter's tape.  Lots of it.  DUCK CLEAN RELEASE BLUE PAINTER'S 1.5"  4 rolls  240 total yards for $17 is a good start.  Look out trim work.  I'm armed.

It's a good tool

Thinner than 3M

There is not much to dislike when it comes to tape. As long as it gets the job done im a happy camper. I used it to tape my AC up for the winter. My biggest complaint was that it left residue on my window when i removed it for the warmer months.

used about 5 rolls so far (2 orders)pros:- sticks well to all surfaces I've tried (drywall, steel, plastic, wood) except super dusty surfaces.- long lasting:  stays sticky for months after taping a surface (hasn't lost tact so far)- pretty clean edge (when masking latex paint)- good bang-for-the-buck (price vs quality)cons:- tears easily when removing.  perhaps too sticky, the tape frequently tears when removing.  The best way I've found to reduce tears is to pull up the edge opposite to the painted edge, however still too frequently requires me to go back with a utility knife to scrape off little bits of tape remaining.

I had tried other tapes including the 3m "original" tape that many 3d printing enthusiasts recommend however I found that either the PLA didn't stick very well to the tape (3M) or it stuck TOO well and left messy tape residue behind (another Duck tape).  This stuff seems to be the happy medium I was looking for: good adherence without leaving residue behind. I can't speak for it's application for painting though it seems like it would be fine but I do recommend it for the Ender 3 3D printer.

This is a good tape to use when you want to protect parts of the surface when applying solutions or paint. It keeps the parts under the tape clean.

Can’t beat getting this via Amazon same day delivery but the product wasn’t the best. Adhesion and removal was not the best compared to Home Depot blue tape. In a bind, you can’t complain.

This product was old and out of date.  The backing paper was rotting in the adhesive.  This is a good product when it is fresh but this package was not.  Don't buy this from this vendor.

Forgot I bought the tape then one day it came up where I required some painter's tape. This goes on easy and it keeps paint from bleeding. It worked better than expected. To remove it was also easy, I was afraid it may take come of the latex paint so I used a razor and followed the line where I had painted over the tape and just peeled the tape away with no issues.

Works good but there is still bleeding and the tape does not stick for long periods of time. For example, I used it to border a painting I was working on last night and this morning it was unstuck on some edges.I don't think it is too much of an issue if you're gonna use it for just a couple of hours. If it was stronger, it would rip the paper/peel paint beneath it when removing it (which is not currently the case!).

I had a good experience with this tape. I put down a coat of the wall's normal paint color first, let it dry, then painted the new color over it, which made for perfect lines. It was easy to remove and didn't leave any chipped paint or other flaws.

It works as expected and just as well as any other brand used before. Nothing special or different or any better.  Price seemed reasonable.

Good tape, but no different from the other brands.Store it right - use it right - remove it quickly.

I used this for taping up before caulking to get clean lines. It seems to stick very well on very clean surfaces but not to even mildly dirty. I think if the tape was stickier it'd be more versatile on other projects but for drywall and interior surfaces this will work fine.

Not quite as adhesive as I'd like, but it IS painter's tape.

It's way more sticky than most painter's tape.  That's really why I gave this a four out of five.  On the one hand sticky is great - but when you are trying to get the tape up off the floor and have to use a razor blade to get the bits closest to the wall, it's kind of a challenge.But it's painters tape...not a life changing problem for it to be imperfect.  The three pack is a great deal so why not.

Good item

It's really not the tape's fault but my usage was primarily for the kitchen.  Blue tape is a GREAT help when you're adding a million damn labels to the various food stuffs in your refrigerator.But this just doesn't stick to the glass jars or plastic quarts I'm using.  I mean it does well enough if you really baby it but it's a shitshow 9/10.When I go to splatter paint all over my bedroom I'll be glad to have it.  But for what I need it's not what I need.

It works like it is supposed too

Tape was as good as the most expensive stuff, would buy again ! Worked great for masking off rubber liquid roof coating on travel trailer. Stayed in place and removed clean and easy.

It does release cleanly; no sticky residue.  However, it does not stand up to wind and weather very well, when used to secure paper.  Good choice for masking trim; or for indoor use.

This tape is much cheaper than brand name painter’s  tape. It works well however it is little hard to remove and it stretches as you line up the edges.

I used this painters tape as a base layer for some wallpaper and foam panels. I got this tape in comparison to the other and was very pleasantly surprised! It sticks and has not peeled , was easy to lay down and tear

Bought this product to tape off areas on a project for my truck, the tape held up well. It functioned well not peeling up in any places. Easy to use, holds well. Will purchase more when needed down the road for other projects.

If you've done any amount of house painting then masking tape is familiar to you.  This tape is competing with the well known 3M Blue masking tape.  It looks very similar but I like it better:  The tape itself is stronger.  The adhesive is strong, yet lets go when you want it to without leaving a mark.  And best of all, Paulie's favorite thing, it's cheaper.  How can you beat that?  If you use masking tape as an all purpose thing, try a roll of this, you will probably like it.  Duck Tape came up with a winner here.

I really like this tape.  It's good for many things.  Good price also.

This tape sticks well and is easy to remove without leaving a residue. It tears easily by hand, making it easy to apply correct lengths of tape as you go.

I use the tape/glue method of attaching work to the cnc.  In the photo, I have a leveled spoilboard, "clamped" to the main spoilboard.  You can see the duck tape.For this to work, you need painters tape that's tacky enough, without being too tacky.  It has to stay put through the stress of using the cnc, then release relatively easily, not taking wood with it.You tape your table, then tape the bottom of your workpiece.  You "clamp" the backs of the 2 tapes together with thin ca glue (thin superglue).  So, you're only gluing the tape backs together.  You take the work off of the cnc by releasing the tape from the spoilboard, then taking the tape off of the completed project.I was using 3M 233+ tape, which I had on hand to work on guitars (I'm a luthier).  233+ is expensive, plus you don't need all of the characteristics of the 233+.  I've used cheap blue painters tape and sometimes it holds, sometimes not.We all expect precision work to come off of our cnc machines.  But, I need ultra precise.  I create one of a kind intricate inlay for guitars.  I not only do I make it for my fretboards, I create it to order for other luthiers.  This entails cutting out each shape, some very tiny, on the cnc out of expensive mother of pearl, soft stones, like turquoise, and out of combinations of my own making, like mop pieces in resin.The materials cannot move even 1/100 of a mm when milling.I've used duck double sided tape when using the drum sander, and it's the only tape I'll use to secure small wood blanks or resin that I need thinned.  So, I decided to give their painters tape a try.  It's more expensive than the average blue painters tape, but a lot cheaper than 233+ tape.It works brilliantly for this method of clamping.

Good thickness and hold well. I’m not using it for painting but rather for other needs that I don’t want duck tape but need larger thank making and easier to use

Trust the brand!  Easy to use, great size and fair pricing.  Quick ship too!

Arrived in time well packaged. The price is same as Walmart if you need it quick. I use the tape for taping the front of my car for extended roadtrips. Goes on easy and can be left in the car for up to couple of months and will still come off no issues. Plus does a great job at protecting the car's finish. Be carefull with no brand painters tape advertised on the site some don't stick plus after 2-3 days will leave a glue mess behind.

Tape was easy to use and tear pieces off. Painted my kids bedroom wall with a special design and this tape came in handy to deliver clean lines when peeling off the tape.

should be more tape on he roll

Quality product

This 4 pack of tape is applied quickly and removed easily without damage to my household.

and peel right off with no problem

Good

It was not easy to unroll and bleed once paint was applied- had some clean up too do

I found this tape to be a better value than Scotch brand. Easy to apply and leaves absolutely no residue.

I usually bought my painter’s tape at my local hardware store and it’s almost double price than Amazon. I love the large size. The best tape I found

I may just standardize in this 1 1/2 “ size.

Used for paint trim work and worked great

It’s tape painting tape not much to it.

Very durable and great value for your money. No residue is Left behind. It's the perfect size, no leakage

Even though there are so many other offbrand painters, tape out there, I haven’t found any that are as good as this one. It is so easy to use, and you never have to worry about finding the old ending place because it is always easy to resume using.

best thing i bought for painting wish the paint had turned out, it attached to my brick impressive and it did a great job

Does not rip lengthwise when tearing off a section of tape.  Not so thin as to be near impossible to start a new piece of tape.  Sticks well but does remove cleanly.

removes easily after painting, nice and thick

Come on, folks, it's painter's tape. You put it up, you paint, you take it off. For whatever it's worth, it didn't damage my walls or window frames, I'd buy it again.

Great tape

Works perfectly. Durable. No leaks

Used it to edge for painting project. It worked well and removed easily.

I thought when I purchase this that i would use it for what it is called for painters' tape. But no, it can be used for so much more and that is what I Love about this particular brand of tape. Leaves no reside, marks, or anything behind.  I promise this is the best tape you can buy and for this price. Go ahead get trust me.

Duck Brand is my favorite clean release tape brand. It quacks the competition out of the water.

Great product and sticks perfectly and easy peel off

I used this for sealing the edges around my window air conditioners, as I really don't want to remove the paint or leave goo on the window frame later. It sticks well, but comes off cleanly. The color is a little garish for this use, but I am unlikely to be featured in any home decor magazines anyway!

I made the mistake of taping off a room for painting with Scotch painters tape and it consistently allowed paint to leak or just fell off. Got this instead and have used this kind ever since...it actually sticks!

The tape works great. Really need it if you are doing any automotive painting. It does exactly what it is supposed to.

Had to repaint trailer this tape cover the tags so no paint got on official  numbers no problem .Tape came off easy.

I used it to paint my inclosed trailer it removes very easily

This tape keeps paint where you want it and where you don’t

Honestly, my kids use this to make webs all over the house. I buy this because it doesn’t hurt the walls at all. It’s great for crafts and whenever you need temporary tape. I also use it to put up temporary school artwork and stuff like that. It’s strong and comes off clean.

Just wanted a roll to tape for my back wiper down at auto car wash as they always get my back wiper. It works perfectly. Will use around headlights on car to restore the finish but protect around areas. Perfect size for me

this is so expensive at the hardware store or even the big box stores. This was a great price for the same high price stuff. It works great

I like This tape better than the last brand I bought. It is thicker and it seems to stick better. I use it in my classroom on whiteboards and also outside in the hallway on painted walls.

Compared to big box, great value!

This made clean lines and was great for the project I was working on.

Goes on easily and smooth, and is easy to adjust if needed. Even after a few weeks, it's still easy to remove and does not leave any residue.

I use this tape for so many different things with my toddler! Strong tape that I can use on so many surfaces without ruining the surface.

Seems just as good as 3M, but for a fraction of the price

I’ve used these filters for years.  My most recently purchased box of filters smells like soap or perfume and when we made coffee there was a strange odor.  When I requested to return this product I got a message saying it was not eligible for a refund.

I was shocked at how poor the quality of these bags were. The first time I used them to filter just a small amount of coffee grounds at less than boiling water temperature, the bag split immediately creating a huge mess. The same thing happened when I tried again with even less coffee coffee filtered even more slowly at even lower temperatures - the issue was clearly with the strength of the bag. The only way was able to keep to keep the coffee from splitting at creating a huge mess is by double filtering, which meant that the bags were used up twice as quickly. This not only makes the filters twice as expensive per filter as they advertise, but creates twice as much waste per cup of coffee, completely negating any l environmental benefit claimed by the company. I will never buy this product again.

These filters break and the coffee runs through.Waste of money.

These are great coffee filters.The problem is that are shipped in their original box.  They arrived with the BOX CRUSHED and PRODUCT EXPOSED.NO RETURNS allowed.

I opened the brand new pack of filters (Qty. 100) only to find partial packaging with only 8 filters.

On 16 November, I sent the following message to the seller; as of 24 November, I have received no response. I have purchased your No. 4 coffee filters for years [26 boxes] and, until my most recent purchase of 2 boxes (100 ea.), I loved them. The first box's "'never break' patented wave seam" failed every time, allowing grounds to pass into my brewed coffee. Each time I thought that perhaps it was an anomaly and that the next filter would be fine. Nope. The first filter out of the second box failed similarly and, since then, I've been using two filters for each brew. That's not what I paid for and certainly doesn't meet your advertising of promoting a "Healthy Planet" and "Quality with Integrity." I can provide a long list of Amazon order numbers from the past few years if you'd like to substantiate my brand loyalty. But if this issue isn't resolved, you've lost a good customer. [Addendum: They now HAVE LOST a customer.]

The bottom of the filter opens up developing a hole when hot water is poured over the coffee grounds. It wasn't just one of them I tested three. Have some #2s which work perfectly so WTH! Really tired of so many problems even coffee filters. Then trying to return them has been a nightmare. Have had quite a few problems with Anazon employees blocking deliveries and stealing. The return page is not working, the Amazon return at Whole Foods was the opposite of helpful. I have the words to express my feelings but won't use them here.

The filters tore when poured the hot water over the coffee in the Chemex.Nobody would return my call from the company after I called three times.We use two filters at a time to see if that worksWill never buy again.Great customer service from Amazon prime

Half of these have holes in the bottom!!!!!!!And there is no way to return it  and get credit.

3/6 attempts to make coffee since I got these have resulted in the filter splitting because the glue or adhesive can't sustain sub-boilong hot water temps for coffee. Seems like a top thing to have checked for.Total trash. Ruining good beans at this point.

These filters are completely worthless.  I tried to give them a chance but each time was the same.

These split at the seam and let everything fall through.  Unfortunately cannot return.

These, even though I followed the directions on the box, the seam came apart. Coffee grounds blew right through and made a mess. Would be better if they made these into a flat square piece of paper that you could fold up in 4 to then open up into a cone. No seam, no mess

After three attempts to filter coffee I gave up. Filter split open each time wasting expensive coffee. Useless filter

Poured water in and the filter split right along the seam like tissue paper.No returns or refunds either, so only buy it if you need coffee filters for anything other than making coffee.

Honestly, I don’t review too many products on Amazon because I order so many.  But when I get a piece of junk I feel necessary to warn other consumers.  This is definitely one of those products.  Very first time using a filter for a lovely cup of morning coffee and the darn filter splits on half and coffee grounds go everywhere and ruin our coffee.My husband swearing the whole time.  How hard is it to make a coffee filter meant to hold cofffer grounds?!  So frustrating.

First filterFine grounds in bottom’s of coffee cupsSecond filterSeam gave out and all grounds dumped into carafePoor quality. Don’t do it

I don’t often write reviews, but these filters are terrible. We’ve used 5 so far and 3 of them have bursted open with wet grounds going everywhere. It’s not the way to start or end your day. I’ll never buy this item again.

I used the filters for drip down cup. I fit the filter in the drip cup, put ground coffee in the filter and poured boiling water slowly. The bottom of the filter broke and coffee grounds went in the cup.Poured it out, rinsed the cup, did it 4 more times, very carefully. Still broke. I threw away the  2 boxes of filters that I bought. Do not buy, terrible product, waste of money and time.

I am 2 for 2 on the filters tearing through and filling my coffee container with grounds.  With a 0% success rate and not willing to waste more time or beans trying, I can safely say the product is pretty terrible.  Save your money.

Got these instead of others because they are compostable. Learned the hard way they start breaking down pretty fast. First time using it I needed to move it slightly after pouring in the water and the bottom broke allowing my grounds to pour into my coffee. After that I doubled them up and it seems to work better.

Doesn’t matter how eco-friendly these filters are if they can’t hold any coffee. They break after about 150 ml of water consistently. Need 2-3 filters to avoid spilling all your coffee grounds into your chemex

I bought these because they are a more eco-friendly coffee filter option. It took me a few days to figure it out, but I realized that once I started using these filters, my coffee tasted like I was drinking a bottle of perfume and no longer like the Ethiopian beans I knew I was brewing. I thought there was an issue with my machine so I thoroughly washed every component but the perfume taste still lingered. And then I thought to smell the box of the filters and realized that it had the same perfumey smell. I won’t be using these filters any longer. Switched back to my old filters and the coffee tastes great again.

Not for chemex …. Filter broke when I used. The picture showed the filter in a pour over machine, but the fine print on the label said it may not work on all machines.

This is absolutely the worst coffee filter. Both times I tried it, it split at the bottom and caused all of my coffee grinds to fall through. Amazon will not let me return this item for a refund. Very unfortunate.

We had fifficulty with the seams kerting go. We lose 20% of the filters. Pour very slowly and only on the sides or product will fail. We wrote for help from the manufactor. No respinse. No return. Buyer beware!

Very disappointed in this product. We have found that unless we use 2 filters each time we brew our coffee, grounds show up in our coffee pot.

The paper just collapse when I pour hot water

Coffee grounds fall through filters every single time. Worst coffee filters ever used.

I bought these for my pour over coffee and every time they open up at the bottom and the coffee grounds just dump into my cup.  They are terrible.  I will not buy again.

The very first two times I tried to make a pour over with these they broke through before the brewing finished. Very frustrating waste of expensive coffee and time.

I want to like the unbleached type filters, but this brand really fails hard.Used with a pour over drip and made a huge mess.

We ended up throwing them away as too many coffee grounds got into our coffee. Went back to the regular Chemex filters.

In my most recent order both boxes of the filters constantly fail and fall apart from the hot water.  I now am doubling and tripling them so I can make coffee and they still fail.  Great idea for your health but completely unreliable to function as a filter. I've wasted so much coffee because the filters fail. Hopefully they'll fix the issue.  I can't recommend these filters as a good option the way they are currently produced.

No return option allowed :(

But these looking for a environmentally friendly filter for use with pour over coffee. The second filter out of 100 simply ripped out of the bottom one hot water was poured over it. Messy for sure. He’s just simply like the strength to be reliable. If they’d of had a return policy at all I would not have left a one star review. Let the buyer beware.

I need to agree with other people claiming these cones break. I used these filters 3 or 4 times and had the bottom give out twice.  I also folded the edges as instructed. If you use these in a coffee maker you’ll likeley never have this problem, but if you plan on using these in a manual pour over they will give out while your stur durring the blooming stage. Both times that it happened to me I was applying very little presure.  They’re just weak.

I have used these filters for  pour over coffee and occasionally have found some grounds in my coffee. the latest box I received are defective. the bottom of the cone opens up and half to three quarters of the coffee grounds are pushed into the cup!  i strained the coffee with a gold filter but even though I use 5 measuring cups servings  per coffee cup ,the coffee was tasteless and watery. second day in a row.  I did noticed the paper was thinner than in the past.

Every filter breaks open. I don't understand how there are 5 star reviews?

The seal on the filter breaks every time hot water is poured over the coffee grounds. Turns into a mess and a waste of coffee grounds.

These filters are absolutely terrible for two reasons. First, they make your coffee taste like your drinking from a brown paper grocery bag. Even aver you rinse the filter with water, it still retains that flavor...completely ruining the coffee. Second, I found that the filters break easily with coffee grinds spilling into the cone. These filters are not very durable. I recommend going with bleached Hario filters instead of any unbleached filter.

This product is very poor quality. I only used it 3 times , but 2/3 times while making coffee the bottom seal broke and all of the coffee grinds fell through. Don’t waste your money or your time. They belong in the trash.

These are crappy and they tear when my chemex. Should’ve just bought the brand name.

I DISLIKE IT

These are just horrible filters.  At least 40-50% of them break/split/come apart washing all of the coffee grounds down into your coffee cup.  So frustrating!  I wouldn't trust them to line a bird cage!

Whenever I am down to my last cup or two of ground coffee beans, these filters fail.  I use a Clever Coffee Dripper and when the bottom of a filter breaks open, it is not only a mess, but a total loss.I have a lot of failures with this brand.  I'm going back to M----a.

About one in three break. It’s the most frustrating thing. I prewet, I pour slowly and yet they inevitably burst open. Waste of money.

Literally every one I've used has ripped through. I've been giving it new tries for a week, at multiple points in a day. All have failed.

Bought these expecting them to be great, unfortunately they are constantly breaking during our pour overs.  if you plan to use these for any type of pour over coffee method save your money and look at another product.

On first use it tore and we wasted fresh ground coffee.

These filters are so much better than the super white bleached variety.  They are sturdy and do not fold over to create a mess in the coffee maker.  The flavor of the coffee is better when filtered through the brown paper.  The delivery was punctual, and the product is as described.

"If You Care" products are pretty good. I buy them when I can as I like that they are all unbleached and chlorine free.The #4 coffee filters work fine in a typical brew system or in use with a pour over style. I had used it in the latter and found that if I pressed the filter with my hand to squeeze out the last of the liquid from the coffee grounds, that it could tear along the seam. I don't think most people would encounter this as most people would use this for coffee to drip into using a machine. But just keep it in mind if you have a need to hand pour hot water over ground coffee- just let gravity do its job, and don't bother to help it along by squeezing out the rest.It is compostable! After you make your coffee, toss it all into your compost pile!They seem to make their products with care. Whenever possible I select one of their products over the typical beached or plastic laden product. I am not at all perfect in how I treat my environment, so even if I could do a lot better, I like knowing that t here are companies creating products that help us to have the "Least possible environmental impact" in our day to day lives.

Work great, and bottom seal stays sealed regardless of how hot the water is!  Happy!  Note, cheaper brands don’t always hold up to water, the seal can separate and let grounds drip into your coffee.

A much more economical filter than in local grocery stores and recyclable

They tear VERY easily when wet, or even dry.  Follow the instructions - fold them and they work perfectly fine.These cut up or blend well (with water) for adding to compost.

I can't tell you if my coffee tastes better or not with these filters, but they seem like they're pretty durable filters that won't disintegrate on you.  Saying that, I now purchase these coffee ground filters from the grocery store; it's cheaper at the grocery store (regularly-priced at $5-something at my local grocery store) than Amazon

I use compost in my garden so after I use these filters I add them to my compost and boy do they disintegrate fast! It works great in my coffee pot, my coffee tastes great and the filters fit well.

If You Care #4 Cone Shaped Unbleached All Natural Compostable Coffee Filters are an excellent choice for coffee lovers who care about the environment. These chlorine-free filters are FSC Certified and made from unbleached paper, ensuring that no harmful chemicals end up in our water sources. Plus, they're compostable and biodegradable, reducing waste and helping to protect our planet.I appreciate the strong "never break" patented wave seam on these filters, which guarantees durability and prevents any unfortunate coffee disasters. The fact that these filters don't compromise on taste is an added bonus, allowing me to enjoy my morning cup of joe without guilt.The bulk buy option is also a plus, with each pack containing 200 filters, so I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

Excellent quality. Hold wet coffee grinder without the filter falling apart.

They work. Don’t add any weird flavor to my coffee. Yes you do need to fold the bottom and side as the instructions state. Perfect for my pour over coffee

Ok so I’ve made about 8 cups of coffee using these filters and 2 out of the 8 have ripped and released the grounds into my coffee. I have been folding according to the directions and it still rips every once in a while.The up side to these filters are 1. They’re compostable. 2. They do not change the flavor of the coffee at all. It produces a great tasting cup of coffee when it doesn’t rip.All in all, they’re a great, cheap alternative if you’re willing to risk them ripping every once in a while.

Not a fan of packaging. Maybe if the box was sealed better. Filters exposed to elements. They also split open during brewing.

I did not have the problems that others are reporting but the seams on these filters are too wide, causing a large fold-over and non-conical shape that is about 1/2 cm too low on the seam side of the cone.  Possibly just a bad lot, but these can't be used with more than about 1/2 cup of ground coffee in a #4 cone-filter drip coffeemaker or the grounds come up over the edge on the seam side and drip into your carafe.  I have never had a commercial cone filter that simply did not fit!

The filters lose their seam which creates an open hole for the coffee to rush through without getting filtered.When these filters hold their seam, they are great. The first batch that I bought, only about 10 lost their seam. However, this current batch that I bought, almost EVERY filter loses its seam. And for some reason, this item isn't returnable so I'm stuck with a defective product that doesn't work.

I've never experienced a coffee filter that rips this often - I shouldn't have to fold up a coffee filter every time I use it either. I've had to refilter many many cups of coffee and I'm finally canceling my subscription.

these split open about every 4 or 5 filters. I will go back to Melitas

These filters kept breaking on us and we’d end up with a cup of coffee grounds

These are too big for my ninja coffee bar. I go to close it and it folds over itself. I won’t purchase again.

Expensive and non-returnable. The same quantity of unbleached filters is available at Trader Joe’s for $1.99. I like these filters, but not at that price difference!

I usually find these to be excellent and like to put used filters in my compost. My most recent box has had almost every filter break through as pouring over. I subscribe and save this product, so this quality issue is unusual. Has manufacturing changed for this item?

They break too easily. You’ll need to use two.

It’s great that this filter made without bleach and nuture looks color. But it needs 2 or more layers  when filtering the coffee because it drains too fast.

I like it’s earth friendly but it’s terrible when it comes to draining coffee. It takes forever! After three very slow pours I’m done trying

So far 2 out of 5 filters used had a hole in the  bottom. Very frustrating to find your cup full of grounds...

Just regular filters, no better that Trader Joe's ones.

Too big for being advertised for nenja coffee bar

package arrived completely open. and the paper is too thick for the melitta drip I use for my coffee.

A little too small for the Ninja Coffee bar.

I have used paper cone, pour-through filters for many years. These are too insubstantial. They let the water through too fast, so the coffee doesn't brew fully, and they break VERY easily if you try to adjust or move them in any way while brewing.

I’ve been using this product for quite a while. I end up with at least some coffee grind in my coffee every single time. Sometimes it’s worse than others. But this morning was so terrible that I thought I would register my complaint: This product fails to do what it was designed to do - keep the coffee grinds out of my coffee! Too bad… but it’s true.

In 2020 I tried a box of the #4 cone filters.  It was really good.  So 5/2021 I bought some more (not from Amazon :D), and it broke 3x out of 20.  I tried to contact the manufacturer but their site's "submit" comment didn't work.  So,  what's with the degraded quality?  I really like this brand's concept & price.  So could it be my fault?  I don't know.

Flimsy; had to replace the filter (and use double) to refilter the coffee I was making as they kept breaking and the coffee grinds would fall into the cup. Tried them with the chemex (broke almost immediately) and the pour over (had to keep replacing them as they got so clogged the water stopped dripping through). Waste of money! Can't be "eco" if you need more than 1 (or 2) to get the job done.

They leak!  Water bubbles up around top of cone and sometimes spits onto countertop - or hand!  Today there was a 1/4 inch whole near the bottom seam - had to start all over, pouring out the ground-filled coffee I'd already made.

Much thinner than expected. I’ve been purchasing this size of filters for many years - this is the first brand that have been so thin. The flavor hasn’t been hurt, but I’m constantly paying extra attention to not get the filter wet so it won’t rip.

I need to use 2 filters at a time, or the hot water runs on through too quickly when using a pour over.

I have used many different If You Care products over the years.  This is the first one that's been disappointing.  I bought an hemp filter for a Chemex and hate it because it is impossible to get the coffee grounds out and a lot go down the drain.  So, I bought these to put inside the hemp filter.  Every single filter I've used has broken and allowed grounds into the hemp...kinda defeating the purpose of buying these.

These have a very strong cardboard / paper bag smell and taste. Another reviewer mentioned that they impart an unpleasant sweetness, and I agree. I rinse them aggressively before using them, but they still affect the flavor of the coffee.For mediocre coffee made for the caffeine kick in an office setting, they are OK, but if you're using high quality beans and a good brewer, these are a poor choice in my opinion.I have not had problems with the seam bursting. At home I used these with a Bonavita BV1800 coffee maker and it is necessary to fold over the seam for the filter to seat correctly in the basket.  At my office we have a generic coffee maker and with it, folding on the seam is not needed.

These are ok.  Just don’t try to take the filter out after coffee is made, it is thin and when I went to remove the wet filter with the coffee grinds it fell apart, well wet coffee grinds all over the floor!  Make sure you use the basket to empty the wet coffee grinds and then its fine.

These are fine however I have not seen any difference in using filters from Melita or Trader Joes.  The manufacturer states they will not rip - which would be an upside.  I have had only 1 rip (Trader Joes) while tossing it into compost.so for me, the price difference is not justified to buy these.  Great to see more products that are environmentally friendly.

After receiving a confirmation for shipping, I tried to track the package and found "Sorry, ..." there are no details. I sent an email asking for details and still only given a date of shipment, but no tracking to my state or city. When the package did arrive, I noticed it was not from Herbs Pro, but from Universal Herbs. The filters are too tall for my machine, but I can make it work if I fold them. They are thin, but I like the idea of helping the environment.

The seal of the filter breaks easily.

In my latest batch of filters, every few days one breaks through while filtering. :( I am careful and gentle not to over fill.

These are flimsy and will do the job, but the quality and sturdiness lacks. With careful handling they will do their intended job. 3 Stars.

Make sure to read the directions or they will not work

I used these and they were okay.  However, I won't repurchase as I find them thin.  Twice the paper fell apart after use causing a coffee grind mess.

Doesn’t drip quickly enough so will overflow if you make >8 cups in a Technivorm Moccamaster.

They work okay, but some were too thick so the water wouldn't go through them, so I ended up with grains in my coffee.

These were not my faorite coffee filters. We did use them all but went back to using the ones they sell at our grocery store.

I was trying to avoid bleached filters, so I bought these - but they're seriously not sturdy, and they leave a strange aftertaste in the coffee...

wee bit thin and the price went up so I went with Melitta filters the next time.

Little pricey

Cool

Slright

Overall good filter with good flavor.Good certifications and eco friendly!Only con with this brand as they tend to break through the bottom occasionally (more common than the competition, not enough to really complain).Tip: rinsing a paper filter before use removes any paper flavor that you might taste.

they work fine, I ordered a coffee maker along with these and the coffee maker arrived the next day and these took 4 days to arrive. I had to pick up some other filters in order to use the coffee maker, I ended up going to a higher end grocery store out of convenience and paid the same as these for brand name bamboo filters that are a little thicker and stronger. That being said had I shopped around for the brand name filters I'm certain I could have gotten them cheaper making this not such a good value

I NORMALLY REALLY LIKE THESE BUT OF THE LATE PAPER HAS HAD STRANGE ODOURS, SO IT MAY BE GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IS THERE SOMETHING A CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT IS NOT BEING MENTIONNED THAT IS NOT SO GOOD FOR HUMANS? SURE I AM REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE FILTERS THAT ARE NATURAL AND BIODEGRADABLE BUT ARE THEY HARMFUL FOR US? THE REASON I AM SAYING THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE SMELLS, ONE TIME SMELL OF MOTHBALLS , ANOTHER TIME A PETROL LIKE SMELL, SO I AM NOT SO SURE AT THE MOMENT.

When my coffee maker beeps to tell me all the water has been dispensed and the coffee is done, there’s still quite a bit of water left in the filter. That may be a good thing. The filter is squeezing every bit of oil/flavor out of the bean. But I think it’s a hair too slow. I have to stir it for some time before almost all of the water has drained through the grounds (sometimes ripping seam of filter, releasing grounds). As I said, some may find the slow release desirable. I do prefer them over flimsy filters.Update: I switched back to oxygen bleached filters and realize now how much the cardboard flavor from brown filters was tainting my coffee. Will never use brown filters again. Plus, I don’t have the backup issue.I tried a different brand of unbleached before going back to white and no matter what I did, they constantly flopped over the grounds during brewing, resulting in truly disappointing coffee every single morning. I’m done with brown filters.

iT'S FINE, BUT SHOULD BE CALLED SIZE 2 AS ITT

We’ve had no issues with these!

These doubled in price. I could have bought them at Wallyworld but they are usually less expensive on Amazon. Think again. You used to get 2 for this price. Still better than the bleached ones.

These are fine. No problems.

I had no problem with the coffee filters. Not one tore or allowed coffee grains to seep through to my coffee. Nor, did I have to fold the edges. These are much the same size and weight of other paper filters I have used. I wonder if other reviewers are not used to paper filters and treated them roughly. The unbleached, natural coffee filters are a definite plus. I recommend and plan to order again as needed.

I'm using these filters with my coffee maker and they work great.  I fold on the seams, just like the instructions say, and I've had no problems with the filter tearing.  Though it does feel like it could tear, so I do handle used filters with care when I toss them. I'm an average coffee drinker, I don't taste any difference in using these compostable filters vs a regular filter or the "gold" mesh filter that came with my coffee maker.  Hope they work just as well for you.

I put these on subscribe and save and we had been using for several weeks and couldn’t figure out why we were getting grounds in our pot. Realized that these filters are JUST enough smaller that when we make a full pot (12) cups, the filter gets full and everything runs over it instead of being filtered out.  If you only make short pots, it won’t be a factor. It is a problem for anything over 10 cups, though.

I have been using these for a long time but the most recent box has left me with grounds floating if not properly folded.This did not used to be an issue.

Easy clean up

These work nicely in a clever dripper, the system I use for making my coffee.The only difference I can tell between these and your typical store-bought filters are that these seem to be a little bit more dense.  How that affects your coffee I cannot speak for because my coffee tastes the same regardless of which filter I use.  I'll definitely mention that it's a nice peace of mind knowing these are 100% recyclable and are made environmentally friendly.

Be careful about the pricing. They offer a single and a double pack. The single pack is $4 and change. Yet the double pack is $10.and heavy change. I really don't understand whey I can order qty 2 single packs fre a little over $8.00 and the double pack is well over $10.00.Otherwise, I really like the product. They work very well and I like the fact that there is a double sealing on the edges of the cones. Great value for the money if you buy the single pack.

The filters do what they’re intended to do. They do have/add a different taste/note to whatever you brew. I like this brand right now.The filters can be prone to splitting at the bottom. That could just be a user error.I don’t like receiving opened boxes, I wouldn’t buy an opened box item in a store.

The majority of the time this filter is perfect, but I give this product 4 stars because I have had the bottom fall apart a few times. It's not too big of a deal but is slightly annoying when it happens. But overall it is a great product and I recommend it to anyone. I use this product with the "Cyril Ash Reusable Burr Manual Coffee Grinder and Pour Over Coffee Maker" and it is perfect for what I need.

They work well.  Week made and efficient

Unfortunately, I purchased the wrong kind of filters for my coffee maker but I was still able to use these in the meantime. I love that they are eco friendly and they worked well.

These are not the "Correct" size for our Presto 12 cup percolator. As an add on the price is so worth cutting a tiny hole.Always use unbleached filters and these have worked great fitting around the coffee filter cup in percolator.

These work great, but have to be careful because the bottom will give out sometimes and dump all the grounds in, but you can just refilter at that point. Would still buy again.

They perform well, and I would have given them 5 stars except they are very fragile when wet.  Manufacturer suggest folding each filteron the seam prior to use, and it doesn't tear so easily on removing if you do that.

When I put these in my coffee-maker, the hot water goes through them and turns into coffee, without letting the coffee-grounds go through. I'm pretty sure it's also environmental friendly, which is nice.

Most brown coffee filters are still bleached even if they're labeled "Natural." I'm trusting these are truly unbleached. They're thick enough to absorb an appreciable amount of the acids in coffee which results in a smoother taste. Well-priced, too.

Not a very good value unless you just like having things delivered to your front door.

Filters are a little too tall for my ninja Coffee Bar. Good filter action, work as expected, otherwise.

Great coffee filters!Only downside is the glue used to hold the box together is weak. I had to tape it back together.

Great filters. Minus one star for what is quite possibly the most passive-aggressive company name I've ever heard.

Great filters.  The price is too high.  I bought an identical box at Natural Grocers on 8-20 for $3.49.

Filters good, doesn't tear but I still prefer the Melitta.

A substantial unbleached filter that will do the job as well as a unbleached store house brand.......maybe better for the environment?

I love these filters. No bleaching, all natural. Exactly what I wanted.

They filter the coffee perfectly but I have to cut them down 1/2 inch.  They are a little tall for my Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker.

They work just fine, but I can buy them at a local market in Dan Diego at 1/2 the price.

Got the job done

Very nice and easy to use with my pour over unit that fits over the coffee cup.

Good filters, but perhaps they could design an easier way to dispense the filters.

Good fitting filters, but expensive.

Great quality.. great price... 100% without a single failure or tear.. Will definitely purchase again

Does good job with its intended use.

Good quality. Work exactly as you need them to. Never had an issue with them.  I've reordered them multiple times.

the product descriptions are confusing, and there are too many sizes. but these work well

You should buy these paper cone filters... like, if you care.

Its coffee filters

Does the job.  I'm not convinced that the brown filters offer much better over other options.

These coffee filters are so epic! You gotta get them!!

Sturdy, work well, no problems with tearing. Will buy again.

These are great!

Good product.

I like these, for the $$ they are very good.

They’re flimsy, but if you follow the instructions, they get the job done! And they’re eco friendly!

They work well.

I like these filters because of the weight (not flimsy or too thick) and that they are able to get thrown in my composter.

Unbleached is the only way to go. Thank you!

These filters are easy to separate and easy to unfold and put in place.  The resulting coffee tastes smooth and full-bodied.

Perfect filter for single cup brew. No waste.

Like that they are unbleached

I have a #2 pour over and had been using the #2 size filter though it didn’t work well and had a lot of issues with the environmentally friendly filters. Accidentally ordered a #4 and it ended up working way better.

Update: I should have read the instructions that say how to fold the side and the bottom. They work great.The bottom of the filter opened a hole when pouring hot water over the coffee grounds. It has happened to all the filters so far. These filters are terrible.

Much better than bleached filters. These work great.

Great filters. They don't leave any taste.

I like these filters and was sad to see how expensive they'd gotten in my local grocery stores. So save a little with ordering online.

Great product.

They are a great product

I use these filters for the base of my container plants.  I am assuming there are not a lot of chemicals in its manufacture.  It works really well allowing water to flow through without soil.

This is the only filter we use in our house. Fits well in the machine and also filter the coffee well.

Perfect product. Coffee seems to taste better too.

I use it every day and it's great quality. Never breaks when using a pour over and it's compositable.

Works great.

Great filters for making coffee.

I've been using these for over a year now and never had one split on me.  I was a little nervous when I bought them the first time, but they've worked perfectly. You can buy with confidence.

Nicely boxed, easy to use.

I liked they were a natural product to use for my coffee

I like that the filters come in a box that fits neatly in a cabinet. It's also easy to get a filter out. I have been using them for over a year.

Was using the wrong size filter for a while. Glad to have the right one.

We have a MOCCAMASTER coffee pot and I just wanted to comment that these fit the machine perfectly and put out wonderful coffee. Would recommend the filters.

Not sure what makes these eco friendly vs regular filters.  Maybe the fact that they are not bleached white.  Okay.  They are sturdy and fit my coffee maker perfect - so good for them…

Perfect for my coffee.

Love these coffee filters! They’re cleaner than most, fit our machine perfectly and the quality is consistent. Highly recommend

If you enjoy coffee like I do, I find using the cone filters drives up my stress levels; spreading the filter each time is upsetting.This brand has changed all that; it has a tab to open the filter with so,  making coffee is a breeze now.

These work perfectly if you have a Ninja Coffee Maker or any other coffee maker that requires cone-shaped filters.

They work as expected

We got these for use in a Ninja DualBrew Pro, one of the CFP300 series. They fit perfectly and make great coffee. They're sturdy, so they don't tear or make a mess after use. They are compostable as well, so just an all-around good choice for #4 coffee filters.

I got an incredible case of the conscience when I figured out how much plastic I was dumping with k cups. I bought a pour-over coffee maker, my favorite organic coffee (BJ’s brand), and now I just compost the day’s coffee grounds for next season’s garden. They break down nicely.

Love how well they fit the coffee maker

True story: After an annual physical a decade ago, my cholesterol count was through the roof. My doctor asked if I used perforated coffee filters for home brewing -- the kind with the tiny holes in them alleged to maximize taste ("flavor enhancing micro-perforations"). I did, so I quit them. My cholesterol plummeted.If You Care's unbleached, all-natural #4 cone filters are my go-to non-perforated coffee filter. The fact they're responsibly sourced, biodegradable, and compostable is wonderful, but I love them because they're tasteless, they never tear, and produce a rich coffee in which the flavor of the bean shines through.Just a best-in-class product that gets used daily, and a terrific value at this low price. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking "Helpful." Cheers!)

No issues with change of flavor or anything like that.  They work and they are packaged without any plastic or the normal non compostable garbage.

These here filters filter my coffee right nice. And they fit in the thing for the coffee (Cuisinart) real dang good too.

These really are a step up from the every day bleached white ones but also seem to be a better grade of other brown unbleached ones I have had.  Sturdy paper that cleanly filter. even fine ground, the water through them making for a smooth coffee.  Will definitely get again.

Due to the fact that this box arrived partly opened I had to throw it out and order a new box from a different store, so 1 star to partly opened box.I bought a new box from a different store complete seal and safe to use filters.  The filters work great and coffee tastes good so 5 stars to that.

Sturdy and dependable paper cone filter. Fold edge and bottom before filling with grounds. Tastes fine. Fits all cone shaped makers I've tried. In a few hundred brews using a Ninja auto-drip, I've had zero cone failures.

I have been a believer in Frog Tape for the last few painting jobs I’ve tackled, but I ordered this one through Amazon to save a trip to hardware store. Big mistake since the one I received DOES NOT stick! Made for a difficult and sloppy experience so eventually I pulled out my old roll of blue tape to get the job done.

If my worst enemy called me to tell me they were thinking of painting their house, I would tell them to buy frogtape.  It ripped up all of the paint along the edges & broke off in pieces.  Bled through under the tape.  Worst painters tape I have ever used.

Complete garbage, doesn't stick to the wall at all and the paint is very low gloss.  Maybe eggshell.  DONT BUY

The product did not work as advertised. Paint soaked through the tape and got on the walls in spots. When removing tape it tore off some of the drywall and I had to buy drywall patch kit to repair it. I followed directions exactly. Very disappointed.

Don't waste your time or money on this green Frogtape.  It doesn't matter if your walls are freshly painted or cleaned or primed or textured or flat - this tape is frustrating garbage that will have you screaming at your walls.Please do yourself a favor and buy the yellow Frogtape. I've tried the blue painters tape, this green garbage and the yellow Frogtape in two different houses over the past 4 years.Winner: yellow Frogtape. Actually sticks to the walls or any surface and makes super crisp lines.2nd place : blue painters tape. Sticks 80-90% of the time to most surfaces. Even textured plaster. May stick TOO well and pull off paint when you pull off the tape. It really isn't meant for doing more decorative painting (stripes, chevrons, etc)Last place: this green Frogtape. If you like screaming obscenities, you'll love this tape. It rarely sticks to the wall (and stays stuck, that is). On most occasions when it did stick, I would come back to half of it hanging off the walls :| And I've tried every instruction provided and tricks like taking a credit card and sliding it against the tape to help it stick.I think you get the jist.It doesn't work.

I bought this to tape off parts of my stairs while I stained the railings and painted the spindles. I knew not to put the tape on anything wood with stain & poly. I first stained the railings so I taped areas of the white painted (last painted several years ago) spindles. After staining I took tape off, only an hour or so later and the white paint on spindles peeled off. Ugh! Great....now I get to repaint those!  Another area I used the tape to protect painted drywall (again, painted years ago, not fresh paint) and pulled the tape and it pulled that paint off. Kind of useless to use the tape if you are going to wind up having to repaint the areas you're trying to protect anyway. How does this company sell a product that does not work at all????

Everyone said to use the green tape over the blue for more detail. I painted and printed the room with Behr inherit matte and 2 months later decided to plan my mural with frogtape. After three days i didn't like my initial design and took the tape down (I hadn't painted anything besides the initial prime yet). The next week I noticed there was a pink residue/ interaction where i had put the tape on the wall. Over the next few days, it was more prominent. Everywhere I had put the frog tape was now pink.(The color under the primer was grey, so I'm not sure where the pink came from).

I have always heard the Frog Tap was the best out there so decided to spend the extra amount over the normal Blue Tape. Had the Frog tape on for less than 3 hrs then when pulling it off pulled off paint on the walls. Now I have to repair and repaint my walls. Thanks for the extra work frog tape.

Bought the tape to make it quicker to cut in but even with pushing down the tape with a putty knife the paint bleed through. Better off just cutting in

No tape is good enough to justify this much single-use plastic.Frog Tape: just stop it. You suck.

I had a lot of painting to do and I purchased a couple of sleeves of the 'other' brand 'Blue' tape.  I have a little bit of painting left and I didn't want to run short of tape; I was putting in an order withe Amazon anyway, so I thought I would get a couple of more rolls when I happened upon Frog tape.  It seemed to get good reviews and was cheaper, so, Why not?  What a mistake!  Absolute garbage.  Why do I do this to myself?  I had a good thing going and thought I could get away cheaper.  Now I have a job.  No nice smooth lines like I was used to, I had to buy real tape and redo my corners.  Maybe one day I'll learn.

I had always used blue painter's tape oh, I heard frog tape was way better and then painting an entire house I just purchased. After painting the ceilings I use frog tape on all of them before painting the walls. It took all of the paint underneath of it straight off the ceiling I thought maybe it didn't work well with ceiling paint but I've used it on the walls around the trim of the windows as well same thing. It does stick really well but it's going to remove any and all paint underneath it which defeats the purpose of painters tape. How does this have a good reputation?

The tape started coming off while the painting was being done. It didn't seem to handle the painting we were doing, and I don't know why. Also, as the tape came off it took off ALL the paint underneath it. I have no idea how it managed to do that, but I have to repaint my baseboards now. I just bought this place so I have no idea what variant of white the seller used for these baseboards...Not super impressed. I'll be using regular masking tape from now on.

I've boughten FrogTape from improvement stores and have never had an issue with it. But this one time I decided to order from Amazon since I needed to order a bunch of other things.The tape I got from them did not want to stick to anything, it kept peeling up after a few seconds and would not stay down. I ended up having run to the store and pick up another one, which had none of the issues that the Amazon roll had..So either the tape that is being sold on Amazon is old, or it is not being stored properly, causing the adhesive to degrade..

It ripped off existing paint on wall and now I have to pay someone to fix it!!!

Perhaps your results will differ from mine, but I found this tape to be utter garbage - just about as bad as other edging tapes I've used in the past. Moving forward I'll go back to making a clean edge the only way I've found to work: using an angled brush, a steady hand, and a clean-up rag to get the "oops-es" while they're still wet (and therefore relatively easy to wipe clean).

Ruined my paint job.  The tape was on the wall for two hours.....upon removal it tore the paper off the drywall.  I used the blue stuff my entire life...no issues.  Used this once...never again.  Absolute garbage.  Now I have to repair the drywall and repaint.  So angry right now.

pulled off what it was adhered to.

This product is OK, but not great.  Sometimes hard to get it off the roll without tearing.  Somewhat easy to get off the wall, but definitely leaks even though I put great effort into sealing to the wall.  But to double in price is ridiculous!  I will have to look somewhere else to replace it.

Remove paint randomly that it supposed to protect. Paint was new and dried for 7 days. So it should be pretty strong. Still it removed paint in some places and I have repaint the edges of the ceiling that it supposed to protect. When removing it tears apart sometimes. Overall  I would not use it at all. I think most of 5 star reviews are fake. No way such crap generated so many good reviews.

I needed this tape to work as advertised and create a clean line of no paint once it was removed. Made sure it was flushed to the back before painting. Not only did the paint go underneath and through it, but it also took the paint off where I had placed it. Now I have more work to do. I ended up taking the whole thing off and freestyling the painting as neat as I could.

IF YOU WANT TO RUIN 12 HOURS AND 11 APPLICATIONS OF HOME MADE SHELLAC THAT LOOKED LIKE GLASS THEN THIS IS YOUR TAPE. I applied a quick thin wiping of DNA which does two things., 1. it softens the shellac and removes any human oil and dirt from handling, then distilled water on the sides of the guitar headstock, applied the tape perfectly. pressed firmly and what I thought was a perfect seal ended up an unperfect bleed through. So many hours wasted. Now I have to remove the 11 coats I applied and start over again.Thanks, Frog Tape You Guys Rock, just not on this guitar!

I don't know whether the tape I got is not really FrogTape, or just old/exposed to too much heat & moisture or something, but it would not stick to my walls at all. We're in the midst of a big painting project and the FrogTape that we've been buying at our local home goods store has been working great; guess I need to keep buying it directly in person from legit retailers rather than online.

its ok

Do not buy this! It’s garbage! The only things it will stick to is clean glass, vinyl window frames, and itself. It will NOT stick to painted walls or clean tile floors. Don’t really think I did anything wrong, cleaned the surfaces to be masked, allowed a very sufficient time for it to air dry, wiped it with a dry cloth and then tried to mask - it failed miserably. Grabbed a role of 3M Blue painters tape and it adhered flawlessly.

"Last purchased Oct 29, 2022Size: 4 Rolls, 1.41" x 45 Yds | View order"  Great tape but I only received one roll. I could have ordered just one in a case that was 1.41"x 60 yds for less. This is a terrible error on their part.

OMG so hard to remove n it leaks through. going back to the blue one

Opened the container to a layer of white dust and the tape was torn like a strip had been used. No way to know how long it actually is. Never had this issue with a store bought container.

Showed up with the case completely broken with a missing lid.

The media could not be loaded.
                



It didn’t do what it was supposed to do. “Absorb the paint and not let it travel underneath the tape” although I pressed very firmly on the edges.

This stuff is too strong, it ripped the primer off and created more work to fix and don't think it was any better than regular blue tape

I love Frog tape and find it to be the best painter’s tape, however, the product I received must be very old as it has no stick whatsoever and has completely ruined several walls I had painted. Very disappointed as it was a complete waste of money!!!

Best tape. Prime nightmare on deliver & communication. (lack of) 1st Customer service person (very nice & sincere) yet  ‘totally incompetent’, made problem worse. Today, Second cust service person (very nice & sincere) “guaranteed” this prob will not occur again. I’m leary, will wait & see what happens next.

This paint tape was beyond disappointing. I painted an entire house, and then decided to splurge on the tape for my trim. And ah- I was horrified when I peeled it off. It bled EVERYWHERE. Even on glass. The perfect smooth surface that even dollar store tape can protect. Not only did it bleed, it ripped off my paint in several spots. I'm including photos of the bleeding. Do NOT buy this stuff. Hopefully mine was just a bad batch, but I wouldn't risk it.

Total garbage. They changed the formula to make it more sticky. Now it completely removes all paint underneath it and is extremely difficult to remove. The lines look awful too. Thanks for nothing Frog company. Literally just caused us to touch up our entire job. This is horrible.

I saw this advertised as a premium painters tape so I gave it a try. Huge mistake. Tape blend badly and my edges and corners look terrible. Also, when removing the tape from my trim, the tape removed some of the existing paint from the trim. All directions were followed for using the tape. Just a bad product.

Attempted to stick on ceiling and it kept falling off. Ended up just not using it. Some spots it stuck well but the majority it did not.

Don't feel it protected my wall any better than your average blue painter's tape.  It's really not worth the extra money. Lines weren't very clean and it peeled the paint right off my freshly painted wall I was trying to protect!  (I followed instructions exactly and was careful)

Did not work any better then blue tape

I used this on my bathroom door and on a canvas. Both look horrible after I used the frog tape and paint.

I've used this tape before, and never had the issues I have had with the 4-Pack I just ordered.  The tape goes on fine, however it pulled off a bunch of old paint with it.  I had an older roll that I used with the new roll and the old roll did not have this problem.

This tape did not stick to anything! It was absolutely horrible.

This tape would not stay stuck for anything! After all the hype I was really disappointed. I was trying to paint my new front door.  Wiped it down to get rid of any dust and taped off the edges.  I  kept pressing it down along the flat edge and it would release again in a couple minutes. I'm going back to my blue painter's tape.

Thought buying expensive tape would help with my painting project. Despite the cost, this tape didn't work any better than the cheaper options.

This crap won't stick to ANYTHING. Won't stick to painted walls in the bathroom and no one has taken a shower in the past 8 hours. Wouldn't stick in the kitchen either and left a bad looking paint job... Thanks. The wider tape worked so idk why this is so much different but it is! It's not even slightly sticky to the touch. Wish I could get my $ back

This is fresh tape on the wall. It has the adhesive level of a freshly licked lollipop. A God damn stamp has more glue than this BS!

This did not stick to stucco at all, I thought it was made for rough surfaces, apparently not

This tape must be old because it doesn’t stick, at all. Of course I didn’t find this out til just now, the night before I’m going to paint when all the stores are closed. I’m so angry. Do not waste your money on this garbage.

This tape sucks! When trying to paint the adhesive did not work. It kept lifting up from the walls and moves around when I was using stencils so the design was messed up.

I ordered 4 x roll pack and I only received 1 roll. False advertising.

I don't know why people are obsessed with this tape. It's so expensive and it doesn't even rip straight. Also, this tape peeled my paint off of my wall.

I love Frog Tape & I use it for practically everything which is why I hate having to leave a bad review. I’ve bought Frog Tape from Home Depot before and it worked amazingly. But, like other reviewer‘s have stated, the one time I ordered it from Amazon the tape would not stick to anything, right out of the box. I unrolled it a bit hoping it was just the end of the roll that was defective, sadly that didn’t help. It sounds like Amazon got a bad batch or are not storing it properly. I would buy it from the department store until they figure it out.

So , I don't normally leave reviews, but I figured this was worth it. I bought this tape with the impression it's better than the legendary blue standard tape, wrong, this tape sucks , the paint seemed to leak through the tape and get where it shouldn't. So just to compare I did one wall with this tape and the other wall with the blue painters tape and sure enough the blue tape did a lot better.  This tape does not hold up to the claims and I'm very disappointed as now I have un even paint lines in my daughters room , I was looking forward to this loving up to the hype,  im very upset ....

I'm unsure how this stuff has such great reviews maybe we got a bad batch. Better to buy it as a single roll vurses milti pack.It didn't stick to painted walls for more then 1 minute before slowly feeling off, walls were completely dry and clean. When ripping it off trim it would come off in small chunks.Would I buy again? No, I'd buy the blue stuff from the local hardware store for a fraction of a cost that has the same quality without the big name.

I used this tape to paint the black stripes shown in the photo. I removed the tape and tried to paint the lines where the tape was removed with white paint. The sticky residue ruined the piece I was working on. I had to sand it off and start over.

This product is not as good as the painter's tape from the Dollar Tree. It doesn't make perfect lines as advertised, and it bleeds like crazy.

I am a total fan of Frog painter’s tape but this tape seems to be missing some if it’s adhesive or something.  The same type of Frog tape that I bought from a paint store sticks really well and blocks paint but this tape does not.  I thought I was getting a good deal price-wise but that didn’t end up being the case.  I certainly won’t buy it here again!

The tape claimed a clean pull for up to 21 days after application.  Left it on for only a few days to give some trim work a few coats.  Pulled up the wall paint in several spots when removed.

Frog tape is normally about the best painters tape you can buy… the one I received did not stick to anything, it immediately fell off. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase another frog tape- which worked like it’s supposed to. Not sure what happened with the one I got- maybe it was old.. just buy it from the store!

Not impressed. Supposedly you can leave this on for 21 days. This was on for less than 30 minutes, and pulled off the paint beneath (which was painted four years ago, so obviously it has cured). I honestly didn’t see a huge difference from other brands in terms of paint bleed, either - it still bled. Now I get to dig out that four year old paint to fix this.

I had to repaint the trim and door. Tape was on for a couple of hours then when I removed it, the tape took off a large section of older paint. Also not as good of seal as I have seen in the videos

Read all the reviews and even seen many people use this tape. This tape was not tacky at all. The beginning few feet was and then it just wasn’t tacky thereafter. Made my job so difficult. Awful. I bought the three roll pack too. Such a waste of time and money. Should have gone with the classic blue tape.

It's not what it's cracked up to be. Works about as well as regular blue painter's tape. Doesn't matter how much you push it down or rub your finger on the edge, it still bleeds underneath the edge. And I didn't just glob the paint on. So don't waste the money to 'upgrade' to this tape. Not worth the added cost.

Product is too sticky. It pulled a lot of my paint off the wall despite it being a good quality Benjamin Moore paint. The research I did said this was the best but it did not work for me. Now I have 6 rolls but am afraid to use it anymore. After reading some more reviews I see I am not alone. Better to throw away the tape and keep the container.

Not impressed.  I suspect that a "real painter" may be able to mask with this stuff better than with regular masking tape.  But I also suepct that "real" painters can cut in better than I can so it seems irrelevant.  I bought this product because I bought the advertisement that it would leave clean lines.  It does and it doesn't.  About as well as cheap generic masking tape.  There may be a trick to it but it's not "paint blocking technology"  so save your money and buy huge rolls of the cheap stuff and expect to do a bit of touch up.

I've used Frog Tape before and it's worked great, but this time, it's terrible! Every place I pulled the tape off of, it leaves glue behind. I'm really disappointed in this product and I will send back the 2nd roll I have.

Used several different sizes of Frog Tape for making lines on a wall I was painting. Not one single line was crisp. There was bleed through on every line. Looks good from a distance, but not up close. Also peeled paint off of my wall that had been dry for over a year... Not good.

I bought this to mask off stained wood trim so I could scrub tile grout. It didn't stick very well. I thought this would be the right tape to use. Maybe this was my error? I dont know but it did not work for this purpose.

I have tried using this for a clean tape line, but it hardly sticks and despite pushing the edge down repeatedly, it still comes off and paint weeps underneath. Will never buy this tape again. I have almost two rolls unused and it almost creates more work than it saves when painting.

Leaked paint contrary to their advertising & pulled up paint. Did not know different levels of adhesion are available. I should have noticed & ordered differently

Super disappointed.  This messed up the paint on every single riser on my stairs and even pulled up the stain.

I used this when I painted a couple of rooms. The paint peeled when I took it off. I this real frogtape? I expected better results.

Paint still seeps through. Does not quite ensures a nice line for accent walls

No. Very sticky, but we painted two months ago and STILL can’t get the tape off. Peeled off the paint from the tape we could get up. Do. Not. Do. It.

It was okay to use on my floor and counter but it pulled the paint off the wall I was trying to protect.

Used the tape for accent lines. The tape edges start to peel up a minute after application which makes it hard to. Complete your desi3.

It's as good as frog tape, but I found no use for it. Yes, it protected the covered areas from getting paint on them. It kept a clean line. But at one inch it's neither thick enough to hold down the edge of a paper or plastic drop cloth edge, not is it able to be enough of a barrier on an edge to safely paint with only a tape barrier. Go big or go home.

When I was done painting and took the tape of the canvas it did get underneath the tape.

This is my third time using this product and every single time no matter how i use this product the lines come out with twrrible bleed thru. This final third time i even had to repaint a lot of the edge work with different tape.

Good tape. Just not for painting.  Pretty good bet it’ll pull off any paint that it adheres to.  Stick to scotch 3m blue.

Have painted every room in my house, haven't yet had it not bleed.  If you want clean lines, use something else.

Stick to 3m blue painters tape. We ran out of this tape and had some blue painters tape leftover from another job. When we pulled the tape away, there was no comparison, the 3m tape outperformed the frog tape hands down. Lots of bleeding with the frog tape. It barely sticks to anything either. Very poor product.

It’s no good this is worse then the tape from dollar general! Sorry guys it let me down :(I now have to repaint all the edges and corners because it didn’t work, waste of paint and time!

I won't use again.. when removed took everything with it.

I don't see any difference from using regular painters tape or masking tape, except that it doesn't stick that well. Mine was falling off the wall.

Does not work on textured walls, beware!

Paint bled thru do not buy

This tape was useless.  It didn't stick well enough to be effective.  It would fall off before I could even paint.  I don't know if I got a bad batch because the other ratings were good which is why I decided to purchase it.

Didn't give clear paint lines, it bled a lot. Disapointed.

I did not like this tape. It was hard to remove.

Doesn’t stick as well as I thought it would.

I bought this for a paint project and figured I would splurge on the frog tape because i have heard such great things about it. this did not work any better than generic brands. don't waste your money!

I followed the instructions and my lines still came out with bleed through.

not the best painter tape i have bought

tried using this because i heard that it works better than regular blue tape but i didn't have that experience.. it lifted a lot

no better than the blue tape. save your money...

Doesn't really work as good as advertise.

Just use regular painters tape. I do tons of projects and this tape was recommended as the premier of painter's tapes. not worth the extra.

This stuff is nothing like 3M blue tape. Doesn't stick well at all.

Doesn't work any better than the regular old blue masking tape. Frog tape provides online videos on how to use the stuff abut applies to any tape as far as I can tell.

Nope, the tape didn't give me a sharp edge, it bleeds.  Not much different than any other painters tape.

I have been working with this stuff for years, not the same stickiness as before. Honestly the last roll had no stick at all.

Came in damage, ordered replacement and everything is good now

Used this to cover the trim while painting. The tape constantly wanted to curl in on itself while being applied, which ment I had to use small strips. Upon removal it was revealed that paint had bled under the tape in multiple locations, and the tape took some paint with it in others. In the worst locations the tape had to be removed with a knife to assure an at least somewhat straight edge.

Please note, I do not use this for painting, so I can't speak to that function. It has a hundred other uses though. Not sure when they changed the adhesive on the "blue" painters tape, but I no longer use it.  This tape has the perfect amount of grip, comes off easily and seems more durable. Oh, and don't pay 10 bucks for it at Lowes when you can get 3 for 20 here.Update:  watch your reorders!!!  The first time I ordered these they were 18.00. The next 20.00, and the last was 25.00  The reorder is now 40.00!!!!  You can buy 3 rolls at lowes for 30.00 so do not buy here!!!

I had often heard that this was supposed to be superior to the ‘blue’ tape but I would have to disagree. I found the tack on it to be nearly non existent so I had quite a painting mess on my hands. It just isn’t sticky enough and paint just flows right under it. I’ve been using the blue tape for years without issue prior to this and have now already replaced my inferior green tape. I can now say I tried it and I gave it away. Go blue!!

Tape worked on small first paint job.  Stored it in its case for couple of years & it no longer sticks.  Cheap masking tape lasts longer & works just as well.

The green tape case was broken.

This Frog tape did pull off some paint. It didn't seem to matter when the tape was removed. Pulling slowly and not at 90 degrees with the wall helps. Sort of peeling it off slowly. Still, there were areas where it peeled paint. These walls were painted within the last year.Given the price, I'd probably use another brand that works as well. I've had the same results with blue painter's tape. Maybe trim by hand next time.

Not sure if my design was too complicated or the heat made the paint more fragile but I recently took up a painting project in my room I used this tape for the entire design. When it came time to take it off it pulled the paint under it. I had followed the instructions on the back and even given it an additional day to dry/cure not sure what went wrong. Overall I would purchase this tape again the lines where it worked properly were clean and I love the outcome of my wall even if I had to retouch it

I'm not a professional painter and we have walls from 1921 in our apartment that has not been painted well many times over so the walls and moldings are in pretty bad shape to be fair to the tape. Plus not using water based paint...who uses that? Anyway Latex paint from Homedepot, but I did wet the edges with a damp sponge first to "lock and seal" the tape. It still doesn't work much better than regular painters tape. In places there is a very clean crisp line and others bleeding. Again walls and such are probably one of the worst for this test, but it didn't pass.

Three stars because it does give nice clean lines, but it's not sticky enough at all. It didn't want to stick to anything but itself. Peeled off flat walls and forget about door frames. Any angle it wouldn't stay. In the end we got the job done but it required tons of touch ups.

I usually buy this tape for painting at my local stores but this time it didn’t stick at all or it would stick and I would turn around to see it fall if

It does its job well; I just think the problem is there is no good painter's tape.PROS:- It does work better than others I have tried (3M, Gorilla).- Paint doesn't seem to bleed through the tape.CONS:- I received two rolls that were warped. It is unclear whether there was some moisture in the container, heat, or a manufacturing defect. This made it hard to make straight lines.- The edge created is not very clean with latex paint. Make sure you have some very fine sandpaper or an xacto knife.

Used to tape edges off my watercolor paper before painting.  VERY challenging to remove- tore the paper every time.

So I was hoping this would be the answer to clean edges on orange peel.  Turns out that is not the case.  It does have more stock, but I still experienced edge bleed.  Even worse, it pulled some paint off the walls upon removal.  For general painting I’m going to stick with the blue stuff. But this may be helpful for certain applications.

I feel like I received a used item. See photos. I usually purchase this from a department store such as Walmart, homedepot, lowes. So I'm familiar with this product I feel I got jipped and received a returned item. Overall, it works well and does a great  job to get clean lines.

I found this harder to use than other tape and paint blead around the tape. Not only that, but when I pulled the tape off the next day, paint from the sides came off as well

I am not sure about the whole multi-surface thing, I struggled with this tape. It has pretty light adhesion for obvious reasons. However, when painting a medium/light textured walls with gloss paint, the tape would fall off the ceiling if it wasn't backed with another layer. Made taping take a bit longer. It did work well on the smooth wood base boards, but needed to use another tape for everything else.

This tape did not block paint from getting through. The results were similar to regular blue tape.

I would love to know why I was sent an item without a lid?? I’m sure the tape is fine but this is a little suspicious

Work well overall. Suggest to take tape off while paint is still wet. Cannot leave on too long or paint will stick in areas.

I tried this on the premise that it would absorb some of the paint before it allowed it to bleed over.  It did not.  I painted.  Then pulled the tape off.  In one small section where I over did it the paint bled through where it was not supposed to.  The underside of the tape was clean (it didn't absorb the paint).

Performance comparable to similar tapes from other brands. Reduces both under-tape edge bleed and paint pull-off when removing tape but some of each will still occur. Certainly better than what we used for years. Be nice if it had a little more tensile strength to resist tearing upon removal, especially removal from irregular surfaces (sconces, etc.). It's enough better than the old tape to justify the slight cost increase to use this in a project but doesn't completely eliminate frustration.

So the big thing about this tape is it's not supposed to bleed through so you get clean crisp lines.  Maybe I didn't push hard enough when I used it, cause I stll got some.  It appears to work pretty good, but I don't know if it's better than the blue painters tape or not.  I think the key is just pushing it down hard on the side thats going to be painted near.  I did that on my 2nd round, and it worked better.

Turns out "paintblock" doesn't work like its advertised. The paint just seeps under it.

For me it’s the same 💩 as regular paint tape nothing special

I take the blame here.  I tried Frog Take on a woodworking project.  I wanted to use analine dye on one part and keep another part natural.  This is not a job for Frog Tape.  The dye leeched through and forced me to re-sand and basically re-do the component that I was working on.I can't speak for a paint job, but dyes on wood is not for this product.

I have lots of Frog tape, and have been very happy with it.  However, this roll does not have enough tack to it to suite me.  My other rolls are 1.5 inch, that might make the difference, in any event, it does not seem to stick well.I've given it three stars for its poor performance.

Price was great but the tape itself doesn't adhere very well to matte/satin/eggshell paint. When it does adhere the edge of tape doesn't fully contact the wall so you will have some paint bleeding behind the tape.

Didn't stick to my semi gloss walls.  Still needed the blue tape.

It was ok. Still bled through.

Made the task of recaulking bathtub around edges harder. Had to redo everything as tape did not adhere properly.

Used it on a pine 4x4 and there was a decent amount of bleed-through. Was able to achieve better results by taping and ensuring the tape is on the top of whatever you are painting to ensure drips don't seep down into the tape...

I disliked how the storage container it was in, the whole reason I bought it, was broken.  Plastic bottom was damaged so it was no longer able to lock shut.

Doesn't stick very well and to my disappointment it does pull the paint off in spite of the claims that it doesn't......Next time I will go with regular blue painter's tape.

Decent for the price, but it didn't stick to the walls as well as the blue stuff.  We had to go back and reapply some areas where it had fallen off in the 5 hours between taping and painting

Leave rough paint lines after painted and removed.

Didn't work as well as advertised. Paint still bled under, and lifted some paint when removed. I probably won't buy again. It just seemed weak to me compared to the blue tape I've used for years.

Better than blue for painting but expensive

It’s ok still seeps paint behind

The stick-um is very weak, and it does not hold very well.My intent was to put it on my greenscreen wall as reference for chroma-keying, but it keeps peeling off; perhaps it'll stick better to other items, but it doesn't really get the job done for me.

Works alright. Gave it three stars cause I've never really used painting tape much so I can't say if the results were good or not, but they looked decent

I dont know why people are going crazy over this tape. I guess it does seem to give a better seal than the "blue one", but there was still some bleeding. Maybe I did something wrong.

I have always used 3M tape but thought I would give this a try hoping my paint wouldn't bleed under the edges. There wasn't any improvement using this tape.

bleeds when painting

Still had a lil bleed under on the edges, I'm not a pro, but this stuff really helped, did pull a lil bit of my original wall color off when removed!

Its an ok tape not the best it bled some

Does work better than the blue scotch painter tape but only had tiny bleeds every once in a while

Doesn't stick as well as 3M blue.

I bought this tape to hang up drawings in my dorm room, and so far, it’s been working great! I’m using just a small amount of tape to hold each paper, and it lays flat against the wall, which I was pleasantly surprised by.It’s also really easy to remove, and two weeks in, none of the drawings have fallen off! I also found that I can easily remove the tape from the back of my drawings without damaging the paper (just regular printer paper), which is a big plus.One thing to note: If you're using this tape on painted walls, I recommend replacing it every month because if left on too long, it can adhere to the walls and take some paint off. Additionally, I wouldn’t recommend placing it in direct sunlight for extended periods (like two weeks) because the adhesive can start to melt, leaving residue on the wall.

It works better than the Blue tape, but it's still far from perfect.

Frog tape is the best I use it for everything

A bit of a challenge to apply perfectly straight (I'm very fussy) but when I accomplished that with a bit of practice, the ceiling and baseboard lines came out quite nicely. I'm no painter (hate it actually), but I saved maybe $500 by doing it myself and though I do have some touchup, I am pleased with how well the tape helped me out.

I use it for painting on canvas as a beginner. Works pretty well

Way better than the blue stuff

The product mostly worked well. We did have some paint bleed through a little bit on the trim. It's best to take off the tape slowly, but even still we had to get a small knife to get the tape near the edges to completely come off.

I used this tape while painting my room because a friend told me it was much better than the blue painter's tape you usually see. I ran out of Frog Tape on the final wall, and had to use the original blue tape... and honestly, it did the same, if not better than the Frog Tape and is much cheaper. Frog Tape does the job, I just don't know if its necessary.

Have had frog tap recommended to me by many professors and have used it in the past. This time around the adhesion is crazy strong and has torn up my canva artboards. It works great on regular canvas and canvas sheets but the canva artboards get ripped up everytime :/I also recommend rubbing down the edges of the tape to make sure no paint get under the tape!

The tape held securely in place without damaging the surface underneath when I removed it.The only small issue I encountered was that the tape didn't stick as well to textured surfaces as it did to smooth surfaces. However, this isn't a major problem and is something to keep in mind when using painter's tape in general.Overall, I would definitely recommend. The tape is easy to use and provides excellent results.

Worked as expected.

Use this all the time easy on easy off will buy more works great on the walls

Does what you'd expect it to do. Still has paint bleeds on textured walls but works perfectly on smooth surfaces. Learned a trick though, take a little bit of the paint color of the wall your applying the tape to and paint over the edge of the tape first. That way any paint that bleeds through matches the wall it's seeping onto. Then allow that to dry for a bit before using the actual color you're wanting to pain the opposing wall. Not sure if this works with all tapes but worked like a charm with this one.

TOO  STICKEY  AND REMOVED FINISH  TOO  STICKEY  MUCH HAD TO BE SCRAPED OFF

Sticks on most fabrics and is just great overall.Got a nice clean look and had to minimal cleanup.Easy to cut,rip,and is great color.if my shoes are looking a lil dirty that’s just bc of me not using it well.Great purchase,just a little over priced and sometimes doesn’t stick easily.

For the money this product performs very well. It adheres to almost any surface, prevents bleed through with any latex paint and comes off clean so long as the paint is still tacky. For residential purposes Frog Tape is tough to beat, other brands I find don't adhere properly or tear upon removal.

It’s quality painters tape nothing industry changing but also not poor quality🤷🏼

But really that much money for something which will work.....Only buy when really need cause other colors not worth the money or time for us to redo the tape the next day....(blue tape)

Hubby is painting our basement. It's a big job, especially for one person. Count us in, for anything that makes it easier. This painter's tape prevents paint bleed & ensures clean lines.

I have two dozen Frogs taped to my White Vinyl Fence  this stuff has kept them there for months , I just have to water and feed them about twice a week and  drape a blanket over them in cold weather :)

This tape does leave very clean lines, and it worth the investment if you're super picky and want everything to be perfect.However, I'd suggest anything that's larger in width because this thin width just doesn't give enough "wiggle room" for someone, like myself, who is not a professional painter.I bought a few kinds of painters tape when repainting my entire house, and I ended up using the blue painters tape from Scotch, the thicker width, and it worked just fine.If money is no question, buy this in a wider width, but if you're looking for something more economical you can use the cheaper stuff and it'll look just fine.

This tape is great and served much more effective than the blue stuff, BUT, if you don't remove the tape when your paint is still wet, you either have to score all along the tape line or have big rips in your paint. Especially when using latex paint, as most people do.

This is the only tape I get for textured walls and surfaces. It sticks easily to difficult surfaces. Unfortunately, sometimes this excellent adhesion means that it takes some paint off with it.

I wanted something more leak proof for painting trim than the blue tape.  The green tape takes paint off!  And it does not adhere to stained wood.

Only works for latex paint. I guess I'm a doofus and didn't read the product clearly enough. The material reacts with latex paint to form a barrier. I thought I could use it to tape off stain areas for wood refinishing. Uhhhh no. It bleeds a lot. So if you were thinking as I was that you could use it for things other than paint that's a no.The start off is because I used it for its intended purpose as well and found I got better results with just using an angle brush. But I'm an artist so YMMV. If your hand is steady it might not be worth the bother.

I am a professional custom painter in SW Florida. We use Frog Tape almost daily.  Like any pro, I can cut a straight line.  But Frog Tape allows us to cut a PERFECTLY straight line with perfect crisp edges.  Frog Tape, like many others, is difficult to use in high humidity.  I gave this 4 stars not because the product itself is deficient, but because the canisters were all broken inside the box.  Also, since I've purchased, the price has been jacked up and I can get the same thing locally for less.

I am using this tape as freezer tape. It sticks to freezer paper really well, tears easily and is easy to use. A 100% improvement from the tape I was using. It has been in the freezer about a month and so far no issues.Will update after 6 months.

It's a nice hi quality tape, but no matter what, paint still bleeds through if you have any texture at all on your wall.

This was good tape but I don't think it is any different than Scotch blue tape.  I read all the suggestions - taped the area, ran over it with a butter knife, got it wet, ran it over with a butter knife again, waited a few days, painted a light coat, etc...and I STILL got lots of bleeding under the tape.  No clean line.  The reviews made me think this was a miracle product but unfortunately for me, it was not.  It worked just as good as Scotch blue tape, so I will give it a solid 4 stars.

Granted this is my fault for not knowing how wide .94” actually is, but all the pics of it being used are using the wider tape, which is what I was looking for. I’m sure I’ll use this eventually, so not worth returning it now. Check my pic compared to the pic they used of the guy pushing down on it. False ad. Please change for other dummies like me. Thanks.

Good product

This tape really works,  comes off easy blocks paint and is a lot better than all the other tapes I have used.

I expected it to release better than it did, but it pulled off the paint on the wall while removing the day after I painted. It also stuck to the molding and tore requiring me to use a dry wall knife to loosen it and pull the torn part free. Other wise it worked as expected and better than a lot of other masking tapes available.

it is tape and it worked

Overall, it’s a good painters tape if you need some. I like that this one is a bit wider than others I looked at (gives you a little more room for error when you’re painting).

Packaged well and received on time as described. I tried this with acrylic paints for artwork and found the paint did bleed a little on the taped line. I will experiment more, I may need to burnish  the more edge before painting or it could be due to the amount of acrylic paint used. I have not used this for interior painting yet.

I like the frog tape better than the blue painters tape.  The only thing I have noticed is in certain places that I left it on over a day the tape took little pieces of paint off.  I like that the paint does not bleed through on the edges like th blue tape does.  Less scraping and clean up.

Having been disappointed in the past with results from using the 'blue' tape, I decided to give this a whirl. Good decision. This product does a much better job at minimizing/eliminating situations where paint 'bleeds' under the tape.  Remember, this is a tool. Any tool will only perform if properly used.  So, take your time to ensure that you have it laid in a straight line and that the seam is properly pressed down on the existing surface. The results will actually be based on how well you do the prep work. Based on my experience, the only problems I had were due to the fact that I didn't have the tape either properly aligned or seated.  Those problems are minimal and will be quickly corrected. Tomorrow. (I took one star off because it is a tad pricey. . .)

So I gave it 4 stars because the paint did bleed through some. I wasn't planning on painting the ceiling but I am now. On the other hand it came off so much easier then the blue Scott tape. I dodnt need to fit to get it off.

It was good tape and i used for my canvas. it just has a smell to the tape. But it fulfilled the purpose.

It definitely sticks really well, and doesn't result in any paint bleeding. The only issue is that I was using it for cabinets and pocket doors, so it was wrapped around some edges and corners and it took forever to remove. It's so sticky that it tears rather than peeling off, especially when not stuck to a perfectly flat surface.

Goes on great. Creates smooth distinct lines, however be carefully on trim. It adheres quite well and can take some paint with it

The FrogTape for multi-surfaces works well.  Removal can be difficult at times.

Super strong tape.  Expensive.  One time use only.  Can pull paint off. Quite a few places pulled my pain off below it.

Works like a gem but container (meant to keep out dust was cracked :(.  Transferred rolls to a gallon ziplock bag to fix but wish the container had been intact instead.

...still less annoying than retouching every edge because you used cheap tape. Frog tape really does make a noticable different in preventing bleeding. However it still struggles when you are taping off textured walls. I'm not talking about popcorn ceilings or anything like that, just regular interior walls that have previously been painted with that "sandy" texturing. No matter what I do, touch-up is required. But I still feel like it works better than regular tape. And for smooth walls, wood trim, and everything else, it works 100% perfect at preventing bleeding.

Did not arrive next day as stated.  Tape works well a little better than the cheaper off brand blue tapes.

Didn’t not do well on steel door. Plastic window trim.

Whenever what is painted, it must be as good as possible and this tape is highly recommended for this type of work. I did not know that frogs could paint.

I used for spraying a few small items, works better than the blue stuff!

This is the best painters tape that I have ever used. The tape goes on smoothly and evenly. The lines from this tape are perfectly straight! I used this painters tape on my entire kitchen cabinets and on the walls and on the trim, and it worked wonderfully. I did not have any issues with this painters tape whatsoever. The tape went on easily, and it peeled off just as easily. I did not have any issues with the tape sticking to my cabinets or trim or walls after I had them painted, it was easy to remove the tape! The strength and stickiness of the tape is perfect, it sticks well, and then it peels off easily too. I am so happy with this product and I have continued using it for my next project which is painting my living room.  This is honestly the best painters tape that I had ever used, and I highly recommend it to others, as well as my family and friends. I hope this review has helped other people to decide on this product because it really is a wonderful product! And you do get quite a bit of tape with a single roll, which was another bonus to me!  "I'll post a few photos of my kitchen cabinets and walls that this product was used on." And I hope this helps!

Very good paint tape, which it should be given it's several times more expensive than the blue stuff.does good at stopping bleed and also removes easily, I had a project I painted and let sit for a year and it still came off without much fuss.. it's also good at using on surfaces that have been painted recently (like the day before)Although they have a yellow tape version that's even better at that job.A case of you get what you pay for.. it ain't cheap but it is good.

This does the trick when it comes to painting. Love it!!  No paint bleed through makes painting precisely accurate without the mistakes of other painters tape. 2 thumbs up!!

I am a resin artist and not all tape is the same even painters tape! I have found even with the heat and resin this tape secures wellTo my frames (canvas or wood) and comes off easily when finished. Other tapes would come loose with heat or the tape was difficult to remove. I recommend this green frog tape and is also comes in a variety of sizes. It is a great value for the price.

Tape does well when applied in small pieces at a time instead of a big long segment. Be sure  to burnish the edges with a your hand...I used an old credit card to prevent paint back bleed. The wide width was a good choice.Easy to remove. I waited a couple of days as I needed to apply a couple of paint coats. No issue. Came away easily.

This stuff is elite masking tape. Works perfectly every time.

I love this tape and it has nothing to do with painting. I’ve honestly never painted a wall before in my life. But this tape is great for all kinds of things, because it doesn’t leave a residue and is not super strong and sticky. My favorite uses are taping up rugs, making temporary labels and catching drywall dust while drilling.Just know that because it’s not very sticky, sometime it will peel up on things like plastic. This green brand is much better than the cheap blue stuff. You need this in your home trust me.

Follow the instructions to wipe the edges with a damp rag (use some pressure) before applying paint.  It left clean lines even on my orange peel textured walls.  Never going back to the blue stuff.

Easy to write on, rip, apply, and take down. Bought this tape because I love the color and needed to label moving boxes. It's the perfect width for one big line or two easy-to-read lines of handwriting. The move is complete but I'm using the tape for casual everyday labeling- bags of fruit in the freezer, school lunch items, donations to the thrift store, and everything else. Will keep Frog Tape on hand at all times!

This product is better than the regular blue tape for painting it sticks better peels off better and seems more watertight. Highly recommended.

The tape holds together better than the blue tape when removing after painting.

That’s kind of a scary thought but honestly, one of the most annoying thing about painting is when you come across a product that either doesn’t work or is so bad at its job that you wish you hadn’t bought it in the first place. This tape goes on easy—if I accidentally got some on the plastic too early or in the wrong spot or on my sleeve, it easily came off—and then when I applied it to the appropriate surface and gave it one smooth roll-over with either the tape roll, a painter’s tool, or my hand, the tape held itself and the plastic wrap in place. I am very impressed. I thought installing the window covers to paint out sliding doors that are maybe 12 feet long would be a nightmare and I had visions of it constantly tearing under the weight of the plastic during installation (because there wouldn’t be 12 feet of tape in place initially supporting all of the weight) but I had literally no issue and I’m so pleased. It worked to hold the cover, it worked to seal out unfinished outlets and protect the wiring capped in place while also being easy to remove. My only recommendation is to not go  overboard with your application of it and don’t press it too hard into your wall (especially if it’s drywall). In the first room, having never painted before I may have not trusted the tape to work and added too much and pressed it too hard into the dry wall which resulted in peeling off some of the surface when done, which was easily spackled but that took additional time. After that room, we had no issues and felt like seasoned pros with the help of the tape. Thank you!

I have used multiple versions of painters tape. I have been let down many times and will never go back to the others.  Always use this one from now on out!!

If you haven’t used Frog Tape yet. Get some!!! That is all!!!! 😎😎😎😎😎

Hanging posters and signs in my classroom is a breeze with this tape. I don't buy any other kind.

Frog Tape is the only tape I’ll use for painting projects. It’s the best of the best. Leaves no residue and seals great to every surface I’ve used it on. It’s not a tape that’s going to tear if you pull on it too hard, it’s very durable.

Used to paint half my wall. No bleed through

Frog tape is by far better than the traditional blue tape.  I’ll use frog tape from now on

We recently repainted several walls in our house and this tape was much sturdier than the blue stuff. It made nice clean lines and was easy to apply and take off.

Excellent product, and I was glad to learn it's not made from frogs!

I should’ve taken photos of this tape job vs the blue painter’s tape.I was painting a curved edge, rough in some spots, and my previous tape couldn’t handle it. I struggled.I had to find something different. This tape saved my soul.

Best tape for painting.

Cost more but less clean up..

Thick tape, that doesn’t stick. Well, sometimes, but it’s still better than all others

I always, ALWAYS use frog tape. Nothing compares. It is at least 50% more at the hardware store or big box home improvement stores. Sorry but when you pay a million dollars for paint and supplies you have to try and save money somewhere and I won’t do it by purchasing off brand tape. Easy to put on and take off sometimes I reuse it around the room too. Super durable and doesn’t rip off drywall.

Won’t use anything other than this product

Makes clean lines, goes on easy, peels off easy, it's what I wish that blue painter's tape was.

i saw this used on a reel, decided to try it.  i've used the blue painters tape for years and constantly have to deal with bleed through by the paint.  this tape, eliminated that issue!  clean lines.  easy to remove, doesn't rip apart like the blue crap.  doesn't bleed through like the blue crap.  well worth the extra money!!!

For a messy painter like me, I have learned that prep is 75% of the job! This tape saved me so much clean up! Get the extra wide - if you spend the time and money taping, it almost  doubles your protection exactly where you need it

Frog tape is my go to not only for painting, but also for marking items. The tape sticks well and can be removed easily without having residue left. The size of the tape is Just right. Durability and ease of writing on it make it the best I have ever used.

This product was recommended for stencil painting and I have used it for that and much more. It sticks so well and comes off nicely without leaving any residue. It is thick and durable and helps reduce paint bleeding.

I use a lot of the blue tape for my day to day work. But this frog tape is the only thing I use for painting. It has the least amount of leakage and comes off baseboards/trim without tearing or leaving behind residue after a couple coats.

Usually I use Frog Tape yellow (less adhesion for more delicate surfaces) but when I need a really clean edge on a surface that I don’t need to worry about peeling I go for the green.

We do a lot of hobby painting and Frog tape is the Best of the Best.  This is our go to tape for no bleeding and fine detailing work.  The other brands just don't perform like the Frog

What I love about Frog tape is simply that if I use it to pack things away for a time on say bubble wrap or cardboard boxes I can take the tape off easily 98% of the time. This tape can stay on a wall for months for painting an area and come o.ff easily. Thos tape is strong but removes easily. You can put this tape on just about anything and it will not hurt your walls it won't leave any residue on anything. This is my all time favorite tape. It even comes off easily from picture packages too. I would use duct tape if I had to absolutely had to if something was extremely heavy. Frog tape is my all around tape it rips easily too. I can take a piece and rip it down the middle if I need smaller pieces. It's the best tape to use on everything if you want easy removal of the tape to reuse your packaging.

I prefer this over the blue tape. Works better

The tape did very well taping of my tank of motorcycle and fenders kept lines very very crisp. After 2 hrs removed tape that had been there about a month came off clean with no extra adhesion!! Great product will definitely buy again!!

I consider myself a better than average painter and trim lines that are not perfect drive me crazy. I've tried every trim / edging device out there and nothing works as well as this. The key is how you apply. It adheres better than blue tape and it can pull off one-coat semi-gloss or any thick paint that hasn't set for at least 24 hours. So wait a bit if applying it to recently painted surfaces.  I use the 2" wide tape.  Cleaning the surface prior to taping is a must. I actually hit with a fine grit of sandpaper to knock off any rough spots, then get the dust off with a damp rag. After it dries, tape it. Rip off about 2 1/2' - 3' strips and place it in the center/edge of the corner or edge. Align it then lightly tap it in place so it sticks every 6" or so.  You can adjust it as you go.  Once you have your line acceptable, use your finger or thumb to run over the taped edge just where it meets the corner several times. I can't stress that enough. I only afix about 1/2" of the width of the tape Don't worry about the rest, it'll act as a shield. Repeat until entire trim / edge is done. I done it this way on many surfaces. This preparation method may take longer than others, but when you peel the tape off, it'll impress you.  I've painted with a paint brush and roller running parallel with and on the the tape.  I've started on the tape brushing perpendicular away from the edge. No bleed. I also wait only about 5 minutes after painting to remove the tape. Pull it away at a 45-60 degree angle from the painted surface. Use a 3" wide putty knife to tuck it under the edge of the floor trim taping it to the carpet or any floor. You have room. Also you can use a 2" putty knife to push it into seams between trim and wall.  I just painted 4 walls of a 16' by 26' family room taping off floor trim, 6 windows and doors and ceiling.  It took me 90 minutes to tape it and 90 to paint it.  I've painted over 35 years and this will save you time, money and the frustration of using an artist fine tip brush to touch up those places only I'm the only one who'd ever notice anyway.  Yeah, I've done that, but never again!  Frog Tape has made my painting experience a lot more fun and looks absolutely perfect.  I'll never paint without it again, ever.

I love this tape. It works great for its purpose for paint, but I also use it for labeling anything in the house, kids arts and crafts so as not to leave a mess, and for just everything else. It is my favorite tape.

This is a great painters tape, and it comes off easily. Since I discovered it, I've probably bought 10+ rolls, and won't be going back. Compared to the generic blue painters tape, this is better at preventing bleeding paint. Remember to always create a tab on one end to make it easy to peel off (fold the extra tape over onto itself)I've never had an issue with leftover adhesive after a short use on walls, but there is a yellow lower-tack version for if you need to leave it on for a long time (like mounting artwork) or are working with a delicate surface (like wallpaper).I mostly use painters tape for labeling boxes so that I can easily take the labels off and re-use them. I like that frog tape uses lighter colored tape colors, as opposed to the typical darker blue. It's easier to read the labels.NOTE FOR ARTISTS:If you're trying to use a painters tape for artwork on delicate papers (e.g., watercolor paper), you should instead use a low tack artist tape. This is just the wrong kind of tape. If you're painting on a sturdy surface like canvas, I would still recommend using the (yellow) low tack version of the frog tape.

The best painters tape I've ever used!!!

This is priceless when lines need to be perfect.  This is 7 coats strong.

My husband and I used a whole roll of this tape while we were repainting our baseboards. I'm not the greatest painter but fortunately with this tape I don't need to be. Nothing bled through. Definitely will repurchase again.

What can I say?  This is the influence of Chef Carmy from The Bear, for me to feel like a Michelin Star chef while meal prepping on Sundays.

this tape works for all surfaces!

I received this in one day.  Worked great for my project.

Used it for painting my model car bodies and it holds really well really crisp lines. If I need more in the future I will only go with this brand.

I bought this tape to use on paintings on paper to tape to mat board.  I press firm on both edges of art work and the mat board.  By overnight, the painting falls out of the mat board.  There is virtually NO adhesion.You can't use this for anything.  If you put it on a wall for around the trim doe painting and press firm, it still falls to the ground.  Back to 3M Blue tape.  This product should be taken off the market.

The previous owners of my house varnished the wood trim so I wanted to be very careful when taping it off to paint the walls. So, I bought the tape for delicate surfaces. Well, I don't know what FrogTape's standard for "delicate" is but it pulled off chunks of the varnish (after only being on the surface for about 4 hours) and now I'm having to sand and paint the wood trim.I highly recommend testing this tape in an inconspicuous location and leaving it for 24 hours as a test BEFORE you tape off to start painting.

I bought the Frog Delicate surface painting tape after much research and reviews on amazon and google research.  After cleaning my trim thoroughly, drying, and taping the entire bedroom's trim, I stood back to proudly look at my hours of work.  To my dismay, the tape was peeling up from the top of the trim.  I thought I missed some spots or didn't push it hard enough, so I went back and started pressing it down again.  Halfway through the room, I looked back, and within 10 minutes time, it was peeling again.  I was so mad.  I decided to try the green tape, and low and behold, it stayed.  Checked it again in the morning, and it was still okay.  Wasted $9 and hours of work.  Please save yourself the disappointment and go with the green.  Am returning the other 4 rolls that I bought.  Wish I could get a refund for the 1 roll that I already used taping the whole room in vain.

I was hoping this would be a gentle tape, but unfortunately it pulled some paint off our walls in multiple locations. It's too bad.  We had high hopes.

I bought this to edge out pieces of a frame I was working on, counting heavily on it's promise to deliver cut/clean/sharp edges, but it won't stick - at all.  It just kept peeling back up.  Tried more, same result, even more, same result.  So, I got out my 3m blue, which worked like a champ on the exact same piece, in the exact same spots.  Blue held true until I wanted to take it off, and it didn't damage anything it'd been stuck to.  So, I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch more 3m blue in diff sizes.

This just falls off the wall. You can’t even paint without it starting to peel off.

I have used Frog Tape for many years. This roll was junk, oxidized, heat damaged, the adhesive liquified off of the tape. 100% loss for me!Check yours when it arrives so you can get an adjustment from A->Z.

This literally has to be the worst paint tape I have ever used! You might as well buy 99 cent tape from the dollar store! Absolute garbage for a $20 roll of tape! They should call it GARBAGE TAPE! Because that's exactly what it's worthy!

Applied this around door frames so I was able to paint the frames. When I removed it the paint peeled off right with it.  Now I have to go around and try to repaint those spots without getting the paint on the walls.

Like most expensive tapes that claim to be the answer this  tape peels the paint right off.  Whether the paint is fresh, cured, mid grade, or high end, this tape simply does not do it’s job.  It is not worth the time to tape trim it falls right off. As far as taping walls and ceilings, you end up spending more time touching up where it leaks or peels than if you were to just cut in. Waste of time and money.

Do not use this for artwork, unless you want to be frustrated and disappointed. Not sure about other mediums but for gold standard oil painting the tape isn't strong enough to hold a barrier to create the clean crisp edge you're looking for.. Did a few experiments....used thinned out oil paint with solvent and it loosened the tape right off the paper. Impasto was OK but any vigorous movement around the tape edges seem to move the tape. Even blue artist tape works better.

I recently bought a new condo and wanted to paint everything... ceiling, walls, some floors... etc.  I was really excited after I read an article in Consumer Reports that rated this tape so highly.  Needless to say, my experience was not favorable.  I couldn't get this tape to stick long enough to get a strip of paint on the wall before it would start peeling away from the wall and/or just lifting a little bit of of the surface so when you paint it, it causes paint to go where you don't want it to.  I am highly disappointed... ended up throwing a few rolls away and went and another leading brand's blue tape.

This tape was really easy to remove, it hardly stuck at all! We are painting our entire house and wanted to use this on the Delicate Surfaces, and we really like the green frog tape so we decided to use the yellow. We ended up returning this tape and getting the green tape anyways. Maybe we got a weird package, but we will just stick to the green frog tape from here on out. Hopefully we wont have to paint again anytime soon;)

Outrageously expensive. It claims it doesn’t damage your surface, but it does. It pulled off paint in several places. There are better alternatives. Cannot recommend this.

Too sticky. This product is overrated, I should've stayed with the 3M product.The paint I was protecting was 3 days old.The tape sat for less than 30 hours on it, then it came off with the paint.It also peeled the paint off the door trims I was masking. This paint was 7 years old!!!I need to paint all around the ceiling border again and use a regular brush.Waste of time and money.Stay away!

I rarely write reviews on products, but this one was a huge disappointment. I specifically bought this tape to use on our trim. The trim was painted an entire week prior to using the tape. When we peeled the tape off as directed, it peeled paint from the trim with it. It also caused some of the wall paint to peel as well. Additionally, the tape did not stick well to some of our surfaces.

I usually just cut in with a slender brush when painting.I’m actually quite good at it. This time I thought I’d use the tape so the job would go more quickly as I had read so many good reviews about this state. Save your money, save your time. It’s just as bad as all the rest.

I applied this tape for a painting project.  When I removed it, it left a sticky residue. Now I'm going to have to use a solvent to remove the stickiness which will likely screw up the paint job I was hoping to keep neat.  I've already thrown what was left of  the roll in the garbage.

I purchased this tape because of so many positive reviews on Amazon as well as ads I've seen on TV. We used it exactly as prescribed, waiting the required amounts of time, and there was lots of paint bleeding, really just as much as with some old blue painter's tape that we used before we purchased Frogtape Delicate Surface. Now there is a lot of touch-up work to do, and I hope the job will look acceptable when we are all finished. This is one of the most disappointing products I have ever purchased!

I bought this to use as masking for watercolor painting. Big mistake. I taped the edges of my Stonehenge hot press watercolor paper and had it on less than 24 hrs. When I peeled it off, it ripped a layer off of my papers edge and also ripped into the painted area too. I guess they don't consider watercolor paper a "delicate surface".

This company should be sued for false advertising. I painted my trip and waited FOUR DAYS before taping it with this "sensitive" tape, which claims to work well with freshly painted tape--up to 24 hours, it says. When I peeled the tape off, it peeled off HUGE swaths of paint from my trim everywhere, basically requiring that I do the entire job all over again. It's infuriating that companies like this get away with selling lies.Their green tape is also useless.

Paid extra for the frog tape. Was always a 3m blue guy. Edges aren't any better, even when following directions. If you're looking to spend more for what 3m does already frog tape is your brand.

I finally used this tape.  It is terrible.  The paint bled through.  When I removed it, it tore off the paint it was taped to!  I was greatly disappointed.  It was not worth the time or trouble it took to put it on.  Will not be using it again.

It doesn't stick to surfaces for more than a few seconds

Do not leave this tape adhered to any surface for very long.  It will become stuck like duct tape!A painter told me they will never use it because of this issue.  Only uses blue tape and never had issues.Be careful.

Used this to create sharp edges between the ceiling and wall, however when I started removing the tape the ceiling paint was peeling off with the tape. The ceiling was painted a week before the tape was applied.

Delicate it was notPulled up poly finish on floorsThanks for nothing.

Didn’t try it with anything else but for Art straight lines it quite terrible.

I purchased this solely due to the package advertising "paint block technology" that would work better than a less expensive brand.  Well it did not.  As you can see from the pictures, it left bleeds and the lines were not consistently clean. Very disappointed that  the tape for me did not work as advertised.

Pictures speak 1000 words.

This tape is very good for use on art or on any project where you do not want to damage the underlying surface.I ran a test with this tape to evaluate its use; for the first test I taped a surface and immediately painted over it, for the 2nd test I applied the tape and left it for 1 hour undisturbed before painting over it. I noticed that for the first test, there was some bleed through onto the surface although surprisingly little. The 2nd test presented a nice crisp line with very little bleed through.I am very satisfied with this product and give it 5 stars.

I love working with FROGTAPE. It works so well, but better than the regular blue painting tape. Nothing runs or gets through this tape.

When getting ready to do a big paint project I did some price checking and found these to be a much better price than local big box stores. The yellow tape is for delicate surfaces and it has just the right amount of adhesion. It lasted through the project and came off easily. It is easy to apply although sometimes I wish it came with an applicator like packing tape.

Hubby learned to paint interiors from a professional house painter, so, over the decades, we have painted our houses (only two) ourselves, except once when he was ill. (THAT "professional" was terrible.)  My point is that we know a lot about painting the inside of a house.Hubby has used many different types of tape in his painting tasks, and this tape is the only tape he will use.  The lines are sharp, and there is no bleeding if you apply it correctly.  Our last painting task was a closet interior, and he taped the laminate floor inside the closet to protect it from the paint, and there is not a drop of paint anywhere!I cannot recommend this tape strongly enough.  If you care about ease of use, sharp lines, no bleeding, and not damaging painted surfaces, this is the tape you need.And....I used a few pieces to hold some thin contact paper together to match the patterns before applying the paper, and when I peeled the tape off, there was no damage to the contact paper, and no adhesive residue left behind.We used to use the blue painter's tape for years, but now, this is the only tape we will use.

I used the tape in a class to make Barn Quilts, which are metal signs with quilt blocks painted on them. The paint worked great. My only complaint is the plastic container that holds the tape arrived cracked.

this was much wider than I anticipated (should have checked the size before ordering) it works well for paper crafts as it will lift off without damaging the paper. similar tapes are made for the crafting community but I couldn't see spending the price. though this is a bit expensive, it is far cheaper than the products made for the crafting community. given the width of the tape, I will probably use it for taping down water color paper. would also be great for wood crafts where the wood is prone to splinter when using other tapes and for painted surfaces as the adhesion is good enough to make a strong bond to limit bleed through but not so strong as to pull up paint or bits of wood.

We're rushing to get the paint done in a small remodel and didn't have much time for the trim to cure before doing the walls. I purchased this delicate surface tape and we painted walls just three days after the trim. Left the tape on and did a second coat a day later. It removed like a dream. Didn't pull any paint off and created the crispest line I've ever done with zero bleed. Definitely awesome tape!

Also used it to tape paper floor covering without damaging freshly stained wood floor

Easy to use

I used this tape to paint my kitchen cabinets and it worked really good, easy to use, and yeah as it shows on the description it’s better to use for delicate surfaces

I only review products that I'm extremely impressed with or disappointed with. I used this for some trim work on crown molding and I should have just did the work by hand because the amount of time wasted taping could have been used on something else. Since the tape was on a deal, I'm assuming it was old and why its adhesive failed and bled paint onto my white gloss. That's the last time I use tape for brushing or rolling.

Adhesion is extreme it removed the new paint under the tape , and there is no  difference between the regular blue tape and this.. There were no straight lines when I removed it.And i got my tape box open and it looks like it was used.

Don’t waste your money. Either this isn’t the real thing or I got a bad batch.

This says it can be used on wallpaper but didn’t work for us.  Luckily we tested on some scrap before ruining our paper

Researched tape looking for one that would not leave residue behind for a craft project using rocks. Thought this would be the answer. Not so. It left residue after a day of use. Will not purchase again for my particular needs.

Was written that it was easy on paint and not to lift it off. Ripped my paint right off! So pissed! Had to sand and repaint!

I expected a name brand like frogtape to do what it says it will, namely, keep paint out. How is it supposed to do that if it won't stick to the darn surface? It popped right off the surface (painted canvas) so fast, I couldn't believe that it has four stars, and so many glowing reviews. It didnt stick for a minute. back to the drawing board, next time trying another brand.

Does not stay well on textured!!!

Doesn’t secure paint from going under tape

Unfortunately, the ad does not say this tape is for latex only.  The tape itself says it, which I noticed only after using this with oil base and crazing the surface of my article.  The 3M sensitive surface tape does not do this as long as you remove it fairly promptly.

I'm having a difficult time accepting the fact that both rolls are actually 60 yards...one roll is smaller/less tape than the other...and both are smaller/less tape on the roll that the Frogtape Multi-Surface (1.88in x 60yd)--green colored tape.... picture attached...

I did not like the fact that my frog tape had been opened and some of it used.. when I received it...

this stuff didnt stick very well to the baseboards in my house, and as a result, there was paint all over the baseboards...more needless work.  Also, before I started painting, I had to make sure that I went over all of the tape before painting because it just wasnt sticky enough.  I should have just gone with 3M blue stuff...

I know it's for delicate surfaces, but I was using it for paper and was disappointed in its holding power.  I think the green frog tape would have been better for my purposes.

While this tape does a good job sealing out the paint and producing sharp lines, it pulls the paint off.  Very disappointing.

This (the yellow Frog Tape) tape sucks.  Get the GREEN Frog Tape -- it's much better.  This tape rips while you are trying to apply it or even get it off the roll.

Wasn't any different that regular blue tape.

The green tape is waaaaaaay better at keeping its edges sealed against bleeding.

I'm super disappointed in this tape. I usually use this to hold down my watercolor paper and I have no issues with it tearing my paper when I pull it off. However, for home interior paint use, I hate it. I usually don't use tape, but I wanted crisp lines between my grey wall paint and my white casing. This tape is supposed to be for paint that's at least 24 hours old. I painted my casing about 2 weeks ago. I applied the tape to my casing and it was only on there for about 30 minutes. I cut in my wall color, fan dried it, cut in again and immediately pulled the tape off of my casing. While I did get a nice crisp line, the tape pulled my two week old paint off of my casing. I figured with it being so gentle on watercolor paper, the same would apply to my home paint projects. I was sadly mistaken. With painters tape usually running around $10 a roll, I don't care to continuously test brands that only end in failure and disappointment. I'll stick to a steady hand.

Perhaps I was simply getting poor adhesion (though I don't see why), but this tape does tend to pull some paint off of the surface when removed. Since it's supposed to be delicate, what's the point?

We had a vinyl French door installed and the wood trim did not match the white vinyl.  Our dining room wallpaper was 40+ years old and in good condition having a print pattern with a somewhat delicate metallic silver background.  I thought the delicate form of yellow Frog tape would be ideal.  It seemed stickier than the Frog green tape or the blue tape.  Anyway, after applying the tape I found that it peeled the printed and metallic background off the wallpaper base wrecking the wallpaper.  Now I will have to cover the taped areas with a vinyl strip to cover the destruction.  We found the best method to remove the tape was with a generously wetted cloth and a dabbing motion as the tape was removed back upon itself.  Nevertheless, when the paper starts to tear, it continues to tear.

I paid extra to get this yellow tape to prevent paint from being pulled off my door after I taped off the glass parts, the door handles, etc.  I applied the tape to the door,  making sure the edges tightly adhered to the edge of the handle plate, the glass upper window, the hinges, the weatherstripping along the bottom of the door etc, and painted away. The next day I applied a second coat to the door, then began to remove the tape before the paint was completely dry. The paint came off the door with the tape in big chunks. I was totally disgusted, to say the least. Either I did something wrong in the process, which I don't think was the case, or this product just doesn't work any better than the green or blue varieties of this same tape. This yellow version was not worth the extra cost in my opinion...not at all.

I was hoping for something, a little thicker and more like automobile, painting, trim tape… This was thin in the same consistency as the green tape that we’re familiar with. Maybe I should’ve known ahead of time but I was hoping for something different. Hello Marcus only because of my expectations… The product itself is the same as the green tape only it’s yellow.

I use painters tape in place of drafting tape for my art work.  I used to use  Duck Brand purple painters tape but they no longer make it so I am looking for a replacement. I bought this delicate surface Frog tape and another brand of purple tape. The other brand of purple tape worked better for my use . I don't know how this would work for household  paintingThis yellow Frog tape is  stickier than I expected for delicate surface tape. If you plan to use it  against wall paper I would suggest trying it on an inconspicuous place first .

Putting tape up and having more than half fall off before finishing painting. The green was way better.?

Try it for yourself. Might like it

I purchased this item after reading the reviews, I was looking for a tape to paint leather that wouldn't destroy the surface.  I was excited and bought two rolls.  This delicate version, does not stay stuck on leather.  I know it's for painting walls, but it was suggested to try for painting on leather.  It's a bit too delicate i think, and paints bled underneath the tape.

While I love the green Frog tape on canvas, the yellow tape starts to peel off before I finish mixing the colors.

Love the green Frogtape, but not so impressed with yellow. Used it to protect adjoining new paint And also grout next to baseboards- got bleed-under in both cases, especially the grout.

Maybe this is better for wallpaper or glass but for typical trim work and wall coverage it does not adhere very well.

From the reviews, I thought this stuff was really good. But I used it along a 5' section of ceiling that had been painted for 48 hours and was totally dry. It still peeled sections off and I had to go back and spackle and repaint. In my opinion, it's really no different than regular masking tape.

I used this to protect some wallpaper edges, having had bad experiences with the blue version of this tape.  When I carefully pulled it back, it still managed to peel away some surface paper areas, in one case in an awkward spot where I will have to haul in a tall ladder.So...it's not as bad as the blue...but not great.

The paint still bleeds.  At least it doesn't pull the old paint off "as much" as the blue frog tape

I've had great experience with their green tape but had a need to use this stuff over a fairly new day old painted surface.  Unlike the green tape, adhesion was not always adequate, sometimes allowing tape to seep under the tape line.  This tape also stretches more than the green variety which sometimes makes it more difficult to achieve a straight line.

It says that it is 60 yd roll but i bought 7 and none of them were 60yd. The case says 60 yd but the roll when i put it besides a green 60yd you will see it is not 60. Other than that, great product

I was using this to trim the room and door - I couldn't tell a difference.  I got the delicate surface but it still pulled up the paint off the door - I was trying to paint a metal door so it could be me...

I did not realize that there were several different tapes with different adhesion levels.

This tape doesn’t have the stick to make sure the paint doesn’t run under. I was disappointed in its performance

This works well for clean lines. Unfortunately it did peel off paint that was already on the wall :(

Paid more, but I wasn't impressed.

This tape makes a good, sharp paint line, but I still had problems with it removing the underlying paint (in some situations where adhesion was questionable). Be sure to let new paint dry 24 hours before applying tape and then remove the tape as soon as possible - follow the instructions for use!

Maybe we left it on for too long or maybe our paint was old - but our paint did chip off when using this.  My husband decided to get the best lines on the edges a good angled paint brush and a steady hand works best!

Easy use, but would not hold paper when wet. When applied to dry paper, the tape would rip the paper when removed.

We painted the trim, waited 24 hrs, then taped the trim to paint the walls.  The tape did not take the paint off the trim, but it did have some minor paint bleeds.

It's fine.  Over priced, but fine.

Was disappointed that paint bleed through taoe

its tape, nothing more and nothing special

didn't see a difference in pulling it up than regular frog tape in term of delicates - is much thinner though

Not any better than the halfway decent priced blue stuff (which I think is still overpriced)

Thin

Was not 100% effective

Went to three stores to find it (and paid $7.99) but it will not stay on my textured walls more than 5 minutes without lifting off.  They are new construction sheetrock with a coat of primer and then SW Duration Satin which is really thick and not yet cured (about a week).  Building a new house so have been trying to keep plastic wall corner protectors (8 feet) on without using the permanent tape they come with).  Started with 3Ms "best" blue paint but it starts to come off after a couple of days would occasionally pull off small specs of paint.  Maybe it would work better on curred walls (though its made esp for walls painted just 24 hours ago) or on non-textured sheetrock.  So went back to store and bought the Frog green for first time which sticks really well.  Just hope the wall does not come with it! Updated 5-18-12; perhaps should have mentioned I have 5/8 inch sheet rock while almost all houses have been built with 1/2 for years (since plaster:) an I should have mentioned I LOVE GREEN FROG TAPE - its everything yellow is not.

Bought this specifically because it said it was for delicate surfaces. However when removing tape it lifted the paint from the delicate surface.

This is much stickier than the 3M brand equivalent. Would not recommend for new paint.

Works just as well as the green for painting but doesn't stick as well to the wall

ok but does not do any better job than other makes which are cheaper

Does as described

I expected this tape to be very similar to blue tape but it’s much thinner and doesn’t seem to stick to itself as well. I HAVE NOT used it for painting-just for crafting, so I can’t speak to how well it works for that.

This tape works fine in that it does not take fresh paint off the wall if allowed to dry overnight. I am not a believer in the paintblock tech as it is hit or miss for me. I find if I don't knife at the tape seam paint will come up when removing the frogtape but on the other hand rarely do I get bleed under the tape. Also when tearing this tape off the roll it will always rip at some obtuse angle wasting 6" of tape unless you tear it carefully with that in mind. I could do without the plastic case in lieu of a better price also.

I bought this after watching multiple videos of people painting straight lines. I decided after painting my room half and half mint and grey that a nice white strip would look nice to separate the colors. So I needed a tape to make a nice straight line. After waiting for my paint to dry and for the product to arrive ~30 hrs, I applied the tape to my walls. Easy to use! Adheres nicely, just make sure to really stick it to your wall. But after I painted the line and waited until the next morning to remove, the paint did take off the other wall colors I had recently painted. Though, it was an easy fix. Overall, good product!

Works as advertised, no bleeding and sharp edges!

I thought this tape would be a little stronger. It’s suppose to be 48mm but doesn’t seem so compared to the 3mm. This tape tears to easy.I just wanted something strong to hold things together but easy to remove.

I think it was my own mistake to order tape for "delicate surfaces." I'm sure it would be good for that purpose, but for general use you'll probably find this tape is not quite tacky enough to stay in place without a lot of tedious, careful pressing.I'd limit the use of this tape to truly delicate surfaces where you can take the time to press it thoroughly into place.

Only use this when it is critical that the surface to which it is applied must not be damaged.  You will find yourself repeatedly pressing down on the edges to get it to stick (depending on the surface).  Next time I will use the regular blue tape and be extra careful with critical projects.

Well it does what it says it stops paint. Now this stuff is stickier than the Blue rhino table I got paint I got I absolutely no problem with the blue rhino. The Blue rhino is less sticky than the frog tape. Frog tape needs more stickier and can peel up you know the underneath coat. Or the top layer of the drywall. Babe says that is also easy to pull off nah I don't think so.

I work with a lot of resin and usually use the green Frog tape. I got this one by accident. I can see how this would be useful for some things, but for resin it's probably better to stick with the green. Because this one is so thin, the resin ran through the tape, also the tear away was not as seamless.On the positive side, this tape was thin, sticks well to the surface and very easy to remove, it also did not leave any sticky residue.

Ok

I bought this tape because I was painting an entire room, ceiling, trim and walls. It definitely didn’t take any of the new paint off which was great. The trouble I had was I wanted to tape off all the trim at once and by the time I got all the way around the room, the tape had begun to unstick where I first started. I had to press everything down a second time right before painting, which was a pain. I also used this to tape off an accent wall and it worked perfectly for that.

Adhered pretty well to previously painted surfaces without causing damaging. A little bleed through in a few select spots.

Excellent product…wider than I needed and drew up some of the surface of the heavy art paper…so I felt I wasted almost half the width.Have changed from acrylics to water soluble oil paints and oil canvas paper.  Have not tried it on this surface yet.

I use this for edging my watercolor paper so there is a nice crisp edge when painting is complete and I pull it off.  Ihavent has any problems with it in that way. I did discover that when I changed my mind about the lastpainting and wanted to add something to the near edge i had a little problem.  I put new tape around the edge of thepainting on the same edges as before.  The yellow tape will not stay putonce I took it off. Even fresh tape peels off.I recommend this for delicate projects and press hard to make sure the tape is adhering the way you want it.I will always use this tape in the future for watercolors but I will be careful about thinking I can change my mindand reapply the edging.

I use this tape for labeling more than I use it for an actual painters tape, so this review may or may not apply to youIt is more see-through than other similar tapes I've used in the past.  I haven't had any issues with bleed through, but compared to their green tape or other painters tapes there is definitely a thickness concernRemoves from surfaces very well, but also sticks well until you try to peel it off.Overall quite happy with it

I got so tired of using the paint tape that ends up pulling off a bunch of the paint I just did. This seems to be much better. It tore some of the paint but not too much. Easier to remove. Worked so much better!

The green frog tape is a better product.

Works well, and leaves a clean edge like advertised. I gave it 4 stars because when peeling it off, it has a tendency to rip along the line where you got paint on it and where it is clean, leaving you picking pieces of painted tape off the surface, trying to find a spot lift an edge and pull the rest off. The adhesive lets go easily, leaves no residue fine, and conforms to odd shapes very well, but the sacrifice is a tape that isn't very sturdy to pull off.

I tried this tape when painting a room in stripes, that is, in contrasting colors of blue with six-inch-wide stripes. Thus a lot of taping was involved. The yellow Frog Tape worked well--no bleeding. However to make the tape work well you need to really press it down firmly on the wall--going over it with a putty knife is effective. Then as soon as you finish painting next to that line of tape, pull It up--DON'T wait for the paint to dry. And don't use this tape on a textured or papered wall. Some of the complaints I've seen about this tape are because the reviewers haven't used the tape right. Go to Frog's website for tips and instruction.

Tape works great! I love how thin it is, paint DOES NOT seep through, however the tape does leave a bit of residue. I only know this because I am airbrushing a very smooth surface and the paint particles stick to the residue from the previous mask. Nothing an alcohol wipe cant fix, but its just another step in the process (I am doing A LOT of airbrushing).

This tape is easier to mask off painted areas. I prefer it to the typical painters tape. It blocks paint seepmthrough  better than all other  tapes I have used , but it can still pull off paint that it is contacting so be careful. It is my go to tape for painting.

I gently [pulled on the tape off of a photo and it tore the top layer of the photo off.  I will be more careful?

Works about as good as standard painters tape, but maybe a little better. If your lines aren't perfectly straight you still run the risk of paint getting under the tape. Still, it's good painters tape that pulls clean.

I've read good and bad reviews on this product.  I have not used it as of yet, but I will let you know how it does as my project requires a lot of painting. I gave it a 4 because it's tape!

Very good especially painting stripes. This is the first time I paint stripes, i used this tapes, and it didn't 'bleed' at all. My friends are very impressed!

It is what it says it is, while the quality of blue tape - by all manufacturers - has gone way down hill over the years.

Recently Consumer Reports tested a number of tapes like this. They said the yellow 'Delicate Surface' tape was best. Most pros don't use tape or other aids-just use a steady hand.

Paint did seep in :/

Just love Frog Tape! We use it for everything!

Good painters tape works well

Good tape. HORRIBLE packaging.

Works great for masking off trim and walls when using a spray rig.

thank you

Better than the regular tape but i still had some bleeding paint here and there. Super easy to take off and didn't crack the paint.

Great product.

WORKS GREAT !

Reliable as always.

Frog Tape works well; preferred over the "blue" brand.

nice

We used this to protect our walls (and then our trim) when painting. We picked what was supposed to be the less sticky version. The tape protected well from bleeding but still pulled up three coats of urethane trim paint (plus primer) from random spots on our trim (which was originally painted with an oil paint). Disappointing that we had to repaint these areas.

If you want a razor crisp edge, paint your base color over the edge of you tape first and let dry before painting your 2nd color.  My photos show the difference of not doing this and then sealing for the edge bleed.  Frog tape works better than 3M blue painters tape but not as well as they claim in their staged ads.  I used a scraper edge to really flatten down the frog tape, but . . . .

This is definitely less tacky than the green tape. It can still peel paint off if left on for too long. Otherwise, it is definitely more delicate than the green/blue tapes. It did what I needed.

Was it supposed to look like this?I hope this isn’t a use one.

I bought this to tape watercolour paper to a board and for this use it's pretty much perfect.  It sticks well but removes very easily and cleanly when the masterpiece (or very much not in my case) is completed, so there's a nice clean edge to the painting and no buckling of the paper, since it's been stretched by the tape.My one criticism, and the reason for removing a star, is that often the tape doesn't tear cleanly across.  Admittedly I use my teeth to tear it, since using scissors or a knife would require a third hand, but I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  When the tear-with-the-teeth method is used, the torn end often frays/breaks by up to an inch or so.  It doesn't matter greatly to me but does lead to some wastage of the tape.

No blowouts and seeping paint when I used paint sprayer - it was a perfectly crisp line. However, when I used rollers, I had to go touch up a number of places afterwards.

tape worked ok, there was some areas that paint seeped out.

Left nice crisp lines. I would still let fresh paint cure at least a week before applying. Still happy with the result.

Great stuff. Didn't use it for painting work but to stick things up on a newly painted surface. No damage done. Arrived in far too much packaging for its size.

Expensive but much better than conventional masking tape. I got next to no 'bleed' underneath the tape and it comes away nicely without damaging freshly painted, delicate surfaces.

Just splurged on this tape for a cabinet repaint project over the weekend based on advice from a YouTube video.  And let me say, it was worth it.  when laying this down, I usually went a single strip to create the edge (work with short length and use a painters tool to help ripping clean edges) and then came back with the rosin paper and laid another strip on top.  It held fairly well even with me doing demo and moving appliances around.  The real benefit came on cleanup when I was removing all the protection/masking - the tape didn't pull up the floor wax/coating.

The stuff works better than blue tape.  The paint doesn’t bleed.

If you're looking for the "right tape" to secure and create an edge for your watercolor painting... Go no further than this "Frogtape"!  I've been using watercolor for years and finally my search for a tape that won't rip my paper or let paint seep through, has thankfully ended.  This tape not only adheres to your choice of watercolor paper but it lifts beautifully as well.  Ha! it is so durable... I find I can use the pieces more than once!  Okay... If it's a very fine piece I'm working on, I may set my used tape aside and use new pieces of tape, but for practice the used tape works wonderfully well.  Enjoy your watercolor journey now with the perfect tape!  :)

Good quality tape and good fair price.

I use this to secure the trash bag around my broken leg in the shower. Leg has to be elevated or else water runs under the tape. So it is not a watertight seal. But it comes off easily and doesn't hurt my skin. I am satisfied.

Nice.

If you are an artist -- I'd definitely recommend this  for either holding down the watercolor paper or creating a straight edge with acrylics.  I've used it for both, a bunch of times, and it does the job and cleanly comes off without taking any of the paper with it.I took a panting class and this is the only tape that the instructor recommended.  He practically ordered us to buy it.Since then, I've used it on many watercolor painting with no problems.  (once, maybe?  With a painting that I left taped for months)Traditional watercolorists use gummed kraft tape.  (like: B0BM895DF7).  I have that tape but this works fine and removes much better.  I suppose if you are using an absolutely soaked paper,  the kraft tape is still better.  The kraft tape can also ruin your underlying board  Art supply stores probably have a special-purpose tape and I've not used that.

I was skeptical, but this is the tape to buy.  I could not have completed my detailed mural without it.

I am not a professional painter But even I can get pretty good Results using this tape.  Home depot only carries the green version of this now which is a little thicker and personally I think it is not as good as the delicate yellow.  Do yourself a favor and stock up on this.If you have a home improvement project coming up he won't be sorry.

Try the others and you will come back to this one.  When you do detail painting up against it or with a roller brush...it doesn't bleed.  Better than the rest.  It is our Go To Tape

Great for model car masking

I use this at work to label speed racks, cambros, kitchen things. Appreciate the yellow color, all the other kitchen tape is blue so it makes finding my mise easier. Glue is medium tacky, easy to remove when needed.

Sticks, blocks paint, and comes off - usually without damaging the surface. Wider tape is more forgiving of accidental over painting.Only complaint is that it’s a little thin and sometimes tears when coming off - especially if paint has dried on the tape.The 4 roll pack is a good value. Just store rolls in zip lock sandwich bags to prevent exposure to moisture, which will ruin the paint blocking chemical on the adhesive side of the tape.

As much as I hate painting trim, this tape made it easy. No bleeding under the tape. Just press firmly and start painting.

Much better than green when using it to get a sharp line of paint. Easy to place and remove.

refinishing some old furniture and the latex "Restore" paint tends to lift off with other paint tape.  The glue on this one is light enough as to not pull up the paint with it,

Unlike blue painter's tape, I haven't had any bleed through issues!  Love it for that alone.  Would like to see it in different widths someday....!?

We used it to put a stripe on a 40000 sq ft building and it worked perfectly

The media could not be loaded.
                



I used this for a couple murals and it worked like magic. Exactly what I needed. Make sure to take off the tape while the paint is wet. That's the key.Also, make sure to take protect of the edges of the tape. That's where the seal really is, so you don't want it to get dirty

I have used, and been disappointed by, the blue painter's tape over the years. Whether brand name or not, on paper or not, the blue tape in all its forms has torn my (acrylic) paint. This yellow Frog Tape is awesome. I have only torn my paint once. Me, not the tape. Due to carelessness.The tape can tear paper, but if removed with care, and on paper of good quality, tearing should not be much of a problem. I only paint on paper in my sketchbook so it's not really an issue for me. Works great on wood. I am in love with this tape and recommend it to all artists who have to block out an area or tape off a surface and who work with acrylic paint.

A tad expensive but worth the money as it masked off latex paint perfectly.  Masked line was perfect.  Will use and buy again.

I bought this to mask off a piece of furniture that I painted.  It adhered well and came off easy without damaging the furniture.

It leaves clean lines between the masked paint and the new applied paint.  No damage to surface, including molding, cabinets and drywall.  I also used the green tape with the same results.

Great for masking areas off for paint with no bleed through.  Used for geometric/artistic design on refinishing/painting furniture- super clean/crisp lines!

Best value available. Using for taping Barn Quilts

Best tape I used really sticks nice and easy to remove can paint nice edges with this tape

I put this tape on 1 week old flat paint, painted the trim, then removed the tape within 6 hours or so. The lines are sharp with very little bleed through, and not one bit of the wall paint came off when I removed the tape. The trick is to firmly press the tape onto the wall by running your hands over it several times. In areas where I pressed down only on the half of the tape width closest to the trim, the tape started to peel off. But it sticks nicely if you make sure the whole width seals to the wall. I used a ScotchBlue Painter's Tape Applicator to apply the tape - it's meant for Scotch brand tape but works fine for this tape, which has the same width (1.41"). The applicator makes it very easy to apply the tape, just make sure you press it down with your hands after it's on.

Love frog tape and use it exclusively over the scotch/3M (blue) brand.  We've repainted every way in our house using nothing but the yellow and green version of frog tape (for previous homes, I only used the blue 3M tape and always had problems later with trying to remove it without it either always ripping or pulling up paint with it).  We used the yellow version for surfaces that were freshly painted, sometimes only a matter of hours earlier, or when the underlying paint was old or not very well adhered.  Our rooms have different paint colors on adjoining walls and this tape was perfect for masking off to change colors--the alternative of painting it freehand (not that skilled) or waiting days to weeks for the paint to cure wasn't going to work for us.The line you get from masking off is far superior to the competitors.  You don't have to worry too much about how well it's applied--we never see bleed through even when the paint is applied heavily.  With both the yellow and green versions, we do run into problems with tape adhesion on curved surfaces.  That's the trade-off: to have a tape that has a very good chance of being removed without taking paint with it, the adhesion may not be as strong.  We got around this problem by applying the tape and then running our finger over the edge just before painting.  That was more than enough to ensure the tape was adhered while we painted.The yellow version doesn't stick as well as the green but that's the intent of the "delicate" surface label.  Trust that it'll work---we've been happy with the results.

I had to paint a wide dark blue line over a white smooth finish. So I thought I would give it a try because I knew what the “blue tape” would do.Just wow.  No jagged edges. Worth every penny!

Holds the line, doesn't pull up paint or leave residue, also used along door frame during winter wind storm, re-adheres after opening, no damage to paint or wood. Nice width. 5-STARS

Keeps frogs together!Works great!

Sticks well without causing damage or residue when removed. Love it!

I have used painter's tape for over 30 years but nothing works like this stuff.  I just painted 3 rooms and not one piece of paint got damaged on the trim, walls or ceiling during the removal.  The edge sealing technology is amazing.  There were a couple of spots that leaked but only because I didn't push it in well.  I cannot believe I just learned about this tape and will never go back to 3M blue tape.  Super impressed.

It did exactly what I needed to do

Used for masking finished wood work. Doesn't marr finish when removed.

So far I have used this tape for house painting, crafts and art. It has done well in every single way I've used it. It peels off clean and the paint never ends up under the edge of the tape like it does with typical blue painters tape. So little cleanup required.Tips: As long as you take some extra time to really press down the edge of this tape (use a plastic cake scraper or a credit card and apply gentle pressure along the edge) you will rarely ever have to do touch-up work. And remember to always remove your painters tape while the paint is still wet. Once it dries it can peel off in big clumps.

I'm a professional decorative painter, and this is the tape I use most. It gives a nice sharp edge, and never pulls up existing paint if that paint and/or primer was applied correctly. Make sure to burnish the edge down so there are no air pockets, and there will be no bleeding underneath. It comes up easily if you remove it as soon as you can. I never let paint dry with the tape on. I've seen that do some damage (not with this tape, but I wouldn't risk it). It cuts perfectly with a razor, and doesn't fray at all. Definitely worth the price.

I have used the blue tape for years, but I was painting an area of my home with paint that tended to pull up. This Yellow Delicate Frogtape is amazing. I was worried it would not "stick" well enough but it did - and it comes up so well after painting. This is the only painters tape I am going to use from now on. Buy it.

There are tons of different paint tape but this one is most superior. Super clean pull off lines. Doesn’t bleed through and very easy to work with. Highly recommend

real nice

I saw this in some random video - I had no idea it was a thing. I bought the wider and more narrow styles and love them - perfect for recently painted or other delicate surfaces. Frog tape is my go-to for all painting projects and I’m glad I discovered this product! Highly recommended!

Thought this item would work for my machine and it isn’t working the light indicator is not going off in the dust on the machine is very thick and not going away staying away doesn’t work like the actual one that came with the unit when I purchase it

I paid for and ordered a new product. I got a used product. It was obviously used, the box had been ripped open, the filters had been put in someone else's air purifier, that person apparently did not like them and wadded them up and shoved them back in the box and they were sent back out as new.  Unacceptable.  Low quality.  Avoid these.

Yeah, they’re a great price. But they’re too big for the air purifier I have which takes “this” size filter. Also noticed that the name brand filter has plastic sides, these are cheap cardboard. Which probably means they aren’t HEPA!

Slightly Too big for AC4825

It filters but does not seem to improve air quality all that much. Seems to clog fast, as I can hear the filter start working hard after 1 month. The previous carbon filter I owned you could definitely smell the difference in air quality. It was like ahhh it's fresh. I don't get that with this cheaper carbon filter.

I ordered a 12 piece set, but only received a 4 piece set without the 8 carbon filters

Says compatible and yet it is about 2mm too big for the unit to close. Return was a NIGHTMARE. If you purchase this DO NOT THROW AWAY the shipping box. They will make you pay to return this item! If I could give a 0 stars I would!

This did not fit our air purifier that uses a size B filter it is 1/4 inch or more too long. Absolutely terrible misleading and no carbon filters provided. It is a scam!

I bought these for a germ guardian filter and they are a extremely tight fit. I have to shove them in the unit to fit. The red light on my unit to change the filter will not go off. They don't work.

Ordered the 2 pack only received 1 pack

I've used these for a couple of weeks and could not figure out where a smell of burning plastic was coming from. Finally I turned off my units and realized it was the filters. I've also had a sore throat since I got these. Do not recommend.

I was sent someone else’s returned used filter. That is such a hazard and completely disgusting and unacceptable.

Does not fit purifier. The quality is poor at best. Horrible ,thin charcoal filters included. Also looked like one filter was actually used. And smelled horrible. Very disappointed with this product. Went out, and bought the actual filters. Do not recommend this filter.

It's not fit, a little longer than FLT4825

I didn't get the carbon filters so the air filtration is not working and the red light continues to flash with the old one.

These were inexspensive, not like the name brand, but they dont work or something because when i install these its supposed to make this littke light flash green again. After i put these in the light contiuned to flash red. So i dont even know if these are working or not.

Uggh. This knock off is bordered by foam rather than having precision manufacturing to ensure fit. This poor fit causes a noisy air filter. I can't sleep with this knock off filter, but I can with the original filter. It's just not worth it!

I ordered according to specs that the item said it would fit. It doesn't fit.

These do not fit!  They are too large .....

Only came with hepa filters, no prefilters.  Not as advertised.

Does not work in Germ Guardian.

Could not use them , they were to short

The Hepa filter is too small for what I need.

Wrong size

While the filter was a perfect fit it only lasted for a few weeks before the the red light came on indicating the filter had to be replaced. Definitely not worth the savings.

These are the correct size, but the originals have a plastic yellow housing. After installing the new filter it would not turn on. After inspection, the new filter has a cardboard outer frame that was not solid enough to press down a safety lever on the bottom to allow the filter to turn on. I nearly destroyed the filter trying to get it to depress that lever. I ended up cutting the bottom of the original yellow plastic frame and attaching it to the bottom of this new filter. Then it worked. Kinda sad that I had to modify this to make it work.

Pictures attached comparing a genuine filter from the manufacturer to the filter and pre-filters you get in this pack. The pre-filter has fabric that's more tightly woven than the manufacturer's pre-filter. This has led to restricted airflow and my air purifier isn't able to take in as much air in order to filter it....which is the whole point. Whenever I would put in a genuine filter, I'd notice the difference within a minute (or less) after swapping out an old filter. My air purifier is in front of a closet door where a cat box is, so the purifier is quick to get rid of the smell on a fresh filter. When I put in the filter that came in this pack (after I had to really push it in due to the added foam on the top and bottom), I noticed little difference. It's been a few days and the air quality still hasn't improved and I doubt it will. I'll be purchasing the OEM filters like I should have, it's worth the extra money.

Thought that these would be a cost savings and took a chance on the purchase.  Look and feel same.  Fit is a little tighter but still works in air purifier.  After running the unit for a few minutes with the new filter my room was filled with a horrible chemical odor from the filter that was not immediately noticeable when removed from the packaging.  The cheap plastic odor made my face and head throb.  Since I am chemically sensitive I will need to send these back and buy original manufacturer which have never had an odor or smell to them.  Save yourself time and money if your health is an issue and the reason you use an air purifier in the first place.

The filter does not fit. It's close but it still doesn't work. It looks right but just not right . I'll be returning it.

There was to be 3 filters with charcoal filters. Only the charcoal filters where in the package

Change the old out add the new ones and the red light came on I thought I did something wrong but after reading other reviews I see they are not good will not purchase again

At first these filters look good and all but for people who run their air purifiers all day or at least for extended periods, these filters will not last. Compared to other cheaper ones these fared badly. It worked OK for 1.5 months till lights to change filter came on vs the usual 4-5 months I get with other brands. Very disappointed.

The carbon turned the white filters gray. Would not have been able to tell if the filters were dirty or not. I'm not using the carbon filters because of this issue.

Filters are NOT the same size to fit my particular unit even though it said it was

These do not fit perfectly. You have to jam them in. Still, that would be worth it if they worked as well. However, when we changed the filter at the recommended time, it still looked clean. When we changed my son's in the other room (with the original filter), it was filled with dust. Clearly, this did not catch nearly anything compared to the original.(In addition, this filter does not fix the "change filter" red light that is always flashing. My 4 year old daughter is terrified of the red light. So now we have a "new" filter but cannot use the air purifier because she is scared of the red, flashing light. This also makes it hard to know when it is time to change, since it always says "change filter.")Edit: I wrote about the change filter light but since learned you can get the light to reset by holding down the UV button until it resets. I still think it doesn't work as well but wanted to update this post to reflect that I was wrong about the change filter light.

I’ve bought the off brand ones when the filter gave the red flashing light. The light wouldn’t go off, I assumed it was due to the off brand. Switched to this one and have the red light. But offers good results.

Seems to be working just as the brand names do. Was a bit snug trying to get it into the purifier but haven’t had any issues.

I like the deep sides

I found it a little difficult fitting into the unit

It works

But was able to get cover on

If the price is right I would recommend them... Fit just right

Like HEPA rateing, convenience and availability. . I use for my room purifier.

Lil tight  at first try to put on cos the side material diffrent with the original.. but after couple tries it works well..

Filters were just what I needed. They fit well with the unit.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I had issues with the shipping.  Other than that, great product.

Fits Germ Guardian & is cheaper  price. Works the same.

It fits perfectly on the humidifier

Delivery of refill order is good. Previous orders have worked fine

These are a good replacement filter. Just had a little trouble getting the cover to close easily.

This product works fine with my germ guardian air purifier.  I only wish they weren’t so expensive

Doesn't protect

I bought these because they were much more affordable than the veva brand and they looked to be the same. I found that these collect the dust and dirt from the living room floor very well. The velcro feature to stick the pre-filter to regular filter is very cool. However, and this was an important thing to note, these filters had to be squeezed in to fit the filter cabinet or filter space on the air purifier machine. They don't quite fit exactly right as easily as the veva brand. Also it is important to note that to the red blinking light, which means something isn't right with the machine, blinks with this filter installed oh, and I never had that problem with the OEM brand filters. So, these do the job although they are a little wonky.

I was afraid that these filters were not going to fit or cause the machine to not work like some other filters we had tried. The fit is very tight, the purifier is still working, so I guess all is good.

It’s not an OEM part. This is aftermarket cardboard frame, not a plastic frame. It is a tighter fit than the OEM one and you need to press it in. Other than that the filter media looks identical. I’ll buy it again

Nothing overly special. Direct replacement filters fit how they need to.

The fit of the filter itself was far more snug than other generic brands I've purchased but with a bit of a shove it worked well for the unit. Runs as normal, can't tell the difference from the actual Germ Guardian one that came with the unit. I'd purchase these again.

Glad we found these filter replacements. They are less expensive than what we were using prior, and install a but differently,  but it worked out. Be advised that these muffle the sound less and therefore your unit will be louder than usual.

First package it did not have black filter. There was no memo for directions. So I thought it was missing parts. I claimed and requested refund But I got black filter later on. It was confusing ! Products are great.

This seems to be a fine filter element, but it doesn't fit the Toshiba air purifier for which I bought it.  This could have been a lot more clear, like stating the dimensions of the filter in the ad.

Mine didn’t fit nicely had to use a bit of force to push in. The one I was replacing slides in and out no problem so I’ll see where I got those next time.

Met my needs.

Good

Nothing to dislike.  Great value.  Easy to install.  Will purchase  again when needed.

Good price

This was a great fit for my machines. Quality was good for the price. They have worked well so far

They were not in OEM box but look idenical.  Seem to be doing the job just the way they are supposed to.

Everything it claimed to be.  These simple filters for our air filter arrived quickly and were exactly as described.  Good proce and value in the multipack format.

My GermGaudian Filter would vibrate. I used this filter and how tight it fits stops the vibration.

These filters worked just fine. I had no issues. Would buy them again.

Fast Service, clean, fresh air again!

Everthing fitted properly and shipped fast

Fits, but is a little bigger than original, so it fits very tight.

Good value - easy install and came with several pre-filters which was a plus.  Would buy again.

They worked great thank you

Works just as good as the expensive name brand, just much cheaper.

Quick and easy to install. Works great

Works perfect for my purifier.

Low noise after changing filter.

When are you going to make a washable HEPA filter?

Replacement filter for my Germguardian

Can’t complain

Excellent filters

They are very good filters. Easy to store and discard after use. I think they very good value,  priced reasonably.  Do a good job.

Very good filter fits perfectly

Haven’t ordered these in a while. Same great filters! Work great.

Better value for your money. It's sad to say that I love seeing how much dustbin collects. The filters are amazing. Very easy to install already had the velcro on the filter so you just needed to attach the charcoal.

I got the room air cleaner and wanted replacement filters. Great value. Well made

Item as described, bought multiple times

I just installed these on my germ guardian  air purifier and i was immediately impressed.I have ordered numerous different "knock off" filters for my air purifier and i noticed that some of them contained some kind of cheap nylon woven fiber material instead of the actual carbon filter (like the one that comes with the original filter).This one contains ACTUAL carbon filters that go with the main filter. They are also the thickest carbon filters I've ever received from a "knock off" brand. Seriously, these are so similar to the original that you'd think they're made in the same factory. In addition, i noticed the main filters have a sponge material glued to the top and bottom to give it more of a snug and secure fit inside of the filter compartment. I've never seen this before with other air filters, and it was reassuring to see this seller's attention to detail on the product.I rarely give reviews on products but i really wanted to vouch for this product on behalf of somebody who has asthma and has been searching for a product like this (at a reasonable price) for ages!

Great quality

Replacement Filters...

Can tell the difference of improvement because I dont smell the wildfire smoke in here.

Work as well as original brand for lower price

Bought this and it keeps my room air clean

wow very nice

Easy to install.  Good value for everything received.  I don't know how to judge whether it works or not but it looks like the original filter that came with the unit.

Price is right, quantity is good.  Cannot ask for more.

Just received these and am very impressed at the quality for the priceThe carbon filters are better quality than the original one that came with the purifierDefinitely will buy again

item as described and additional pre filters made it even a better deal. thanks alot

I had a couple I haven't used a year or so... Allergy season is insane this year!!!!Wiped them down.... Installed the filter.... Didn't put the black filter holder piece back. On... So of course it didn't hit the senors..I'll but these again. Snug fit.... 2 pack!!

I've purchased these before for my GermGuardian unit and am very impressed with the quality and durability of these filters. They last nearly 6 months and I love that they include extra carbon filters too! Just need to remember to change those out more often...

Works great and comes with 8 charcoal filters too. Nice for the price.

So I have gotten several brands of these filters - and this brand works well - its snug in the Air Filter.  If it is not snug like other brands then the filter machine will not turn on without having to add something to the top of the filters to make it snug.  A++

These filters fit just right and I love that extra pre-filters are included. Great bargain.

I mark my calendar so I change the pre-filter every 2 months and new filter every six months.

That it fits💘

Loved it cause the filters will last a year. Not bad at all for 20 bucks

easy replacement. extra charcoal filters are a bonus

It fits the machine and is cheaper then the rest.

These things work great and the upside is the black filter can be washed out and reused..

Good quality filters I like that they are bright white color so later I can see easier what they filter out…. Nice !  😀👍

They are easy to install and they give you easy-to-follow instructions so even a child could install it. Great product.

Worked perfectly and was an exact fit. If one can love a HEPA filter replacement..this is it.

The ease of use, dust protection

Exact match for what was in the unit.

These always fit well and have the anticipated use-life in our germ guardian air purifier.

All good. Great deal. Fit perfect in my 2 Germguardian 4825. They are way more quiet after replacing.

Dose it's job.  Bought this product multiple times

Works well great price sturdy fits perfectly

Perfect tight fit and the charcoal filters are washable. Purchased these last time and I washed the charcoal filters I let them dry completely before putting themBack on. The Velcro is very strong and grips the charcoal filter very well so you do not need to worry about it coming off. If you have a Germ guardian that takes these filters do not hesitate they are a quality product.

Perfect fit!

I really like this product and use it in the basement!

Price is great.  Filter fits.

Replacement filters.  Works perfectly.

These are a perfect fit and are well constructed making them a good replacement filter at a much lower cost than original filters.

If you have a germ guardian air purifier you know how costly the authentic filters are. These are excellent alternatives.

good price and  works great

I purchased this for my Guardian AC4800. The HEPA and Charcoal elements of the filter looked and fit like the OME filter set that came with the Guardian air purifier and at half the price. I purchased 4 Germ Guardian air purifiers in 2020 and have been extremely satisfied with their reliability and performance. Access to replacement filters of this quality at this price has contributed to that satisfaction.

It’s what we expected.

It was a good value for the money.

Always a great buy from Amazon.

works good and easy to maintain

I ordered this product which was supposed to contain 4 pre filters and 3 hepa filters. I received the order and only the 3 pre filters were in the box. Started a chat with an agent the day the package arrived to let them know that the order was not fulfilled. He offered me a $10 credit and increased it to $15 when I said no, I’d like the filters instead. I was told (verbatim), “that is not an option”. Chat agent offered me a refund and I declined, stating that I’d like the filters. I called customer service the next day and was told that not being able to fulfill the order is in fact correct because they came from “Amazon Warehouse” and not “Amazon.com” (Uh, what?) and that I do not qualify for their “replacement warranty”. I told them that it’s not a replacement, it’s fulfillment of my ORIGINAL ORDER THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE IN FULL. That didn’t make a difference, apparently. The agent on the phone offered to “open an investigation” to which I agreed (at this point it was about the principle, not the money offered for a refund. How can they advertise a product that they can’t fulfill the order in it’s entirety!?). I was told that I’d be contacted within 48-72 hours with an update and received nothing. When I called customer service back tonight, the (very kind and helpful) woman told me that the previous agent did not do anything in regards to starting an “investigation”. She said that she could see where he talked to me but had no idea what he actually did/did not do as nothing was documented. She reiterated what the two previous agents said by telling me that a refund was really my only option, as the product was from “Amazon Warehouse” and not “Amazon.com”. After almost two weeks of dealing with this mind boggling and infuriating experience, I consented to the refund. Buyer beware- know where your product is coming from. It was advertised as “Amazon Prime” and I’ve never had an issue in the past remotely close to this with items purchased through Prime. To conclude, this is obviously more of a review of the company/customer service because I never actually received the product itself to be able to do a review...

Smells strongly of febreeze.Package smells so much like perfume, and the filters are in plastic buy the still smell like perfume.Cannot run these filters because they will emit that smell into my entire home.Another product ruined my warehouse disinfectant aerosol sprays.

I bought two sets of these. They are very thin and smelled of Ammonia, even the cat objected! When my eyes started watering and my throat started burning, I threw them in the trash. Another costly lesson for me! CHEMICALLY TREATED! That kind of defeats the purpose of an air filter.Non-woven fabrics are textiles that have been created through a process of bonding fibers together, either by some kind of CHEMICAL adhesion, mechanical or heat treatment, or a combination of those. There is no weaving or manual construction involved.

These are made with cheap glue. After a few months of use, it breaks down and smells horrible. They fit our Honeywell and we were hopeful to have cheaper filters, but apparently it's not worth it.

not precut, plus folded, plus L smell, prolly will get a different brand next time

Based off the reviews I thought this would be super close to the OEM but they appear to be the worst generics I've used for my Honeywell purifier.The "HEPA" filters feel basic and fit okay..not snug though.The charcoal pre filters are the worst I've ever seen and I've used several different brands. It is almost 2 inches off!!They also came bunched like they were simply shoved in the box.I need them to be flat to properly place them so I ended up throwing them out and using other ones I had left over from another brand.

We received nice wet box of filters thanks for no refund and not replacing product after complaints do not honor product shipped!

Product arrived quickly, a plus.  But the hepa filters (3) was a bit too snug of a fit and I had to struggle a bit to install them.  I noticed the pre-filters were not as thick as the originals that came with the machine. The original hepa filters fit and removed easily, so that may have been a give away as to quality.  Once the filters were in place, I turned on the machine and I heard a strange high pitch sound and also detected a faint but sickening smell.  I removed the 3 hepa filters and pre-filter immediately.  What could be the problem?  Unfortunately, it cost three times more, but I had to ordered direct from Kaz USA (label at bottom of Honeywell machine). Hopefully when I use their filters, the air will smell clean & "sweet" as before.

After replacing the previous filters with these filters, the air purifier produces an odor that smells like it is burning, sort of a chemical smell.

This product has a strange odor which makes me afraid to use it.  The heap filter has the odor.  Would NOT recommend it.  It should be odorless.  I have ordered replacement filters for my Honeywell Air Purifier and have never previously had this problem.

I could not use these cheap filters. They made the room smell like chemicals and gave me a headache.

I’ve ordered this pack of filter replacements in the past and now for some reason they were not made properly and keep falling out of the air purifier. I’m disappointed and disgusted, already threw out the old filters and now I have to return this garbage and find another company that can make filters that properly fit

I was excited when I first found these hepa filters because they worked very well, but with my last order they had a very weird scent and actually made my asthma worse. One of them also couldnt even fit into the air purifier because the sizing was so off. Now I have to throw away all 3 of them :(

Seemed like a good buy but I guess you get what you pay for.  It arrived in a small box so that the pre filters were folded twice over making them unusable due to the heavy creasing.  They simply will not lay flat against the air purifier intake.

Since the box that the filter came in had written on it "Made in China" I decided to compare the Isinlive filters with Honeywell filters. The black carbon filter when compared to the honeywell black filter seemed to be less dense when I held both up to a light. Since I had a couple of unused Honeywell black filters, I used them rather than the Isinlive ones.  I also thought the HEPA white filters were not as well made as the Honeywell when compared side by side.

About a month after we've had these in use smelling almost a burning plastic smell and after testing and playing around it turns out it's the big HEPA filters, not the charcoal ones. I will not be ordering these again.

I've bought several of these filters but no more.  They are a complete waste of money, over $30 for three white filters, you know, the filters that actually matter unlike the 4 charcoal filters.  Over $10 per filter that lasts maybe 3 months at best?I'll never buy another filter or purifier like these again.

Update: The seller did send me a modified version of this filter, they now have installation direction arrows, and they are working really well. Hopefully the newer design will continue to work well.I have no idea how these filters have any decent reviews. Total trash. They didn’t fit well and made my system howl. I had to remove them within an hour. I hate paying full price for the Honeywell filters, but at least they work properly.

Air coming from my Honeywell filter had the worst chemical smell after these filters were installed. Had to discard them & order actual Honeywell filters...Not a savings at all.

I had to throw away after 2 weeks because it was not effectively working.  I woke up each day congested, with the Honeywell brand could smell the difference, if I was having a hard time breathing could turn on and it would clear up.  This filter was essentially useless.  It did not filter anything it needed to, will not purchase again.  Spend the extra dollars to get the real deal.

I am returning the filters because they make the air smell like bug killer.

Has a bad odor so not able to use it.It’s for a Honeywell 300

The seller advertised that the 4 filters were all compatible with my Honeywell HPA 304 Air Purifier.None of them were…ALL the wrong size!UGH!

Had high hopes for these filters but they made the air smell worse.

I bought these a few times (same seller “littlenature”), and they worked well but my latest purchase was really poorly made with crooked edges and wouldn't even fit into the filter. Compared to past purchases it looks like these have been cheapened for greater profit.

Not a HEPA. it's way too small and the black filters are not carbon activated. Will not be getting again

Wrong size!!!!

This only came with 2 HEPA filters. I need a third one, but I don't have it. Now I'm scrambling to figure out where a trustworthy place I Can order a third one from.

The pre-filter size is slightly smaller than the original filter size, hence does not cover the hepa filter completely. Because of this I think the hepa filter is going to collect dust faster.

Extremely bad fumes. Had to throw it out

You sent me the wrong ones or are advertising different filter these do not fit this brand at all

The price was surprising so I decided to give them a try, but sadly they were very thin and the size didn't quite fit my hpa300, I was very skeptical of their effectiveness!

This is my second time ordering these filters. The first time was fine but the second time it gave the unit a funny smell. I ran it with just the carbon filter, smelt fine. Then ran it with the hepa filter and that where the smell came from. Disappointed to say the least.

Do not buy this product, it has a chemical smell, the filters are not true hepa filters. Save your money and buy one replacement filter at a time from honey well. I bought the honeywell purifier, which came with filters, but the official filter was not available. I purchased these and when needed replaced the old filters with these. A strong odor came out of the machine, very strong chemical smell.

Carbon filters are the incorrect size and require cutting, contrary to product summary.  Disappointing.

I can’t even use these. They smell like melting plastic!! If these are defective I would like a replacement please because these are unusable

The product fit my air purifier, but leaves a plastic/chemical smell in the air that is making me cough.  I’m hoping the smell will be short lived, otherwise they’re going back.

I bought this set as the real Honeywell filters are very expensive but these do not work.  The red light remains on and the basement smell is back.  Have ordered the expensive proper filters so this was a waste of money.

I purchased two of these filter sets for my two Honeywell HPA300 air purifiers. After a month of continuous use on the "General Clean" Setting, both air purifiers started to emit a smell that, to me, was reminiscent of burning plastic or a failing motor. I assumed my air purifier motors were going bad, but I also considered it to be strange that both air purifier motors were going bad at the same time (one of the air purifiers is much older than the other). So, as a test, I ordered Honeywell’s HEPA Air Purifier Filter Kit to try with one of the air purifiers. I installed the Honeywell filters, and after turning on the air purifier, I immediately noticed that the burning plastic/failing motor smell was gone. After one week of continuous use, the air purifier was still working great (producing clean air with no smell). So, I ordered a second Honeywell’s HEPA Air Purifier Filter Kit to install in my second air purifier. After installation, I noticed the same thing: the plastic burning/failing motor smell was gone. I have now been running both air purifiers on the general clean setting for a while (one three days, one 10 ten days) and they are both working great. I am submitting this review to help others save some money and not make the same mistake that I made.Update March 8, 2024: Customer Service reached out to me and offered me a full refund.  I'm happy they reached out to me so I increased the product rating to two stars.

The main filter is great fits correctly. The pre-filter, is just large pieces that you have to cut to fit and is folded. Then you end up with pieces that are only a few inches wide. Also, you can see through the pre-filter fabric. The one that came with the device is not see through.

The white filter material is very thin, the number of folds is not as much as in the picture, the size is a little small, the black carbon cloth can be translucent, I'm not sure of the effect, it is better to buy original

Doesn't fit my hpa300, he seems to be a little smaller, doesn't hold it in place very well, always falls off when not snapping the case, and the origami paper is very thin, not worth the money!

Based on title and description bought it. the 4 pre filters is misleading. Its a big sheet that needs to be cut. But you cant cut into 4 sheets of size to match purifier. I can get max 2 filter if am lucky with this . Works though haven't seen a issue with quality. but 4 prefilters is misleading. That needs to change.

The prefilters are not sized to fit. I had to cut them to make it fit.

After two months these look worse than my Honeywell filters did after almost a year. I don't know if it's from the prefilter being too porous or what, but there's no way they should need replacing already. Threw everything out and went back to Honeywell.

Don’t recommend.  These were not as good as the filters that came with my machine.

Both the prefilter and hepa filters were cut too small for my Honeywell. Unsure of what degree of difference it will make in the machine’s efficiency.

Better knock off out there

The carbon filters are not precut.They are large filters folded up. It's near impossible to flatten them and cut to the right size.Pay the extra and get the proper filters.

Got this for the Honeywell air purifier, it doesn’t fit and the change filter light remains on. Waste of money

These do not fit in snuggly at all. I unwrapped them  because I need them now for some home construction we're doing, so I can't return them, but I will not buy them again. The 100 was just as bad, but the 300 is more noticeable. Too me I think that leaves to much space where things can get thru unfiltered. The black filters were folded in 4s so they're super wrinkled and hard to keep in but hopefully they'll straighten. I'll have to buy another brand soon to replace these.

I bought this bundle several months ago and had initially only been using the charcoal pre-filters.  They do come folded in fourths, so installation is a bit of a challenge due to the deep creases.  (It was easier to keep in place under the clips if the crease is on top.)  I tried to install the 3 main filters yesterday, but immediately noticed a heavy chemical smell upon removing each filter from the plastic bags.  After installation and turning the unit on, the smell was quite noticeable.  I took the filters outside and let them "air out" for several hours and then placed them in the garage overnight.  I just reinstalled them, and noticed the smell again upon turning the machine on.  I ran the turbo mode for several minutes, and the smell has now lessened, but still remains.  I do not know why they have an order.  I will try placing them outside again today for an additional "airing".  Is it the filter itself or from the plastic bag it came in?  Regardless, the smell is a concern (as others have mentioned) and although the price is reasonable, I most likely will not repurchase these in the future.

The pre-filters(black) are huge....way larger than the white filter.  I had to cut it down to size to fit and since they were folded up, it didn't want to sit right in my Honeywell air purifier. These are significantly cheaper than the name brand ones, so it's not a huge issue, just wish I would have k own this before purchasing. We'll see how well they work in comparison.

The only notable issue is the fact the carbon filter is folded making the fit a little difficult.  I placed the carbon filter under a large cutting board with some weight, the fold lines straightened out on in a day; making the fit much better.  The other three filters had no issues and fit just fine.

The black filter is not the correct size. Short about 1/4 inch. Doesn't stay in position. Not sure how well it will work with the gap.

Price's are just so high,  easy to remove old install new.

These filters are very similar to the brand  name that I usually purchase at 3 times the cost.

Just what I expected.

This came super-fast and a complete kit. The only downside is that the oem filters show you what direction to install filters and this does not. Not super critical in order to figure out but it definitely would be helpful for those who need it broken down for them....

The product is a good value. The pre-filters should com rolled instead of folded.

Easy to install the filter annd  easy to cut the prefilter. A necessary product to maintain the Honeywell air purifier.

Everything good but the black pre filters come in uncut sheets. Not a big deal. Easy to cut.

The white pleated filters are fine and fit well. However, the black pre-filter comes in two oversized sheets that you must cut to fit some of the systems. Not a huge deal but cutting it to fit just right can be a pain.

Material in HEPA filters seems thin and is not as high grade as other compatible H13 filters offered!

these fit very well --- better than the other ones I was using. I switched from those because the price went up a lot.  Like other reviewers, I noticed a smell when I first installed.  It did go away, but not sure I'd buy these again.

Price is wonderful

These filters were less expensive than the manufacturer's version.  They fit correctly in my HPA300.  No issues. Well, maybe one little thing would be that since they arrive folded (the large back piece) they need a bit of time to get the fold out of them.  I like that I have three of the black charcoal filters.  I know everyone's life is different.  My air purifier often gets full of dog and bunny hair.  Weekly I vacuum the black filter to ensure proper airflow.  I've taken to replacing all filters once a year and the charcoal one twice a year.  It works for us.

The filters fit perfect but my only problem is the change filter light won’t go off do now I’m paranoid because I won’t know when to change the filters again . It’s been 3months and I’m ordering the original filters from Honeywell so basically I wasted my money on the one that cost half the price

Quality seems very similar to the original manufacture filters. Honestly, can’t tell any difference aside from the price is quite a bit cheaper :)

My order was received in a timely fashion. I had a bit of a problem inserting the 2 white filters that are installed vertically (they seemed to be a bit larger than the space). But, after a little finagling I got them in. Other than that I was very pleased with the product and now my air purifier is up and running again. I will order again.

This filter set is for the HPA 300 room air cleaner. While all air cleaners are not really very good, Consumer Reports listed this as one of the best. We like the unit but the filters are very expensive and like printer ink, the consumables are the "real" cost. Installation is easy and this package is very user friendly.

These fit as well as the more expensive ones but the one difference I noticed was that these have less pleats in the filter than the more expensive ones. Not sure how much this affects filtering performance but just something noted.

We received our filters and they are great.  The pre-filter though came in a huge sheet and I had to cut it down to size to fit.  This could be a production issue but I have plenty of material to get thru the year supply.

These filters fit our unit properly.  They last as long as the original filters and appear to remove as many contaminants.

These fit my HEPA filter well enough, but honestly I feel like my allergies are a little worse than they were with the original filters.  Still much better than no filter at all though.

Fit was good, easy installation, seems to work just fine.  Removal tabs a little cheaper than the factory, but you aren't gonna remove it until you're replacing them with a new set (not a big concern).  Would buy again.

This size wasn't what I expected.  I had to trim it several times so that it would fit in the front grill of the machine.  It definitely served its purpose.

Priced at a much easier to swallow dollar amount than the official filters. That said, I think the official Honeywell filters fit marginally better (although unlikely to make a real difference)

Runs a bit small and I had to wedge some of my spare carbon filter in between the HEPA filter to hold them in. Seem very well made and a good value.

Carbon filters need to be cut to size.

The filters fit perfectly. The pre-filter needed some minor trimming. I would purchase these filters again.

Great value- great product. I was shocked by how well they filtered. Definitely a good alternative to paying the too high price for honeywell brand.

The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is that the black filters aren’t cut to fit as well as the name brand ones. Otherwise awesome savings for these filters!

Set ordered for Honeywell Air Purifier, charcoal pre-filter required trimming to fit like the original, but overall value is great, and we immediately noticed an improvement in air quality.

nice combination

The carbon pre-filters were bent in half to ship them, which made installation more difficult.

Item fit the air purifier perfectly, and it is running well.  They seem thinner than the original filters, but the cost is lower.

It fits perfectly with my humidifier. Easy purchase and well worth the price.

Used the filters for Honeywell air purifier great product and very easy to install.

Works just as well as the Honeywell’s. Just have to cut to size.

They work

They’re filters, they work great.

Better value than the name brand itself.

A great alternative to the brand

Wish it was ready to apply, no cutting required

Seems to do an equal job as oem, at a fraction of the price!

Does the work

Product was great, just as described.  Work perfectly!!

Great filter!

Product arrived as promised and worked great.

Without the ability to measure actual air quality differences between these and the OEM Honeywell filters, it's hard to say how they compare on that front. But they do look and feel similar enough to the OEM filters that I'm sure they work just as well. On the whole I am happy with the quality and the price of these.From the product description I was expecting the activated carbon pre-filter to fit HPA300 units out of the box, but mine were 4x larger than this and require cutting them down to fit. Maybe they sent the wrong product or something, not sure.

Good & recommended!

Worked just fine

Fast delivery and worked just as well as the ones that came with the HPA300. Great savings, will surely buy again.

I have been purchasing isinlive replacement filters for my Honeywell air purifier multiple (6) times, and they have consistently exceeded my expectations. These filters are undoubtedly my go-to choice, and I always feel delighted with their performance.One of the standout features of these isinlive replacement filters is their compatibility with a wide range of Honeywell air purifier models, including HPA300, HPA304, HPA3300, HPA3300b, HPA5300, HPA8350, and HPA300VP. This versatility ensures that no matter which Honeywell air purifier you own, these filters have got you covered.The filters are made from H13 True HEPA material and feature a carbon layer. This combination provides multiple levels of cleaning that significantly improve indoor air quality. The True HEPA filter effectively captures particles and allergens, while the activated carbon layer helps to eliminate odors, making the air in my home noticeably fresher and cleaner.The inclusion of pre-cut activated carbon pre-filters is a thoughtful touch. These pre-filters extend the life of the primary HEPA filters, saving both time and money. The package includes 3 HEPA filters and 4 pre-cut activated carbon pre-filters, ensuring you have everything you need for a complete replacement. The dimensions are also perfectly designed to fit your Honeywell air purifier, so installation is a breeze.What truly sets ISLive apart is its commitment to customer satisfaction. They offer a product assurance that gives me peace of mind. If I'm not completely satisfied with anything about the filters, they promise a full refund or reshipping a new pack.

Fits perfect and a great price!!

I’ve bought these replacement filters a handful of times and I love them. Great quality, easy to replace and cut to size. My household suffers from allergies and asthma, with having two pets I notice the air is cleaner with these filters. My air purifier performs just as well with these budget friendly filters. I keep my purifier on turbo and the noise is the same. The functionality is worth the investment.

The fit was great and quality  seems to match brand that was removed

Works well and very affordable.  Definitely recommend it

Works in my Honeywell air purifier! Will order again when I need refills

These were much less than other filters and exactly what we needed.  The quality is good.

They worked perfectly with my machine.

The product is great and worth the priceI love it

Great quality & price.

Air purifier filter replacement

Just what I ordered a fair price and it arrived quickly. Very happy.

Much cheaper than honeywell filters! I'm really happy that I got a good deal on these because the honeywell filters are just too expensive.

This is a purchase we make every 6 mts. Fut our air purifier perfect

These fit my Honeywell just fine and catch a lot of stuff. I do wish there were more pre-filters; I go through them more than prescribed because they get nasty.

These are great replacements and good quality.

Delivery was actually ahead of schedule and the product came undamaged and as advertised.

These are a great replacement for the Honeywell HPA304 (this one https://amzn.to/4c5eZRZ ).  The filters fit in perfectly as well as any others I have tried including the OEMs, and I really, really appreciate the inclusion of the charcoal filters.  As a tip for others, I find if I vacuum the charcoal filter from time to time, I can extend the life of the filters and thus reduce my total costs of ownership.  Hope that helps you do the same!

No hassle. Old filters out, new ones in.

Perfect for our home use Purifier.

Very good

works great!

These hepa filters fit perfectly in my room air purifier. Filters arrived as promised and do the job for me. The addition of several carbon pre filters is a bonus. Very satisfied with purchase.

These filters work great and last .

They work great.

Perfect fit and function

It is a must to keep your filters up to par. Reorder this product. It is a great product.

Good price.  Works as intended.  Highly recommend.

The filters fit just right and are performing well. I like the price and will buy more from this source when I need more.

Fits my machine perfectly.  Came as expected.

I love that this comes with a lot of pieces at a reasonable price, was nervous this would be the wrong size but nope it fit right in my air purifier with no issues. Will purchase again when needed

Money saver, fit my air purifier and no need to trim the carbon filter.  Only con was the carbon filter was folded.

Price for double the filters was very good.

Perfectly fits my Honeywell air purifier there's no bad smell I don't know what the other reviews are even talking about

Exactly like the brand name version

Filters fit my air purifier great and easy to install

Fit my air purifier perfect for a lot less money than the brand ones. Happy with them.

All 4 Parts, Fit Well, in the Air Machine. So---- All Good.

As expected, you get a lot of the carbon filters which is nice.

The HEPA filters seem to last a long time. You also get 4 pre-filters which also fit nicely. These filters are replacements for a Honeywell 300 air purifier.

Ease of ordering fit and cost

You know when to replace them

The HEPA R filters are a perfect fit for Honeywell purifiers, and fit at least as well as the Honeywell originals. The R filters have precisely the same amount of pleats as the originals. If you have an HPA-300 series purifier that takes three (3) HEPA R filters, you will NOT have to cut the model A prefilters.I wish the A prefilters were 1-2mm longer and wider, but they fit well enough if you stretch and pull with some patience. The kit has eight (8) pre-filters, which I thought was generous. These black A prefilters clean up pretty well if you blow with an air-compressor. Perhaps careful vacuuming would work as well.There was no odor, not even a slight fragrance, when I received the package. If there were, I would think that allowing filters to off-gas in a garage or closet for a some days would solve the issue.Note: The R HEPA filters show no improvement after trying to clean by blowing with an air compressor, only the A prefilters clean up well.

Using these for my Honeywell HA300BHD air filter (465 ft). I’ve had the air filter for four years and primarily use it for my (larger than normal) bedroom in a warehouse in Brooklyn where the dirt and dust coming from the city streets and Williamsburg Bridge just a few blocks away and usually run it 24/7 all year on the lowest level and turn it up when necessary (smells from cigarette smoke, cooked foods, paints/sealants) and a little more this past year (as a possible aid to keep me and my roommate safer during the earlier days of the pandemic). These filters seem to be working as most of the ones I’ve purchased in the past... generally longer than the three months suggested by filter and air filter machine makers. (I also vacuum excess dust off charcoal pre-filter from time to time.) I’ve had “messier” charcoal pre-filters but not sure if that’s any indication as having more charcoal filtering or being better. These fit quite well in the Honeywell although one of the HIPA seemed slightly looser than the others. I like that I don’t have to cut the pre-filter. Most importantly, I would price out several brands (that have positive ratings) and buy more than one set... it’s more cost effective than buying just what you need at the moment, and you’ll always have back up when the filter replacement light comes on.

Works as expected, fit well, price was right!

Quality product for a great price

The charcoal filter has the same, if not less, activated charcoal than the OEM official Winix branded activated charcoal filter.They say it's "full of charcoal" and show a picture of one with far more charcoal than is in the one I received. The mesh that covers the hexagons "full" of charcoal is also poorly cut and there's little bits hanging off. That's probably just cosmetic, but it definitely doesn't have the fit and finish of the official replacements.Time will tell if the value is there because at the end of the day the product is cheaper than the original one.

Does not fit, Winix air purifier has a filter sensor and it is not compatible. Light is still flashing after installation of this filter.

Intended to purchase original Winix brand replacement filter which always works well, has no odor and leaves the air smelling clean. This was purchased by accident and had an odor from the moment I opened the bag. I gave it a try for three days but could no longer stand it. Even people coming into my office noticed the smell so I ordered an original and threw this one away. Cannot return and get my money back because i threw it out. Don't waste your money.

Do not buy! This product does not work. It actually made my allergy worse. First of all, the charcoal filter has black powder dust and it will be sucked in to and released into the air. The HEPA filter they claimed to be is not dense enough to catch the dust particle and cause my allergy to be 10 times worse without it. Cheaper filter doesn't work. I had to return all my extra filters that I bought and buy the official filters and I have no more itchy/runny nose or congestion.Just want to help those who think you might save few dollars but, it doesn't help with allergies but cause allergies with this charcoal filter so don't buy them.  I had to change them out within a week, so it actually ending up costing me more money.

Do not buy. Not a proper fit.

I have a particle meter and these did bring the level down near zero when they were new, but now 45 days later it won't anymore. These are not equivalent. The name brand filter would take my room down to 0.1 PM2.5 level even after a year of use.

The HEPA filter fits perfectly in the 5500-2. The charcoal filter however is slightly smaller than a winix original charcoal filter when compared together. But I will say that the charcoal filter does have a lot more charcoal pellets than the original winix.UPDATE. Contacted by seller and they sent a replacement set of filters. Good customer service.Update #2. Ordered again. The hepa filter leaves a small gap on each side and now the charcoal filter has a different screen and it literally cut the air flow in half so I didn’t use it. Would not recommend if you want to maintain airflow and not burn out your machine.

box arrived open and rippedfilter arrived broken too.

Is this simply a defective set!?  Was what appeared to be a perfect copy of the Winix TrueHEPA filter legit? Or, is what looked to be a well-made honeycomb/framed carbon filter, actually blowing off mass amounts of SOOT!? It  was almost a frightening discovery(no joke)  🤢 😳Understand, there is no fireplace inside our dwelling!?! And, I promise the previousOEM filter lasted a long time I would love to discuss the filter issue with “it’s maker” ...in fact, I feel I must! For I cannot, in good conscience, give you the go ahead[to purchase]  Will follow-up, as applicable.

Isinlive claims their filter is "Full of Activated Carbon" and they even show a picture supposedly 100% filled with carbon and another competitor only half full.  This is fraud.  The Isinlive is half full, just like the original Winix carbon filter.  Not happy.

This is supposed to replace a Winix Filter H #116130. Ive attached 3 pictures showing that the HEPA filter as well as the activated charcoal prefilter are both significantly too small (as well as thinner than an original, or even other aftermarket brands.) Obviously letting large amounts of unfiltered air theough the air purifier. Disappointed, but maybe I should've known better for the price.

Upon opening, could tell item had been retuned as packaging was re-taped and inner plastic wrap on filters was opened. The “new” Hepa filter was dirty and had black dust throughout it. Looked to have been very used. Returning. What a disappointment!

I never experienced so much off gassing from a filter before. It smells toxic and defeats the purpose of cleaning the air.

They worked fine initially, but after about 2 months of only occasional use they are giving off a burnt(?) smell. Definitely not worth it. Also, the carbon filter sheds a lot of fine carbon dust.

Does not fit AM80. Cheap garbage that I am returning.

Purchased this product because of price and also because it stated it was compatible. Unfortunately I spent money, put it in the machine to test it out and it doesn’t work. Waste of funds

Filter was defective.  It was longer on 1 side than the other causing it to buckle when inserted (see 3  photos)

I bought this thinking it would be a good replacement for original filter. Don’t waste your money. Didn’t even last a month. It’s just my husband and me. Our house is regularly cleaned. There’s no reason for this to have happened! Sending back

Went to wash charcoal filter and soap and water will not go through filter even high pressure from the water the water hose. If water can't get through how can the air? PURE TRASH!

I have replaced the filters with these new ones and they came half broken. Now the smoke is in my apartment. Don’t buy!

I purchased this item, but my red light is still indicating that I need to replace filter.

DO NOT BUY

My machine stoped working saying it’s the wrong filters

I bought it in October and it's already saying it's time to change it! No where close to the time it says it is supposed to last! It doesn't even look that bad either! I am really disappointed and I won't buy another one of these for sure! My original one lasted 2 times longer than this one did! It didn't really fit tight enough either! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 I also kept the outer screen filter clean, washed it at least every couple of days! So sad!😔

Bends and creases easily.

I bought these before, and they worked alright. This time I went to buy them again and decided on the 4 pack since I have 4 filters in the house. However, the 4 pack is just the HEPA filters, not the carbon filters. I didn't realize that until they arrived this morning. The H filter requires a carbon filter to fit, so if you order the 4 pack you are stuck with the old carbon filters. It does not seem possible to order the carbon filters separately, so I'm not sure why they offer the HEPA filters by themselves.

After following all usual instructions I cannot get rid of the “ red filter” warning- after checking with the Air Cleaner Manufacturer, it appears they seem to have “ locked in”a way to assure you only buy THEIR filters!!  ( I’ve come across similar restrictions in the past )

Fits the Winix just fine. Cleans air just fine. Seems to be HEPA media, and the charcoal was maybe BETTER than the Winix original. But that's where the plusses end. This went yellow and gross in 90 days. It's not even pollen season! The original lasted 9 months or more, this one 90 days. Ouch. Half the money... but less than half the lifespan.

After the western wildfires soiled my original filter after a couple of months, I was looking for an alternative to the full-price Winix filter and purchased this one. I feel like it never did as good of a job. You can tell that the air quality is poorer with the isinlive filter. Sure it caught the dust, but my nasal congestion returned and the apartment had more of an odor of pet. I gave it a couple of months, but when I replaced it with a Winix filter, within minutes, the air felt more breathable and smelt less like my animals. Unfortunately, it's the full-price name brand filter for me going forward.

The main charcoal filter was bent / scewed. Meshing wasn't cut correctly. Sucks way more air through which makes me believe the filter is sub par from the original. It still filters but not sure if it's hepa rated. Not sure why this would be an amazon choice product.

I bought this because it has the pellet-style carbon filter like the original. However, it's worse than useless. It absorbs smells for about a day, and then RELEASES them from that point on. So if you put it in an area that has a smell and then move it elsewhere, it will stink up the new area. The air coming out of my purifier smelled bad until I took the carbon filter out. The "mesh" carbon filter elements in cheaper kits work much better than this. No complaints about the HEPA element, but it's the same as you'll find in other kits. Don't waste your money!

I don’t think the filter I received was as high quality as others I’ve used.  Within three weeks after installing this filter, the fan’s exhaust area was incredibly dusty — meaning all of those particles were getting past the filter. All filters were installed correctly.  When I moved the unit for cleaning, I also noticed a dust outline on the floor where the unit used to be. This filter way under performs in comparison to the manufacturer’s filter and other brands (both with slightly higher price point, albeit).  To me, the couple bucks I saved isn’t worth the performance. Would not recommend.

Filter seems fine. However, the charcoal filter screen was peeling off the edge and charcoal fell loose. Also very dusty

Purchased this filter in January 2021. Worked well with no issues until June 2021. Air purifier began sounding different, making baffle noises and air flow coming out of top was a lot less than when filter was new. Will be going back to the genuine filter because they actually last a full year as advertised.

Disappointed that upon opening the charcoal filter and placing into my machine the black charcoal started turning the filter black.

I will not purchase again.

The white filter fits my Winix 5300-2 decently, but the black carbon filter is too thick as seen from the side view picture. It also restricts air flow and puts too much pressure on the machine. Barely any air flows through then the carbon filter is installed. Also, the red light never turns off when you have the filters installed. *updated description now says it’s only for the Winix 5500*

The activated charcoal filter doesn't fit the unit and has gaps, which defeats the purpose of filtering. Need the hepa filter and will use refills that came with the unit and order from manufacturer going forward.

Looks high quality but does not fit, leaving gaps on the 2 sides (as picture) asked for a replacement, the new one came but still not fit. Going to return both sadly 😔

Both the HEPA filter and the carbon filter are about 1/4" shorter than the OEM filters, this leaves a gap on the top that i'm sure hinders the efficiency of the filter. The replacement HEPA filter is also quite a bit lighter than the OEM, not sure if this is due to the dust that has filled the original or if it's made of worse materials. Hopefully it's actually a TRUE HEPA filter...

The filter pack contains the HEPA filter plus the charcoal filter. It fits very well, as good as the OEM. The filter also seems to be doing a good job at filtering particulate. However, the charcoal filter does not manage odors nearly as well as the OEM pack. If your primary need is gross particulate filtering, this set is a good alternative. If you have severe allergies and also want the benefit of odor control, I recommend spending the money for the OEM solution.

This filters are perfect and fits perfect on my air purifier.

There is a gap in the width when I insert it into my winix purifier. The seal is not as good as the original OEM filter

The carbon filter screen(that which retains the carbon particles) is a great deal more dense than the original filter. There are also more carbon particles than original. Although the carbon screen captures more particulates than the original, it also reduces air flow. Which I assume makes the motor work harder. Price and fit wise it's a great deal. I'm just not sure in the long run that it won't affect the unit adversely.

Fits my Winix 5500-2 perfectly. The only problem with it, running it on the highest setting makes the motor work harder. There’s not enough airflow between the filter and fan. But when it’s run between fan settings 1-3 I don’t hear an issue. I just wouldn’t let it run on the highest setting If I’m not monitoring it. It’s fairly priced but you get what you pay for. I may just buy the name brand next time to not risk burning my machine out.

Carbon filter is too thick, so the prefilter will not fit! You have to use it without the prefilter that comes with the Winex,

Filter material much thinner than the original factory filter,  charcoal pieces fewer than original.Fits the machine perfectly.You get what you pay for!

Not sure why, but relatively soon after installing, purifier shows to change out the filter. 😐

As good a replacement as the name brands!  So far so good!

Fits my 5500-2 snugly / like OEM.The carbon filter has a slightly higher fill rate compared to OEM (maybe 80% of each hexagon is filled whereas OEM is 65%) however the carbon pellets are around half the size. Not sure if this is good or bad. It appears to allow enough airflow through the filter which is good.The HEPA filter seemed a little thin but air quality measurements from a cheap sensor appear to show improvements.Overall seems like a pretty solid 3rd party replacement option.

These filters are great when replacing the brand name filters. I have multiple purifiers in my home and they all take different filters. I have been very happy with how well they fit and how much money I save when buying the generic brand. I always purchase them on Amazon because they are easy to search for with no problems.

I’ve tried a couple of different brands for filter swaps on my winix 5500-2 model purifier and this is by far the best fitting filter set on the market. The carbon filter build quality is leagues better than others I’ve tried and it fits super snug (others tend to leave a gap at the edges or fit loose). The paper filter itself has wider gaps than others I’ve tried which I believe would make it harder to trap dust and dirt, but easier to clean off.

This fit our unit perfectly and was priced really well!

I've been using these filters for four years, and they work very well with our Winix 5500-2. As of September 2024, you can get four filters for $26, which is fantastic, and depending on your home's dust/pollutant count, the filters can last anywhere from 3 months to six months. For best results, you should probably change them per the manufacturer guidelines, but if you're desperate to stretch a buck, so long as you're on top of the pre-filter cleaning, and you can properly dust off your charcoal filter with a HIGH POWER electric duster, you should get some decent results out of these.

I run two of the Winx 5500-2 24X7.  My wife has many allergies so it critical we have clean air and these filters need to be changed on a regular basis.  This is a great deal to keep me stocked.  Fit seems to be great and no issues thus far.

Installing the 5500-2 Air Purifier Filter Replacement was a breeze—simply pop it in, and it’s set to go, fitting perfectly into my Winix air purifier. The previous filter was due for a change, and immediately upon installation, I could tell the air quality had improved; it was definitely time for a refresh.Price-wise, I did some shopping around and found that this 4-pack offered one of the better deals available online, making it an economical choice without compromising quality. In terms of performance, I can’t distinguish between these filters and the original Winix filters, which speaks volumes about their effectiveness in cleaning the air just as well as the brand-name ones.For anyone using the Winix 5500-2 or AM80 air purifiers, I’d highly recommend these replacement filters. They're a reliable and cost-effective option that doesn’t skimp on quality or functionality. Whether you’re dealing with dust, pollen, or other allergens, these filters handle it all seamlessly.

The quality of the product is sturdy and last a longer time than the generic products.Also easy to use.

Very  happy with this product

Thus I go through a lot of the actual filter elements. Although I'm unable to test the efficacy of a non EOM element, they seem to do as well as the original Winix elements but at ~1/4 the price. They fit just as well as the original Winix elements and they are an excellent money saver.These Winix filters are Hepa 13 (filtering particles down to 0.3 microns) and if you actually need a hospital grade Hepa 14 unit, (filtering particles down to 0.1 microns) the only units I have found are the Puroair ones sold here by Amazon. Both the Winix and Puroair filters are superior to all others I have compared them to and Amazon sells both.

Fit of plastic frame of paper component required a little trim to fit, otherwise ,as advertised.

Does the job but the purifier definitely sounds different now.

The charcoal filter can be washed and lasts longer than the hepa. So for that, they should sell each separately.

As advertised

The new filter caused change filter light to come on once but since I reset it no problems. Would proubly buy this again.

Fit exactly like the OEM filter, and quality of the materials seemed just as good as well. One star off for a bit more charcoal in filter which at first I thought was a good thing, but on high you can tell unit works a bit harder to suck air.  All in all will buy again in a year when I have to buy a new filter.

These are great replacement for the money however I did notice the hepa filter had to be replaced slightly sooner then the original winix filters

Hepa filter is not as dense as the original version but it should hold up for a year.

Fits perfect. Compared to OEM, I can hear the fan working harder which means airflow is more restrictive. However, given the price of the filter, it’s worth it.

Good value and build quality, but it produced a hint of a plastic smell for the first couple of days since the installation.

Used for room air filtrationA bit expensiveWhat is sheerness?

Good replacement for my Winix. Wish it was a little more affordable. Needs to know if this is recyclable.

Perfect match. Will purchase again.

Seems to be working ok.  No issues with it.

A bit hard to get air through if you’re attaching to a regular fan.

Effective does the job ans easy to install

Very good filter but does lower airflow marginally

Easy simple replacement not as thick as original but does the job well.

Fit right in no problem

Nice high quality carbon pre filter.

Easy to install

Good filters, Great deal!

Solid replacement

I was really surprised by the price of OEM replacement filters. This isn't rocket science, it is filter technology that has been around for 50 years. The HEPA and activated carbon filters fit just like the originals and the price, while still high for what you get, is acceptable.

Very easy to install. Completed task under a min. Cost effective. Arrived promptly and intact. As for the filter efficiency, it is difficult for me to tell unless I have some kind of professional device (I haven’t noticed a significant reduction in dust but my old house is dusty in the first place) but  my Winix does seem to be running stronger.

The price is right and the product is look good. Fit the machine just right.

Filters fit well, and they do clean the air

Perfect fit for my unit.

I love this product it works well with my WINIX air purifier.

I used for a Winix air purifier

Lasts as long as oem filters. Much cheaper. Filters the air just fine. I replace these about every 6 months and vacuum the pre filter twice a month.

It’s really helped the air quality in my apartment.

Sorry my previous review said there were only three filters in the box. That is not correct. I received all four.

Items as described. Shipped fast and in appropriate box very sturdy. Very pleased.

this hose fit perfect, happy with my purchase

A nice price.

I used for coupleMonths and when pull off to change screen you see what you would of been breathing!! It makes you need this and wondering why I didn't have one years ago .very cool the way it works too . You can see if anything is different smoke bug spray then turns red untill air is clean and you noticed parts of the house that had dust everywhere that you don't have to clean that much. I would get one right away

I've purchased two of these replacements, and they perform on par with the original Winix filters, yet are much more affordable. You essentially receive three additional filters at no extra charge, compared to the single Winix filter priced at about $40. These filters excel at trapping dust and neutralizing smells. I have absolutely no issues with them and strongly endorse their use. My model is the Winix 5500-2, which comes with a remote control.

This is a perfect replacement filter that fits and performs just as good as the original manufacturer's replacement filter, at a much lower cost.  Highly recommended.

I was concerned about the filters being the correct size since there are other reviews that stated they were too small or too large and/or damaged. My filters are Perfect!! Packaged in 2 boxes which kept them safe from damage and they fit my Winix to a T. Thanks to this seller; will buy from them again.

I purchased the product without realizing that it fills 100% of the carbon filter. Better than OEM and another manufacturers replacement set I recently purchased.

I've previously always ordered the OEM filters and wanted to compare these against them given the price to see if they measure up.For the carbon filter, the plastic frame appears identical to the OEM version.  As described in the description there is a lot more carbon pellets in this product.  Visually it looked like each hexagon had about 50% more pellets.  I used a kitchen scale and found that the OEM filter weighed 681 grams and this product weighed 943 grams - 38% heavier. I did notice that the mesh appeared to be a slightly tighter weave than the OEM.For the HEPA filter, the construction appears identical -- same size, same number of pleats, and same number and placement of vertical seams.  The fabric appears slightly different and the printing of the air flow direction is different.  But overall the filter visually appears similar to the OEM filter.My OEM filter was purchased 8 months ago so there could be some changes in one bought today.  But ultimately it looks like these replacement filters are similar quality and construction, and has even more carbon.  This could potentially restrict air flow a bit but I use mine to absorb pet odors near a cat box and am happy to have a little less airflow through the filters if it absorbs more odors.

Replacing our old filters was quick and easy, fits perfect

great product

Some reviews say that it has fitment problems - this is false. This filter is actually better than the original and there is no performance degradation. Recommend this product

It's it's my purifier like a glove to a hand OEM specifications at a fraction of the price

Arrived within 2days

We run two Winix air purifiers on our glass porch whenever we're out there. After buying "the best" and being hugely under impressed, I ordered the first Winix for less than a third of what "the best" cost. We have a resident cigar smoker here--so an underperforming purifier left me gasping and smelling like a tavern. What a difference! How I wish we'd started out with a Winix--or two! We were so impressed, I immediately ordered another for the other end of the room (where I sit). Of course, the filters have to be changed more often than those used in a non-smoking environment. Having two--their brand-name set would be pricey. This set comes with the paper (non-washable) filter and the charcoal prefilter--but not the original gauzy washable pre-pre-filter. When I smell smoke on the porch, I wash the pre-pre- and the pre--and we're back to fresh air. When the paper filter gets brown, time to order more. A tip here--save the charcoal pre-filter for when you wash the current pre-filter because you should not put in it back in wet. When you wash it the first time, a lot of charcoal dust goes down the drain--once it rinses without a tinge of black, it will smell like new. It would be fabulous if the paper filter were washable--but then I guess it wouldn't be a hepa filter. When I write reviews, I try to be honest about whether I would buy an item again if it quit working for whatever reason. I would purchase the Winix (the model with the remote--which will work on however many you have) and these discount filters.

Came in a double protective box and fit just perfect

These filters fit my air purifier perfectly and extremely inexpensive!!

These filters compare favorably with the original/official Winix filters. No substantial difference in quality, same size/thickness. They don't include the black part of the filter set, but given that I've never found the carbon to make that big a difference, I really couldn't care less. Leave the existing black part in place (since it has to be there for the filter to operate correctly) and move on, happy with your savings. The official sets are a fortune! Will buy again when needed.

Lasts the 12 mos for us and we have a dusty house and animals. This is the second time ordering this product. I recommend it.

Exact fit air filter. Great air cleaning.

Needed replacement ordered this brand it was perfect fit, no smell worked just as good as original. We are very happy with purchase and would buy again for sure.  It’s been working great ever since we replaced. No Problems, Great Quality

This is the second set of these filters. They are as good or better than the ones that came with the original unit

Update: they were quick to remedy this situation. I got new filters within the same week in perfect condition. Will buy from them continually ✨Original complaint: I love this system but I’m very disappointed with the carbon filter. How does something like this make it past inspection?? Can’t help but wonder if it will damage my air purifier. Guess I’ll find out soon enough..

Was a perfect fit

Comes with both items pictured. Easily installed and fit perfectly for my purifier as listed in the description. My winix purifier started running more quietly once I installed the new filter. I can definitely tell the difference. Only comes with one set. These are cheapest filters available at the time I purchased. I don't see any difference between the filter that came with my purifier and the one I received online. I can usually replace mine every 3 months but that is just me. If your device is running loudly I recommend changing your filter.

These filters are great with filtration and airborne particles.  Very satisfied.

These are great…a friend gifted me their Winix 5500 air purifier when they moved out of state but the filters definitely needed to be replaced.These fit perfectly in my Winix 5500, exactly the same size as the originals…no gaps, HEPA filter just as tightly corrugated as the stock and as mentioned in many reviews the carbon filter seemed to have more carbon particles.Reading some review here I thought I might see some carbon dust initially when turning the unit on but there was none.The Winex doesn’t seem to be running harder/louder with the more filled carbon filter.Excellent product!  Will buy again when I need it!

Great!

Same specifications as the original filters at a much better price. I highly recommend.

They do the job. They purify the air good. I'm going to order more. No department store has them. I knew Amozon did because they have anything you need😊

Popped it in. It filters.

These served as a great replacement. The charcoal filter weighs more and visibly contains much more material than the OEM filter and the second filter was in no way visibly different. Has been working just as well as the original filter, but much cheaper. Hoping for a sale where we will stock up.

Went out of the country for a month while using the purifiers frequently through third party while gone. When returned they were covered in mildew and dust and contaminants that were shooting out the top since it was so covered. The sound immiting was a loud obnoxious sounds that only came from this style filter. And it's now one week to late to return and I just got back into country. I am hoping this company does right and either sends proper replacement or offers refund otherwise 1 star

After careful consideration, I do not trust that this replacement filter will work properly. The replacement air filter (has a blue frame) is too loose and does not actually fit well into my Holmes HAP9413 air purifier. it falls forward when I close the unit and stand it upright.  I don't think that the air purifier works right because of this. Also, the smaller black carbon filters included do not adhere in any way and fall off immediately when placed as directed onto the air filter. When I close the front door of the air purifier over the carbon filter and air filter and stand the unit upright, the black carbon filter does not stay in place. It falls off as soon as you move the purifier. I am very disappointed in this product. In the future, I will buy only authorized replacement filters from Holmes, the manufacturer..

These are direct replacement filters for my unit and they fit yes, but loose as heck. They do nit create a good seal on the back side so dust goes around them. They work but not well. Sorry for honesty.

Have not installed filter because they are ruined. I opened mail box to find torn paper bag holding crushed filters. Looked like had been dropped from a plane.

This is how they arrive - there’s no packaging so they get smushed in transit. Terrible quality better off buying the real Holmes for ten dollars more.

I bought it because I needed to change my filters. 1 month after I used it my air purifier stop working for no reason. It never happened before and my purifier is actually 6 months old. I’m so frustrated and upset that this happened to my purifier.

Thought this would work. It doesn’t. I will not buy again.

Very disappointed. The filters have a scent like Febreze - so I am returning. I do not want scented air purifiers, which is a oxymoron.

It came damaged.

They were too small for the model I ordered them for. Specifications stated they’d for my model. Not happy.

The size is way off even though the model number was correct.

Garbage

I bought this filter 2-pack because I couldn't find the original factory filters anywhere at the time of my order and the price seemed reasonable.This wasn't the bargain I'd hoped for. As others have pointed out, the filter paper is clearly not anywhere near the quality of the factory filter. It appears air can bypass the pleated paper where it meets the plastic frame. Over time the inside of the machine will get dirty and need to be disassembled and cleaned out. Not an easy task.It also was shipped in the same box with a holiday gift (a blu-ray box set) which would of been fine, but the filters were in a plastic bag with no box of their own so the pleats were pretty dinged up.I will most definitely pass on this one next time and find a better option.

These have about half the pleats of the Filtrete filter it replaced, which means the filter has a lot less surface area.  So for about half the price you get about half the filter, not exactly a good deal. Less surface area also means the filter won't have as much flow and will lose flow faster as it gets clogged. You're not saving anything by getting these instead of name brand filters.

The plastic frame of the filters have what is presumably a mounting tab for some make(s) of air purifier, however it is not removable and had to be cut off in order for it to fit in my Filtrete machine. One filter had some loose pleats due to an inconsistent adhesive job, though I don’t believe it will affect filtering ability. The black carbon filters lay on top without any means of affixation, but they work better than any other I have tried as far as the filtering of odors! The filters have been in use for over a week and are functionally sound, but are apparently of inconsistent quality, and a bit of a pain to install due to their design.

Don’t buy unless you like wasting money and time.

These are cheap. I found that the filters do not work well. They do not mask the smell. When entering room and machine is off You can smell the dirty filter. This is only after 1 week of use.

Can’t find the name brand filters anymore, so tried these. They are very cheaply made and don’t hold up well. It didn’t last nearly as long as the name brand filters and is super flimsy.

Although these stated they were for my particular air filter, I had to cut a hole in the carbon filter to fit over the dial on the inside.  There is a strange whistling sound coming from my air filter when it is running, both before I cut the hole and after.  They do not fit and conform to the unit.  They are separate and you have to attach it to the other filter and it doesn't work when placing it inside the unit.  So strange.  Sadly this one is in my bedroom so I use it at night.  No way I can stand that sound when trying to sleep!

The product description and graphics should have been my first red flag when getting these filters.They fit my machine but the "activated charcoal" black filters are just plastic, and a lot lower quality than the original.They just don't seem like they do the job, I'd go for something a little more expensive and higher quality.

Certainly no where near the quality of the original quality, I thought they would have been tighter. Almost ripped just removing from packing

Product Description states filter is compatible with Holmes HAP9415 but prefilter does not fit - too small.

These are nice to have. However our came all dented. No box for them. Only a plastic wrap. Interesting!!

The filter itself is just a loose placed piece of Z fold filter material. It almost fell out when I installed it. Pfft

The filter material… flimsy and bent out of shape. And you can’t push it back in The shape its supposed to be in

The filters themselves fit well. The black charcoal pieces are too small so don’t fit properly.

Not as good as previous versions of the same filter.  I was disappointed but have no alternative, so I have to use them.

I didn't have anything heavy combined with this shipment so this was likely mishandled. I think it should still work ok, but I wish it had had some cardboard layer to protect it instead of just plastic wrap to prevent this

I was happy to order these, but they were out of place. I had to try to straighten the filter paper myself.

Filters were of inferior quality wanna order from this company again

The charcoal filter pads did not fit properly. They didn't come with (predrilled) mounting holes for the top and bottom tabs, and they weren't long enough to extend to the bottom ones. So I created my own top mounting holes and it seems to hang fine without attaching to the bottom tabs. The cartridge itself seems to work fine but sometimes I hear a little rattle.

the foam pieces did not cover the whole area

The Hepa filters are identical to the Bionaire Hepa filters and fit well. The charcoal filters do not work at all. My Bionaire has 1 long filter. These filters are too short and too narrow. Now I have to look for the charcoal filter.

Filters seem to be decent but shipped loosely wrapped in plastic so the outer one had the filter material crushed and pulled away from the plastic frame. That one isn't going to filter much with basically a big hole in one end.

The filter fits but the carbon booster filter is very stiff. I won't return this product because it will do for now but I wouldn't purchase it again. Spend a little more and purchase a better product.

Filters were the same as what came with the air purifier. These are sent in a plastic bag and are not boxed though and one was damaged when it was delivered. Have had really good service with these filters in cleaning the air and eliminating any odors.

The folds in the filter material are all messed up. There’s little grooves in the sides of the plastic that the folds are supposed to sit in but many are popped out and I can’t get them back in. But the air purifier still works, I’m just not sure if it works as well with the wrinkly parts.

This was suggested as a replacement filter. I bought it because at the time the price was lower, however, it doesn't fit and the return window has closed.

They DO NOT fit Holmes HAP2415. They seem like they would be decent filters if they fit right. I have mine just sitting in the purifier without being attached. :(

The white filters fit my Holmes machine, but not the black filters. Good price.Item arrived dented in some areas. Tried to move with my fingers to fix it, but it didn’t work.

The filters are great, but the foam filter does not fit.

One of the filters looked like it had been crunched. Going to use it - too much of a hassle to send it back.

There worth the money but it would have been nice if they weren't smashed need to wrap them somehow

A OK

My purchase was for 2 hepa filters and 4 carbon filters. I received only the hepa filters. They appear to be well constructed and fit my AER1. 3 Stars for that. However there was a cheaper option if that was all I wanted. I paid for the carbon filters because I also want to filter out odor.

They were the best I could get for my pocket book

the filter fit, but the black carbon screen are cut to small.

It came with slight damage on the filters.

missing the 4 screens

Just ok. Nothing dpecial

It’s been four days, and I’ve complained to my boyfriend that I couldn’t feel the difference in the air like j could with the original filter when I bought it, like you could SEE stuff going in before, now I can’t see or feel it, but you can see on the filter it’s obviously collecting stuff, so I don’t know. Maybe it’s just like over time ware, your product starts giving up lol

Do not recommend.

Pleated filter fits fine. As good as original.Washable filter does not fit but can be cut to fit.Good value but disappointed in the washable filter.

Filters worked but just a little smaller then the Aero1 brand. You can't beat the price though.

I have a lot of dust in my so home so Scratch, scratch bad were I have to cover my glasses with plastic. The filter really trap a lot dusk, and not mention I two dogs that shed Extremely large amount of air.  It’s a great price as well. Love it

Very convenient from Amazon. Fast shipping!

This product arrived quickly, fit the application well. It seems to be a good product. Time will tell.

Great value and fits our air purifier perfectly! I’m only giving it 4 stars because due to packaging, one of the filters got a little dented and I had to fit it prior to installation.

Exactly as described

These were alright for my needs. The filters themselves fit well, though took a bit of maneuvering to get them to click into place. They definitely do their job of filtering dust and hair from the air. However, the carbon inserts are not great. They don’t fit the grate on the purifier at all. It took some creative positioning to make it work at all and I still don’t have it all the way to the top as there is no opening for the circle part. Even still, it was worth the money.

Perfect fit

Carbon filter booster was too small,used to purify my bedroom

Arrived on time, no damage aside from one little corner being a little warped on one of the pieces but it doesn't hinder the job and install was easy. Will order more when needed.

Fit my Holmes perfectly and the price was right. Am pleased with my purchase.

I am satisfied with the product. It’s a perfect fit to the air purifier I have. Will buy it again!

Generic version of air filter.  Seems to work, fit the unit, hoping it filters like it supposed to.

It fits, it does what it needs to do, and the fact that I was able to get same day delivery made this pretty awesome. My housemate’s purifier hadn’t been changed in a LONG time and this made the unit run so much quieter.

Only issue was the carbon filter did I not cover the entire back screen. They were a bit short in length.

Found one of my older air cleaners and needed to replace the filters. These were just what I was looking for. Helps with the wild fire smoke that comes in when exiting and entering the house and when the dog goes in and out.

The Filter Replacement for Holmes Air Purifiers work well! I used it during some forest fires when the air quality was really bad and the filter seemed to really work. The main filters fit perfectly and effectively for my 'Holmes aer1 HAP9241'. Only complaint was with the carbon booster filters. It's unclear where and how they should be installed, resulting in a minor fluttering sound.

Everything comes in individual packaging which is great to ensure everything is clean. Filter fills a little flimsy and is not as hard as other filters I’ve used. However after running the air filter it cleans the air very well. It says filter will last about a year and comes with extra charcoal filters so we will see. Would purchase again

Fits & work well. I just prefer the orginal 1 piece blk filter that came with machine instead of one for each individual filter. But they still work great

Noticably better

Pro: it's cheap and it worksCon: poor quality control. the filter fabric arrived partially unglued from the filter and required some time to get back into the frame. I recommend using a pen or something to poke it back into the /\/\/\/\ shaped sides that the filter is originally attached to.

They do the job, but they’re not as good hepa certified, but for the price it’s good

Great price!

Same as my current filter, however, charcoal filter smaller the it should be.Does not cover all of vents.

Fits like it was suppose to seems to be just like the original one

Seriously needs better packaging, mine always arrive crushed! (Filter parts, not the frames).

Works very well and cost is very good

Can't beat this price. The other filters wanted twice amount of money for two filters. Definitely will order more

Fit the purifier

Great filters

It fits the requirements, however,it would had been better if the charcoal filter came in one piece

The quality is not as good as the OEM

Work good

The black little filters are to small. I used the big filters but the original little black filter or whatever it’s called.

black filter too small, used for cigarette smoke

Definitely easy to install.  Filter did come slightly damaged but not enough for it to not work; you get what you pay for. Not protected on a box (sellers box); just put in an Amazon bag.

If you need furnace duct filters these are pretty good for the price. They fit good and seem to do what they are intended to do filter air.

Works great

The product is good as far as I know just started using the air purifier since I go the refill.

I got this filter mostly for the price. It does fit into my old air filter I bought years ago, I don't notice too much of a difference in air quality/fragrance, then again who constantly checks that... So yeah. It does seem to work in terms of filtering air, and catching dust/etc.

You get two filters. The element seems flimsy next to the Aer1 or other filters in that family. But for the price, that’s ok.

Large white and blue filter fits but black thin filter does not fit.

filters fit fine, but the black "things' that came with it did not..

No problem and very good price

easy to work and installation.

I bought these replacement filters twice now because of the new HEPA filter I have for our apartment at home. You can really tell the difference in the air after you use them!

The reason I kept buying from this vendor in the past are based on quality of the filters.My recent purchase is $5 increased in the price and filters are not as good as previous purchases. It still fit in my machine.

Wasn’t exactly the same size as the filter that came with my Holmes air purifier.

Works great. Fits perfectly in air purifier

I bought these filters in bulk and Amazon has a great price for them. I use these in three different air purifiers in the house. No complaints here.

Thrifted my purifier and needed new filters. They fit perfectly!

Produt met my expectations. Perfect fit fir my air purifier and reasonably priced

Filters for perfect and came with additional filters. Works great

These replacement filters do an excellent job of eliminating dust and odors from the environment.  The price is reasonable, they are easy to install, and they are durable.

These work perfectly in my filter and I will order more.

The carbon pre-filters don't have a way to stay in place in front of the HEPA filters.I had to had glue the edges of the pre-filters to the hepa filters for proper functioning of my Holmes air purifier.Other buyers will have the same issue.

We have used these filters for about 1 year, we find them excellent for taking out those items you don't want floating around.

The filters were exactly what i expected. air feels fresh & clean.

I bought a small Holmes air cleaner several years ago. The filters are no longer sold locally. I’m very happy that I can still order them on line. The fit was perfect.

Very good

The product came quickly and it fits my machine perfectly

Just what I needed for my Holmes Air Purifier. Thank you.

I like that I got exactly what I ordered.

Works very well

It was accurate

These two packs for my Holmes Air Purifier are a perfect fit! It even comes with black carbon filters. Make sure to follow the instructions on which direction to install it. If you are not careful, it is easy to install it backwards, and it will not shut properly if so.

The filters came a day early, and were exactly as described.

Fits and works great!

Works perfectly in my Holmes tower air cleaner

These filters are looking brand new, I will breathe better.

These fit well on my purifier, they seem to be doing a good job

I change my filters every 3-6 mos.  They definitely make a difference and work great.  I smoke so my air cleaner is often turned up to a 3 and when I check the unit its obvious it cleans well and collects dust etc from the air.

Still works 8 months later!

Great fit & works great.

Loved ease of replacing and also not having to run out to stores to find more filters when it's time to change them!

This filter fits my Holmes AER air purifier perfectly for much more than half the price, and you get 2 with 4 of the charcoal filters!  Such a great deal, wish I would have found this deal a long time ago!

Well made

Great price for the need of my machine, the small filter last about 3 months

I wanted to try a filter for my Holmes Aero and this air filter fits perfectly and works great

These are replacement filters for the air purifier in our bedroom.  The name brand ones are over 2x as much.  These are just as good and do a great job!

Perfect fit and priced way better than in the store.

A great deal on filters. Nicely packaged. Prompt delivery.

the value for this product is very good. It is very easy to install. I have this air cleaner at work  and let it run on low 24/7. At times I would come in early morning and there is a slight unpleasantness about the air quality in the room

Fits and has the charcoal filter included.  Will buy more

fits my machines well.  great price

These filters were purchased for routine change every 3 to 5 months for room air filter machines.

Fits the holmes air purifier hap9423 perfectly and has done a great job cleaning up my bedroom air. Waking up with clear sinuses again is nice.

Works great!

They work well.  Can watch the cig smoke pull right to thru it working its magic

Easy to change out, good value. I keep ordering more

Easy to install in my AER1 desktop air purifier, but cost was a little higher than expected for simple paper filters.  Good quality though.

Yep, seems good to me. It looks like you have to cut the black pre-filter thing to size, but that sounds like a normal thing with the fact this is a semi-universal fit kinda deal.I run the air filter just about constantly in my room and so far it seems like it’s doing just as good with this filter as the first one that was in it.Honestly, I can’t tell if my air filter really does anything or if it’s more of a piece of mind kind of device. I definitely see there is dust accumulated on the filter side, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I would recommend to you reading this (and myself) to go watch some YouTube tester videos to see what’s really happening and how effective these things are.

These are such a great buy. Hard to find these filters in brick and mortar anymore because they banned the machines that use them, well they did in California. Now the machines work just don’t use the ion button. Glad I was able to find these. OEM said change every 12 months but I change them every 6-9 months. Just a preference. Would def buy these filters again n.

We live in the desert Southwest, and spring is windy season so the air filter is used frequently. Wasn't sure these would fit but they did. Quality slightly better than what came with the original unit.

Seems to work. No complaints

High quality replacement HEPA filters and carbon pre-filters.  These fit and work great - just match the size of your OEM filter to these and your good to go.  Filter life has been excellent.  I have purchased this product multiple times.  I use these in both my office and bedroom, along with one in guest rooms.  Filters do their job.

works well in a dusty region. Easy to replace.

Updated review: At first I couldn't tell a difference between these replacement filters and others but they have been installed for about a month now and already need to be replaced (and its not poor air quality speeding up the process). I had bought another brand (Flintar) that lasted 5 months before getting these filters in February. You get what you pay for, I would suggest spending $5 more and going with the Flintar brand.

I noticed it felt and looked different from the original, but still was hopeful. The tab ripped right away. Junk. Not sure why these filters have such good reviews?

I don't usually write reviews but this definitely deserves one! These filters are the absolute worst! It made my whole house smell like pee and smoke and made us sneeze and cough like crazy. Cant afford to buy new ones so will have to just go without

the red light has been on since i installed these filters. not sure what that means.

Seemed to work but when I was trying to adjust the filter and pulled the tab, the filter ripped open, making it useless.

Hay fever doesnt lie. NOT hepa, NOT effective.after sneezing my way through the past week i inspected the thing, doesnt look much like the orginial, net texture is off, and when you hold it up to the light you see its a sham, see through to the other side, not like its supposed to be. This is not an effective filter for dust and dander.if you want a white noise machine, put this filter in

I bought these for me levoit lv h-128 which I purcased from Amazon in June 2023. My the start of October, the white light turned red. These replacement filters did not seem to work. Light is still red. Useless.

I have bought these for the past year with no issues, but this last batch, my throat is now suddenly sore. When I turn off the air purifier, it goes away. Guess the quality went down.Bought a different brand and replaced these. Now I have no issues. Won't be buying again and don't recommend.

I noticed when changing the filter, it seemed to have expanded and tore apart in the machine.  When I went to replace them with the second pair, they were also too tight!

Does not work on purifier, red light will not turn green, although it seems to be the same exact filters that came with purifier.  I do not recommend

The red light is still no air purifier

Item not as described; was incorrect size replacement.

They didn't work with the unit described in the title.  No compatible at all. Don't buy.

Not comparable with the product it says it does

Doesn’t capture as much, better off going with the expensive brand one.

I trusted the high reviews for these replacement filters for my Levoit air purifying unit. Unfortunately, they are not like the ones that came with the actual unit, that can easily be pulled up by the pull tab.I had to apply force to get it into the unit it was that snug.  Which made me wonder if I could pull it back out with the tab, so I tried, and the tab came right off, remaining jammed in my machine.  I could not grab it out with my fingers.  So I had to find something to extricate it (which ended up being the metal emery board on my fingernail clippers that I had to jab into the end put much force into moving it upwards and out).I decided to try the other filter I had also opened to see if it was also snug, and it too was very snug, so I didn't force it all the way down.I personally would not recommend these.I see there are a couple other listings by other off brands claiming to also fit this unit, but I'm not sure I want to take the chance on having a similar experience.  I guess I will just pay the extra money for the real filters.I will now have to ask Amazon if I can send them back for a refund, even though I opened 2 of the 4 filters.

I don't think it is working properly. I usually had quite some dust on the original ones when thé device was working for a while, but with these ones, it looks too clean.. and the button stays red like if there was a problem.I do not recommand.

filters did not last long

not good and cheap product, far away from the original

It’s ok

FYI:  This is NOT a 6 pack as stated on the product page. It is a 3 pack because you will need 2 filters, not one., for each air filter, every month.I think the seller should have to say that on the product page. It's very misleading.There seems to be some  price gouging on these filters right now as the price keeps climbing.I have a large hepa filter for the the upstairs in my house. I do not have to change the hepa as often as the charcoal filer -- but for the four air filters I bought for the other two floors, I have to buy a hepa and a charcoal filter for each one, every month. And it costs $40 a month to buy the set of filters.While this air purifier works great -- you can tell by the filters when you change them that they are cleaning the air. I just wished I would have checked the cost of running them. Two larger filters probably would have been a more economical buy.

They are ok. Cheaper option but they don't work as good as official filters.

These are aftermarket and do not pick up dust and lint as good as the original ones.

They don't last long at all and are extremely high priced for filters  but until I find a better option I'm stuck with it

You get what you pay for, definitely recommend buying the levoit ones.

It is just like the one from levoit, authentic and works quietly.

These don’t last as long as the brand name filters but they’re still worth it. These last about 5-6 weeks in my house, the brand name ones only last about two weeks longer and are double the price so it makes buying these much more worth it financially and they work just as good in my opinion.

Thinner than expected (but then the slot for them is narrow) but, they do the job.

Excellent product

These filters look exactly the same, but smaller in size than what I need for my model. I made a mistake and have to return these.

The product is compatible with my  Air purifier; however, It is very charcoal heavy and your hands become black just from touching it making it harder to clean it.

It fits really snug in the unit but overall it worked to filter the air in the house.

Left off for a few days and saw the difference in odor and dust settled in the room

No info with product

cant go wrong. these fit great, a great price. work great. all around i love these. i always get excited when i break out a new clean white one. i will continue to buy these for my replacement filters :)

These are really good value as replacement filters. They seem like there's quality made and they do a great job. Much less no cost than buying the name brands plus you get enough to last you for quite a while.

They fit perfectly. Air is much nicer now.

Although these are not made by the actual manufacturer of the air machine I have, they are working great so far.

Perfect fit filters work great

I have been using these to filter smells and dust from my cat's litter box and it has been working wonderfully. No issues so far and it keeps my home smelling clean and fresh.

Good replacement filters, fit perfect.

Ordered these as replacement’s for the original, so far so good!

Good replacement filters good value

They do an excellent job and remember to vacuum them every month.  Totally worth the money.

Good stuff

Perfect fit for my levoit small air purifier, good value

I love these better 🗣️

These cost half the price as the official ones and work just as well.

Just as advertised - replacement filter. Arrived in a tiny box and contains 4 packs.

Love the product . Have ordered these filters several times. Great value.

These are just as good as the brand name filters but a fraction of the cost!

I bought a six pack because it's a great price. These fit my LEVOIT Air Purifiers.It also happens they are a near perfect fit for the rectangle opening for the outside intake air of my AC closet. I placed the two side by side and they were about 3/4 of an inch narrow. So I cut 3/4 inch shim to take up the space. My vent provides oxygenated air, but also pollen and other smutz. I have two water proof 12v fans on a timer. Previously, I was using single layer register filters that are little better than a paper towel. These LV-H128 three stage charcoal activated filters are a big improvement. Already, the air from the registers smells cleaner. When the door for the closet starts help latch itself, it's time to change the filter.Along with my LEVOIT Air Purifiers in my bedroom and office, I hope my dusting/vacuum chores will lighten. I'm a terrible housekeeper.

I was having trouble finding replacement filters for my air purifier from where I originally purchased it. I came on Amazon and bought a four pack and they are the same exact ones that the manufacturers website wanted more money for. All in all Amazon saved me money on this purchase. Great pick!

These filters work very well. Just look at the pic, This was after 4 months in my son’s college studio apartment. He said he can breathe better and he’s not stuff the next day. We leave the filtration run 24/7.  We’re going to replace every 2 months and then evaluate. Every situation I’m sure will be different. But these filters work,

I love when they have a sale on these. I use the year round and it not super expensive.

It fits in the Levoit H128, and it visually looks pretty darn close to what filters came with my Levoit. The functional parts look the same, maybe the pull ribbon looks a little different, but from the macro-visual level, it all checks out. If we're all getting scammed and it's not a HEPA filter or charcoal infused or whatever they say....well damn, at least they made a convincing looking product :)But you guys who are complaining that changing out the filter didn't reset the light.... You guys.... You have to reset the light yourself. It's not the filter's fault...For my machine at least, when the machine is off but plugged in and the light is red, you reset the light by press-holding the button for like 10 seconds and then the red light should turn off. But you gotta do that yourself, don't be deducting stars just because you didn't read the owner's manual.

Perfect fit. Does what it’s supposed to do!

I was a little worried because it wasn't from the original seller but fit perfectly

These fit and work with my small air purifiers. Exactly what I needed!

Super easy to install. Great replacement

I’m extremely happy with my purchase.

I purchased the filter replacements to help eliminate dust, pet hair, and other allergens. Does a great job! Will continue to purchase.

A For Awesome!!!

Works as it should. I bought the actual air filter a bit over 6 months ago, and these replacements seem to be slightly different than the ones that came originally. I noticed light passes less through these, they smell a bit different, and the fan seems quieter. I dunno.To reset the red light, press and hold the little touch button for 3 ish seconds, it’ll turn off.

These have a horrible odor. Im sure it will dissipate but it has a chemical smell. It's been a few hours and still smells.If you hold a name brand replacement filter up toward light you can't see light through the filter material. These I can see straight through them.These are no where near the same filtering capacity as the original. I will buy the original name brand next time which will probably be soon.These just don't have as much filter material so you change it more often. The OEM filter last 4 months in a smokers office. I give this one a month maybe 6 weeks before replacing will be needed.

I had to stop using these. They smelt so bad. Just say no.

I don't know if I got a different product than other reviewers or maybe I have a more discerning eye; but what I received greatly differed from the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) filter. Before I even got the iSingo out of the plastic protection I could tell the mesh on the outside had about double the openess/weave, was loose fitting, and had a very thick doubled (tripled?) up seam. As this is the first layer of protection it's not going to work as well as the OEM. I took pictures of both and you can see for yourself. You can barely see the seam and openess of the mesh on the OEM. I had to feel all the way around the OEM to even find the seam, whereas the seam and mesh openess sticks out visually and tactically on the iSingo. Overall, the quality of construction was lesser then the OEM as well. However, the inner black charcoal filter did look about the same.You get what you pay for when trying to save a buck!

Due to a sickening chemical smell, these are completely useless. Why would I believe this is filtering the air if it smells like that? If anything it's making the air quality worse.

Horrible plastic smell to the point I thought the unit was on fire. Went back to an original filter, and it solved the problem.

I am a little disappointed by the quality of these filters. The outer screen holes are much larger than original and poorly constructed overall. And this is what I can see on the outside. I feel that these are just cheaply made with no intent to meet original filtering capabilities...just that it fits the purifier and even then, I've lost trust that it fits correctly to seal and clean the air.I will not buy this again.

The filters were supposed to fit my model air filter and they do not fit.

I purchased the product expecting authenticity, but it turned out to be a disappointing knock-off. The quality was subpar, and it's clear that it lacks. Save your money and look for originals from Levoit.

These filters let very little air through. They are so restrictive i am worried about them damaging the filter unit.  I am planning on replacing these asap.

Got my 2 pack and ran both of my machines, within an hour house smelled like burning plastic from these filters. Not sure what changed but previously it never did this they must have changed materials. I had to turn machines off to stop the headache my household was getting from these.

Doesn’t filter nearly as well as OEM and is smaller. Disappointed but get what you pay for

Cheap and for filter it does not look well made compared to original

After getting filter could not get filter light to go off, I cleaned inside, unplugged, etc.  I even sent email to Levoit and have yet to receive any response.  Light still on.

My filter light won't turn off anymore since I installed this product.

I recently purchased these replacement filters for my air purifier, and I have to say, my experience has been quite disappointing. After about a month and a half of use with the first filter, I noticed a very strong burning smell coming from the purifier. Concerned, I decided to replace it with another filter, hoping for better results. However, just two weeks later, a subtle burning smell started to emit from the machine again.To troubleshoot, I removed both filters and ran the air purifier without them. Interestingly, there was no burning smell at all during this test, which makes me suspect that the filters are the source of the problem.Based on my experience, I cannot recommend these filters. They simply don’t perform well. I’d suggest going for the branded filters from Levoit instead; I used one of theirs for six months with zero issues and no unpleasant odors. Save yourself the trouble and stick with the reliable option!

I purchased this a while ago and after some time in the filter I smelled a burning smell. I ended up replacing the actual air filter unit thinking it was the machine. After a replacement unit, the filters still smelled like burning.Against better judgement I ordered these again a second time hoping that the first set was defective. Again, the set of filters emit a burning smell.Save your money and buy the real filter

I bough these filters to substitute the old one in the purifier because the red icon appeared. Model is same. Does not work. The purifier shows a red light still to change the filter.

bought these filters, thinking they were equivalent.  they are not.  waste of moneythey emit a burnt plastic smell, especially after a long run of the levoit 200s.  we thought it was the air purifier electronics, and bought a 2nd 200s.  turns out it is these filters.threw them both out and ordered levoit brand filters.

As mentioned by others, the quality of these filters is below that of the original manufacturer filters.The outside mesh has visibly larger opening, which means larger dust particles can enter the HEPA filter (if it even is a true HEPA filter) and thus shorten the life of the filter.I can only assume the rest of the filter is also of lower quality.An immediate return in my book.It's worth paying the extra money for the OEM filter.

These filters emits a chemical odour which makes me  nauseous.The original filters did not have this issue and were amazing. In the garbage. Live and learn.

Needed a more affordable version of the Hepa filters and these have been perfect. They work great, size fits perfectly in our levoit air purifiers throughout the house. And they cling on and hold to the dust and particles making change out of the filters a breeze!

I was initially skeptical about trying these Levoit air purifier filter replacements, but I’m so glad I did! They are just as effective as the name brand version, but at half the price. These filters last just as long and do the trick perfectly, keeping the air in my home clean and fresh. If you’re looking for a cost-effective alternative without compromising on quality, these filters are the way to go. Highly recommended!

I have 2 Husky's so ton of dandruff and poor air quality, therefore a must for a purifier in my bedroom. These are far cheaper than name brand but work just as well.

The filters fit perfectly, came in a package of 3 for the air purifier, well packaged, and cost half of what the company was charging.  A win-win!

Great price for two filters

Perfect fit. Look like they are made by the original manufacturer. Perfect copy. Probably come out of the same factory. Still expensive for what they are, even though they are about half the price of the originals.

Performance seems on par to the OEM filter, with a Great price and value!

good replacement filter, the prefilter mesh is like the original.

Works great just what I ordered with fast delivery

I’ve always bought the brand name filters in the past, but I wanted to figure out a more cost effective solution. These really are just as good as the brand name filters, highly recommend!

Inexpensive and does the job

Fit was perfect, can’t tell if the filter is as good as the original but so far seems to be working fine.

We have the machine in a room with an automated littler machine/box for 2 kittens and this keeps the air machine humming along and the air clean and fresh.  Keep up on your schedule and the machine doing its job with these filters.😁😁

Needed a replacement filter for my Levoit Core 200S air purifier, but didn't want to have to pay through the nose for a replacement from Levoit. Saw these filters on amazon and they had a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give them a try.  They are just as good as the Levoit OEM filters, build and use. I got two (2) pet filters rather than just one for the same amount of money. I won't need a replacement filter for quite some time now, but when I do, I hope these are still available! Great product, A+++!

Great filters. Do the job!

The filters look exactly like the originals

There is no reason to spend more on the levoit branded one. You can’t really tell the difference between this one and the original besides the branding stamped on the plastic.

They work as advertised. It is a great product. Highly recommend it for those folks that want to breathe cleaner air at home.

No problems what so ever

Great value for these filters, highly recommend this

They fit perfectly!

The product is excellent

Great

The filters have been doing fine so far.  Air is fresh with no problems.

I thought i would like these for my master bathroom. I ordered 2 of the 16" sets for both sides of our sink, 1 30" set for the over the toilet and a 36" set for over the tub. Upon receiving them, I was surprised at how well packed they were. I did think the 36" shelves were damaged by the damage on the vox, but they engineered the packaging nicely to prevent damage to the product.Onto my one and only victim, the 16" set. The moment I removed the cellophane,  I knew it was incredibly cheaply made. So cheap in fact that I didn't even want to continue. But onward I went. I wanted to see what was inside these holes so I got my trusted scope to see how hollow this thing really is. It's nothing more than a corrugated box that they finished on the outside!Looking at the bracket, once you fought to get it out, you can see that the 1/16" thick (if that) material would collapse if the slightest indent would form.On the 36" model the bracket is 18" long. I don't know how they knew the builders of my home, but somehow they managed to make the centers between the holes 15"! EXACTLY WHAT MY BUILDERS PROBABLY DID! No kidding. What were they thinking? Why did they not even bother to try and get at least one hole from both inserts to be 16" on center? Okay, I get it. Some walls are 24" But still, really?? The other thing is, this shelf is nearly 4 1/2lbs. If the limit is 25lbs and they say you can put towels, jars, plants, etc on this thing, sorry, this thing is coming down, QUICKLY! There's this thing called stress, fatigue, and oh right, forgetfulness.  One day one of these these things will kick in and kaRash!These are the times I'm glad I own a sealing machine. Out to the garage I go to vacuum seal it up and return all these sets immediately!  I'll put my money into something a bit more pricey perhaps made out of PARTICLE BOARD!

I was super excited to get these installed in my bathrooms. I ordered 3 sets of them. They were all crooked. They looked fine at first glance, but when we pulled the metal rigging out we realized it was not straight. We thought it might be an error on our end and went to install one, but as we slid the shelf on, it was sticking up! The back wasn't even flush against the wall. We opened the second package and it was also crooked and uneven! I didn't even bother with the third at that point. I was so disappointed. If the rigging was straight, they really would have been great. The color was like the picture, the measurements were great. I just can't put things on a shelf that is going to slide everything backwards.

Have zero confidence that this will not fall during the night.Feel cheap and the way they are supposed to be hung leaves much to be desired.

Not sturdy at all screw holes didn't line up. Hardware did not work at all , they were cheap. But I guess . you get what you pay for🤷‍♀️ no way I would put more then 2lbs on them.

Terrible quality, poor design. After installing it made my kitchen look worse than before since it won’t sit flush on the wall and the screws on the bottom of the shelf wouldn’t sink into the wood.

The description says the shelves can hold 25 lbs, maybe that's true if you distribute it across both the shelves or have them stacked on top of each other. These shelves are so flimsy I don't even trust them to hold more than 5 pounds. Just resting my hand on it, the shelf is bending and feels like it will pull out. The material is only a step above cardboard. Even if the short screws provided do hold in the wall, it's likely the "wood" will break well before you hit 25 lbs. It's probably fine for JUST toilet paper but I wouldn't put anything else on it.

If I could gives these zero stars I would. First the bar that supports the shelf is half the depth of the shelf. Second they want you to put SEVEN holes in the wall with anchors to support each shelf. The shelf itself weighs nothing. Third the anchors it came with are insanely cheap. The screws weren’t even catching the anchors and pulling it tightly. The wholes were not too big for the anchors, they were extremely snug. Since the screws would not catch the anchor there isn’t enough support and the shelf sags with only the weight of the shelf. I can’t take it down because I’ve got so many holes in the wall now. Do yourself a favor and buy a better quality shelf. This one is a good price point but you get what you pay for.

Shelf fell off wall after putting 10 pounds on it. Hardware that comes with the shelf if low quality. Had to go to home depot to get good wall attachment Hardware

No hardware was included.  The directions do state they’re included.  Irritated and might just return it.

I returned them because they were too long and wide. I was looking for something to look more like real wood and these looks fake. They are also too wide and come out of the wall too much so its easy for someone to hit them.

I do not recommend this purchase. The shelves are glorified hollow cardboard. For the most part I’m forgiving with low quality products, but I can actually apply pressure on the surface with my thumb and I see the cardboard bend in. Skip this product.

Ordered the 2 pack. Brackets that you slide the shelves into are not straight on both shelves, they're angled up. Seems to be an issue with this product. Amazing that numerous reviews say this, but the company doesn't address the issue. Must mean they don't care, that instead of fixing their process, they prefer to send a new set of brackets/shelves when the problem occurs. That means they don't care about the consumer.UPDATE: now that I have 20 holes drilled into my wall, I'm sort of committed to using this product. I ordered a replacement and they too are not level. The brackets are angled up. This is incredible honestly. I now ordered a 3RD SET (20 holes in my wall), but if this doesn't work out I'll need to find a new path. And there's no customer service number for this company. It's too bad, the shelves look nice, but they have some real quality control issues. DO NOT BUY.

While the shelves themselves are nice we only received half the hardware needed to hang the shelves. We had enough screws for one shelf and had to go to the hardware store to find and match the screws for the second one.

I did not like these shelves at all they were too short, they were very slippery. Things will slide all over easily, and could fall…, and they did not mount to my wall but at any rate they were cheap.

It’s just so cheap looking I wouldn’t hang this in my basement.

Can’t comment on how they look or sturdiness, since it came without all the parts needed to install.  Directions say 10 screws and 10 anchors. It only came with 6 each. I think 5 per shelf may be overkill so I can let that pass. However, you can’t connect the shelves to the brackets without the smaller screws, of which only 3 were received.  It also said parts included a level. Nope!Either I have to take the time to find a hardware store and BUY a screw or be inconvenienced with packing this all back up and returning. There’s not even an option to contact the seller because most likely, the product was listed by a reseller, so there’s no recourse.  So tired of this crap. Product quality and accountability aren’t even a part of buying on A anymore. (Can you tell I’m irritated?!)EDIT:: I read other reviews and yes, I did unpack everything, including the brackets. One bag with the contents from the pic is all there was.

It does not look the exact same and the picture that they have on here on Amazon once you get it, the quality is bad.

Looks nice until you touch it. Cheap and hollow and i wouldn’t trust it to hold anything more than a glass of milk

the bulit in slope not necsessary

Very cheap pressed wood

Had less than a year and the shelf material is cracking and falling apart. Shelf is hollow and made of cheap wood. Unhappy with purxhase. I don’t recommend product.

The corner of one of the shelves came damaged. Unfortunately I was outside of the return date so now I have shelves I can’t use.

The shelves look nice but they are not sturdy at all. I’m afraid they will break easily. I wish I could return them, but with all the holes already made I’ll keep them for now.

If you’re planning to put anything lighter than simple decor or towels you’ll need to buy heavier anchors. I bought these shelves for my laundry room and they all fell with the original ones.

I returned these and now months later Amazon is charging me again saying not returned, they need to keep up with returns I’m sick of spending hours on the phone with customer service

This thing weighs a gram and can support 8 pounds tops. The anchors and screws were suspiciously small but I didn’t expect something so flimsy.Perfect for Q tips and Kleenex but thats about it

Shelves are far from sturdy, can not hold 25 lbs - watch what you put underneath because they will fall

Don’t buy! Sadly I bought these shelves for a new home I was moving into, so I did not open the box tell after the return time passed. Install was easy if you have the tools, but one shelf arrived damaged which was not too bad I might have stilled used it. The biggest flaw is the bracket that holds the shelf up is tilted upwards and I didn’t notice until I put it up. Do not waste your money, so many others have reported the same thing wrong with these shelves and I should have read the 1 star reviews. And it’s not just one bracket it’s both that it came with!

These shelves look nice, but they are not level once you get them up on the wall. They angle upwards and I’m not sure this can be fixed. I am trying to contact their customer service but cannot find a contact.I ended up having to return the shelves, but not before putting 14 holes in my wall.

Super lightweight because it made from lowest quality, really worries when I put my Boom3 speakers on. Not recommended. Will not buy again. Not worth with that price.

I made sure I put it in a beam. Put about 2 pounds of stuff on it and it started wobbling.  Definitely won’t hold 25 pounds

Shelves made from printed particle board. Looks cheap. Originally bought for our office, but kept them and put them in our daughter’s room not anywhere with real high traffic. After hanging shelves, they sag. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone. You could stain real wood shelves for that price and have a much better quality but I was looking for something fast and easy. Lesson learned.

Very unhappy with these, they are suppose to hold up to 25lbs, I have about 3 pound on the bottom shelf, the top shelf only holds 3 towels. I did hang the bracket in a stud.

The quality was no where near other floating shelves I have purchased. Do not plan on putting too much weight on them.

We made sure that the screws were in studs & everything was leveled. Shelf is still leaning down.Nothing excessive is on it. Just a few pictures and some light decorations.Worried about putting anything breakable on it because it looks like it’s going to give out any second.Very disappointing with how much I paid.

I don’t like it the wood feels bad quality and doesn’t look nice wouldn’t recommend buying

It was cheap but I was hoping it wouldn't look THAT cheap. Yuck. Also, it requires you to put 7 screws for each shelf in your wall.

Unfortunately, these shelves came out of the box and almost immediately went into the trash. They are hollow. The mounting equipment and the shelves were cheap and almost impossible to install. After putting four holes in the wall and still being unable to install them properly, we finally decided to cut our losses and just throw them out. Had we been able to install them, I wouldn't have felt comfortable putting much on them because they were very narrow and weren't sturdy at all.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I have had these shelves up in my house for less than 60 days. I knew they were flimsy when I received them and my husband wanted me to return them but I gave them a shot. They droop and the bars that insert into the shelf have bent over what little time I had them. I’ve had less than 3 lbs on that shelf the entire time I had them and now they are useless. DO NOT BUY THESE! You will regret your purchase.

Cheaply made, complicated installation, small shelf but needed to make 3 holes in the wall…. Did not like it at all, and unfortunately too late to return, return window closed

They look okay but these will not last and are not priced right at all, $80 is outrageous for this. Would not recommend. Look elsewhere for a quality shelf.

These shelves are horrible! They sagg so bad I will be taking them down!!

The shelf will only properly support very light objects but unable to support my intended use without bowing. Advertised weight support should be communicated more precisely.

Instructions provided and design do not allow for sheetrock wall installation. Installation hardware inadequate. Repair of damaged wall required after attempted installation. Other, similarly priced shelves provide hardware and instructions for sheetrock wall installation. Returned this item and bought one of adequate design.

We installed 5 of these shelves to use in our bar area.  The very first day, one shelf ‘slanted’ forward (even though we had a professional handyman install them; he said their hardware was horrible).  We lost several bottles of very expensive bourbon.  We will be replacing them with better quality shelves that we can actually put glasses on and trust they won’t all get broken.  Move on from this one!

My husband installed these shelves in my son’s bedroom and the brackets that you slide the shelf onto are severely angled up. Thought maybe they would level off after the screws were in. No such luck.

The anchors included are a joke. There's no way these can hold a single pound, much less 25

The inside is hollow and constructed in such a way that the shelf even with improved hardware, does not sit level to the floor. Even when there is nothing on it. I got the white shelves, once I had all the holes in my wall I kept the shelf until I can replace it. Now that it's up, the skin or fake wood wrap, is separating as if the glue is failing. A complete waste of money.

Ordered the grey, received very dark grey almost black. These shelves also have screws to go through the shelf into the bracket. So much for a clean look. Shelves are made from thin press board, basically pressed cardboard. I don’t feel they would handle 25lbs sitting on the floor, let alone on a wall.Beyond disappointed in these shelves. They will be returned. I guess I’ll just make my own since most available are cheap garbage or way overpriced!

I wouldn’t even rest a glass of water on these shelves. I was initially happy with the purchase because they look fine on the wall but almost any weight put on them makes them dip at a slight angle. Obviously unsettling. I could maybe attribute this to the fact that my order came with Id 8/16 needed screws for the wall mount (so enough for the outside 4 holes) and then 8/4 screws needed to drill the two holes in the shelves itself to the wall mount.. so more than enough. Had to return these and get something far more reliable

Ok these look great but if you actually want to use them for anything don’t purchase not sturdy at all couldn’t even set a tiny 3 lb plant on it without it tilting down could be great but it’s not needs better support bars. Now I have 3 holes in my wall to fix

They look nice, easy to install, but the quality is garbage. They are made of cardboard pretty much, very flimsy. I would not pay more than $10 for them.

I like to wait until I’ve used the product for a while before writing a review. These shelves are really pretty and perfect for my space…… BUT even though some were in studs and the rest we used Sheetrock pieces and screws and after installation realized the brackets aren’t straight. The bracket is still secured to the wall but the bracket itself that slides in to the shelf is what isn’t level. I’m now removing and trying to find something different but beyond the return window.

I really like the looks of them. It says that they'll hold 25 pounds, they absolutely will not. I had a few things on them, maybe 3-4 pounds and I put them next to the wall for added support and after a short time the brackets started to bend and the shelf tilted.

Installed per instructions, but it tipped downward away from the wall way more than an acceptable amount (see picture), so I'm returning.

These shelves have a very rustic, farmhouse feel which is why I chose them. I purchased them to put over my washer and dryer with hopes of putting glass jars with my laundry pods and scent beads in the shelves however, they started to give as soon as I placed a jar on the shelf. I did not trust to let the jar on the shelf.

Super Cheap product. Brackets couldn’t support much weight at all. Use in bathroom for small products like shaving cream, lotion, etc.

When I bought these shelves and installed them, I thought they looked really nice.  After we put towels on them they started to droop.  I put shims behind the metal brackets that hold the shelves in place.  They looked great.....for a few weeks before drooping again.  I put more shims behind the metal brackets, the shelves were now pointing upwards and putting towels on them leveled out the shelves so they were actually useful....for about a week, before drooping again.  It is now too late to return them to Amazon for a refund, so they are now in a nice landfill.

These shelves are ok but they slope down slightly from the wall so if you live in a place where earth quakes happen or near train tracks I wouldn't recommend. It's an almost imperceptible downward slant from the point where they meet the wall to the front edge of the shelf. I hope this makes sense. I'm not saying they aren't level as in how they sit long ways. That would be my fault for not having them hung level what I mean is they slant downward from the wall they are hanging on. Hopefully that makes sense.

after installed one of the shelf, i decided not to put the other one on the wall because it can not hold a plate of fruits.  It kept bending down when I put things on it.  It can only hold light thing.

Even with way less than the weight limit amount. They bend and look terrible, the return window has closed or else I would return them. Just took me to long to hang - im disappointed. I even bought better screws and still not tight.

These shelves look gorgeous when first installed. However, after hanging for a couple of months the ends really sag down so that the whole shelf bows. (We don't have anything heavy on it and it's not by a heat source.)

You get what you pay for. I didn't realize how cheap the shelves would look. Maybe I can use them inside a closet or in my garage, but not in my kitchen. I should have known better.

Absolute garbage, the support frame for these shelves can't even hold the weight of the shelf itself and don't bother trying to put anything on it. I wish I still had the box to send this back. I don't think there is any way to make this usable.

Definitely can’t hold 25lbs, very flimsy and not sturdy

Looked nice before install. But should have just returned them when I saw that just putting the screws in warped the board and now they are already leaning forwarded even screwed into stud.  So many regrets.

Product design not really sturdy. Should be at least four internal brackets versus the two in order to support the entire board or the two brackets should at least be 2 inches longer so the front of the shelf won't sag. We added shelf brackets to both sides so we could at least use the product, which are now no longer floating shelves, but they have been paid for and I want to use them since they are the perfect size and I didn't not have to build them myself. Regardless of the weight stipulation, I do not think 25lbs is advisable in wall studs or drywall with the drywall anchors. Finish is nice, size is true.

Bought it to set gaming consoles on. Put a PS2 and N Switch on one and a PS4 the other. Was going to add a PS3, but both shelves have bent downward slightly. Purchasing support brackets for both shelves.If you are purchasing this for the floating shelves look note they hold less than the 25 lb estimate and should look elsewhere.I like the look of them just not good for utility.Used a stud finder and marked center location on beams for installation. I imagine drywall has an even lower weight threshold. Perhaps the weight of the shelf is incuded in the 25lb max limit

After I got the shelves up I realized they are crooked. I hung them up level, the shelves themselves have a curve to them.

The shelf is slanted toward the wall as mentioned by others and is not sable, you put something on it and it flexes because the metal mount is too thin, and has too much flex. needs to be re-engineered. i saw something in the trouble shooting saying there was heavy-duty hardware option but I can not find it.

These have a weird tilt when installed. They are level left to right but not front to back. Also the color or the wood is terrible. It’s shiny and giving 1990 panel wall vibes. I plan to keep them because they serve the purpose and look fine from a distance. But definitely not what I was expecting.

Pros: Easy to hangCons: They're really cheap quality. I knew they weren't real wood but the particle board they're made from more closely resembles cardboard than any other particle board I've ever seen. They look and feel really cheap.They're also not level (front to back). There's a fairly steep pitch that you can see in the picture, and there's no way to correct it because it's just how the brackets are made. We had no trouble leveling it from side to side, but there's just a really nothing we can do to make the shelves sit flat.

These shelves were as described but looked a little cheaper than I expected. They didn’t work for me but they were of good quality and seemed sturdy and worth the price.

They look noce, but the frame that the shelves sot on are very flimsy. I could easily bend them in half. The shelves themselves are not much better. The anchora they provide are true junk. I would not put 20lbs on these by any chance.

They were easy to install. The shelf tilts slightly downwards, though. It is wobbly, and does not feel stable or sturdy. They are cheaply made and not worth the price.

Honestly, when I opened this package I was immediately ready to return it because it felt so cheap. I wish I would have. I tried installing these shelves... and yes, very easy to install, but not sturdy whatsoever. The nails were way too thin and short. The shelves were hanging at a slant because the nails weren't large enough to hold them up, let alone with items on the shelves. Buy different shelves!

Cheaply made like a heavy card board I'm going to have to paint them before I put them up

anchors aren’t meant for drywall and the shelf quality is extremely poor - thin and breakable

Material is much too keep and doesn’t hold its 1 function which is to float on the wall. It sloped because the materials aren’t sturdy. It’s worth investing in one that’s a bit more expensive.

Was not sturdy at all - loaded less than required and still weak.

Not real wood and very deep which look weird on the wall

You can see the seam on the edges, pretty color but overall you can tell it’s not real wood

i ordered 2 sets. the 16in double pack and the 24in double pack. The 16in came with better anchors and were straight. my 24in shelf is level in the back but crooked in the front then i realized the shelf was warped. Also the 24in shelf is way too deep at 9.3 inches. You would assume this is ok but if anything is near the front u can hear it separating  from the wall since the included anchors were so crappy.

The shelves look great but they slant down and slowly do over time. Installed correctly following instructions. Will be replacing this with a more expensive option. Probably has something to do with the wall mounts

These shelves do look good despite not being made of wood. The problem is the shelves screws which arent able to be screwed all the way into the shelves! I tried hard and wasnt successful ! Also despite screwing the brackets into the wall securely, the shelves are flimsy and unstable. I ended up putting only light items on them. I hence do not recommend this product.

They look ok in our bathroom but am afraid if anyone ever leans on them they won't hold up at all.

These were super easy to install and look great but they definitely do not hold the weight indicated. The brackets started to bow just from the weight of the shelves themselves. I'll need to purchase additional support brackets.

I can’t even use one of the shelves… the pilot hole is in the completely incorrect spot. So unless I want my shelf to look terrible, it’s absolutely useless. What a piece of junk. Have you ever heard of quality control?!? Because clearly this is a common issue according to the reviews. Oh well… lesson learned! Next time I will listen to the reviews.

The color of the wood looks unnatural. Can’t speak to the sturdiness or assembly aspect, but was unimpressed with the overall look.

I love the look but the shelves are not sturdy at all. Doesn’t make me feel comfortable putting anything w/ weight on it. Light weight items only

I was gonna use this in the bathroom as a floating shelf but it is to thick and wide

Overall they look nice, but missing half the hardware to install. Very disappointed that they did not provide enough dry wall anchors and screws to hold the shelves up and had to go out and purchase my own.

My shelf doesn't fit in the bracket properly so it leans forward and has a huge gap from the wall.  I'm going add an external bracket to make it more sturdy but that defeats the purpose of a floating shelf.

These are made super cheap! I had to go buy brackets at lowes bc it wouldn’t hold 15 pounds! Don’t waste your money on these if you need it too hold heavier items. Says it holds 30 pounds that’s a joke!!

The shelves came in great condition, and looked great. However, the hardware, such as brackets to hang the shelf, were not included in the box.

the shelves are hollow and not terribly sturdy - it seems like it would be since the brackets are solid but once the shelves are installed, they are still flimsy and tilt down from the wall.

😞 Product true to description, except damaged. Box was in tact. Shelves both were damaged.

You get what you paid for… looks good but not strong at all

These shelves are engineered wood, NOT "wood".  They are not pretty shelves at all, these are going back.  Very disappointed in this purchase

There were pieces missing to install the shelf w the instructions given!! 😩I had to find and substitute my own…

The color and size of these shelves were exactly what I was looking for. For less than $20 I didn’t have high expectations for the quality. These are super lightweight but on the wall you can’t tell. Overall I would say this is a good value for money spent.The installation seemed easy enough- anchors, screws, and even a tiny level included. The anchors are very small and cheap. We ended up using different anchors we had on hand for a few of the spots because the ones that came with this shelf just didn’t work. One side of the shelf we placed on the stud, and in hindsight I wish that would have been the middle of the shelf rather than the end that we chose.These are not adjustable once screwed in, so take some time to measure and map out where you want them to be.Overall for less than $20 I am satisfied with the quality of these shelves. They are the right color and size I was looking for, and now that they are hanging I can forget about the install.

I feel like these were cheaper looking than I had hoped for but obviously they are this price for a reason. Wouldn’t be bad for a rental home but returned them for my own.

The shelves tilted under the weight of only 12 inches of Childrens books. So disappointing. Now all I have is a wall of paneling pockmarked by yellow mollies!

I ordered 4 of these - one out of four had some defect where the screw holes in the metal bars don’t line up with the holes under the shelf so it can’t screw into place securely. Otherwise they’re pretty good for the price.

Color is different than the picture (I ordered the gray). They also just look and feel cheap- do not resemble real wood in any way - they have much more of a plastic/synthetic appearance. They were fairly easy to install, although others I have used were better because they provided a paper blueprint you could use to drill your holes without having to measure anything.

I love the look of the floating shelves. However, I would not put anything super heavy on them as they don't have the most stability. Even though we chose to put in every single screw with an anchor in the drywall, it still wobbles just a bit. Also, the shelf just slides onto the bar that is attached to the wall, which makes assembly easier, but makes it more likely that the shelf will just slide off at any time. So I use it for lighter items like little plants and photos, but I wouldn't put anything too big on it.

Not sure how to start this as I do not want to leave a bad review but I want to leave an honest one.The shelves are hallow and made of plastic that looks like wood. They are a nice quality and look really nice hanging on my wall. Honestly you’d never look at them and think they are plastic. But they are hallow plastic. You could never use these in for example a kitchen area where you’d stack 8 dinner plates plus other glass dishes on them. They are not sturdy enough to handle that.They work well for what I ordered them for.  They are easy to hang and came very quickly.

My only complaint would be they are not real wood. Description says wood, they are manufactured wood.

Cute and easy to install but they say rated for 25lbs yet the shelves by themselves can barely stay up. I used drywall anchors rated for 150lbs that I used to mount my TV(they are amazing) but the metal rods inside the shelves are super flimsy, hollow, and can’t hold even 5lbs without sagging. I am getting some support mount brackets to make them work but be advised these cannot hold weight.

Instructions were missing and can’t find replacement instructions…

I ordered another set of these shelves in black since I like the original brown set I purchased previously. However, I installed these black ones and one would not sit flush against the wall no matter what I did so I ordered a replacement. When the replacement came it was a different set of shelves with different installation so I had to re-drill and add in new anchors in my wall. You can't tell after the shelves are up, but it was frustrating to be sent another product and now have a bunch of unnecessary anchors in the walls. The replacement shelves were a lot more sturdy than the originals.

So these shelves look pretty but one of our brackets were bent. Also, the provided screws and anchors are horrible and not in any way strong enough for these shelves. After one day they both started sagging - the bottom one was worse (shown in the video). We ended up going to Lowe’s and grabbing these screws and anchors, redid them all and now it’s solid. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT use the provided screws and anchors. Get your own that are rated for heavier loads.

They look very and fairly easy to install as long as you have the right tools and another person to help. THESE ARE NOT HEAVY DUTY. These are strictly for decoration. They cannot hold much weight.

Not as sturdy as I would like.  Not for use with anything with weight on it.  But looks good.

Woodgrain looks a little cheap and definitely cheaply made out of pressboard. Gets the job done and installation was easy. I purchased my own sheet rock screws to grab in the sheet rock as the one sent are not good Quality. Did have two under mount screws not align out of the two shelves to grab into the mounting bars, never could get them in.

Cute but not at steady as I would have liked, you can also see the nails down the bottom they didn’t send anything to cover them up but over all pretty good product

These shelves look nice, and the wooden shelves are sturdy, but the metal bracket is not. The support rods are welded in a single place to the metal bracket, which makes them bend and sag when any weight is placed on the shelves. I put ~15lbs on the shelves and they sag a noticeable amount (one of my guests noticed almost immediately). I am worried that they will collapse, so I will have to get additional L-brackets, which is both an added cost and defeats the purpose of hanging shelves.  Admittedly there are not many better options on Amazon for these, but just know that these will almost certainly sag, or that you will have to get additional supports.

They are really nice however; both brackets are level, of course but, when sliding the shelf into place on the bottom bracket,  it is not level, must be warped, I had to use shims to make it appear level!! I considered returning the set but, I’d be left with 16 holes in my newly painted walls!!!!!!

I wish they would have been thicker material my son accidentally bump into them and they crack we still used them and the crack is face down. But for the price I can’t complain

I bought these to go on the sides of my TV. The shelves are great for the price for two. The issue I have is that they tend to lean. They were installed with anchors it came with. I ended up buying heavy duty anchors up to 75lbs and it's still leans a little bit. It seems it's the shelves itself. I wouldn't buy again.

The shelves look nice, however we didn’t have enough hardware.

Still kept them as I had it partially installed before I noticed quality issues like bent frame on second shelf.  Don’t put much on these as the may fall off the wall.

The shelves are okay. You will want to get stronger anchors when you mount them. The ones they come with are junk.I would not put anything heavy or breakable on them (too flimsy).

Added this for shelving above toilet due to the narrow water closet type of bathrooms having little to no space for extra toilet paper holders. The material isn't as sturdy as I was expecting but it does the job to store excess toilet paper and other necessary toiletrie that you would use/want around a toilet area

First off, I would never expect 2 shelves of this size (I ordered 36.5") for $70 to be real wood, I knew they were faux. I didn't realize how flimsy they are made though!I ordered these, and went to the hardware store to get better anchors for them like a lot of the reviews advised to do. I got 75# anchors, we used 4 on each shelf. No matter how heavy of anchors you get, the shelf is still only rated for 22lbs. How do I know this? It busted not even 5 minutes after I got it hung up and started putting things on it! I'm using as a display for items I sell in live videos, and can't use for the products I wanted. The metal bracket didn't bend or break, but something inside the shelf did and now it is at an angle, enough that I'm scared to put things on it that would break if they fell.A 36.5" shelf should have a higher capacity than 22lbs..

They work and they are definitely floating shelves but you can put much on them. We put a few book up and the shelf tilted have us to re drill and leaving holes in the wall

Disappointed… very cheap looking

Fills Small area

When shelf is in wall it leans up towards the wall so things don’t fall off. Not liking this. But kept the shelfs

The shelves are wide and sturdy. However I didn't like the wood grain finish, it looked very fake and wasn't subtle at all. So I returned them.

Shelves are made of cheap material and looks very synthetic

Is kind of flimsy and the bracket is easily bent. It works for something lite.

The shelves are not wood, the hardware that comes with it is cheap and therefore, we couldn’t get the shelves completely level. My husband is very handy and particular about making sure things are done right. He was very unhappy about how the shelves look, although others may not notice. I wouldn’t buy these again.

Nice shelves, easy mounting instructions. I would have given this a higher rating except screws included were not anchor screws but black drywall screws that don’t fit into the wall anchors well. I ended up using my own wall anchors. Otherwise, my daughter likes them (I put them up in her bathroom) and has them full of her stuff.

I love these shelves and they’re exceptional for the price. However; one of them arrived with the wall anchor stuck in the shelf and it can’t come out. Because of this, you’re not able to affix it to a wall and is unusable. We only discovered after we hung the first one up and didn’t want to take the shelf off the wall to go forward with a return. Because we could only use one of the two shelves, I gave it 3 stars.

I didn't want to make many holes for screwing at my wall. That makes installation difficult.

The color was way off from the photo. It didn't look like real wood.This wasn't for me. But the quality seemed very good. It was the off color for me.

Got these to put some books on. The installation was easy enough if you have a hammer drill (I mounted mine to a concrete wall). These things look great (they are hollow, not solid wood). I put some pressure on the arms from the bracket that goes in to the shelf, these things will definitely not hold 25lbs. Put a couple of reference books on the shelf and it started to bend downwards. I would say these are for decorative purposes only with some small plants and decorations. Not for use as a bookshelf.

These look nice, however, it appeared like maybe they were solid MDF with a wood veneer and in reality they appear to be made with VERY thin MDF and are hollow. I am returning as I can't see this coming anywhere close to holding 25 pounds of weight, as claimed, without sagging.

For the price the shelves are good. I think if I had known there was exposed screws underneath I would have opted to spend a little more. Off to the hardware store for acre covers. One small chip but decided you couldn’t see it.

These are a bit darker than I anticipated,  but no big deal for me. They are also hollow, like backing board assembled into a box. The only problem I really have with these is that the back of the shelf that goes against the wall has about an inch of open space. So when it's put on the rods an inch of the shelf isn't being supported.  I believe they wanted to do an inlay but it's just too much space. Overall they are nice, but too expensive for what they are. I am not returning them.

A little over priced

We installed these shelves in our bathroom and while they are easy to install and I love the idea of the hidden, metal brackets, they are flimsy. I haven’t left anything on them because I’m concerned they won’t hold up. I started to put several folded hand towels on one and could see it flex downward, toward the front of the shelf. I tried it on the second one and same thing. So now nothing sits on them except three small bottles of hair product, and only next to the wall.

Three shelves, measured the exact same way each time, turned out three different lengths from the wall. One also leans back so it makes a perfectly level shelf look off. I guess they're worth the price considering what these types of shelves go for, but expect some frustration.

Product arrived scuffed and damaged.

Made of stamped MDF. The metal bracket is not the entire length of the shelf. The last 1 foot on each side has no support. I would not put shelfs like this in a rental property, my client chose them. There decently made. Not bad looking thought.

This item is great in concept, but is average quality at best. I made sure the brackets were leveled during install, but when I attached the shelf to the bracket, 1 shelf didn't level (1 of 2 shelves).

Product is Cheap in price and cheap in quality but oddly looks great at the same time. It does wobble with the screws and anchors provided. Luckily I had better ones on hand that I could swap out for. If you don’t; my suggestion would be have some or maybe choose a different product.

Very cheap

I was hoping for the best with these. The brackets were stuck to the shelf. One of the shelves I couldn’t even install because the brackets wouldn’t come out. I tried everryyyything to pull it out and I ended up damaging it. Super bummer. One is on the wall and it’s ok but I’m still a little nervous about it

I recently installed this set of black floating bathroom shelves, and I'm very pleased with the overall experience and outcome.Firstly, the installation process was impressively easy. The shelves came with all the necessary hardware and clear instructions, making it straightforward to mount them securely on the wall. Even with minimal DIY skills, I had them installed in no time.The quality of the shelves is decent. They feel sturdy and well-made, capable of holding various bathroom essentials without any issue. While they aren't the most premium shelves on the market, they certainly provide good value for the price.Aesthetically, these shelves look fantastic. The sleek black finish adds a modern, elegant touch to my bathroom. They blend seamlessly with the rest of my decor and provide a stylish way to organize and display items.In summary, these black floating bathroom shelves are a great addition to any bathroom. They offer decent quality, easy installation, and a beautiful look. I highly recommend them for anyone looking to add functional and stylish storage to their bathroom space.

I like the fact that it’s deep with 9” in depth. As you can see from the picture you can place items in front of others. Simple and sophisticated, the boards don’t have the substance real wood shelves do but they look great and are pretty sturdy. Note that if yours are wiggly or not touching wall it’s because the bracket is either wobbly (not tight enough) or it’s not drilled into studs, very important.

Even though I mounted against studs it feels pretty wobbly still. It’s ok enough for me since I don’t have kids that would try to touch them but they definitely aren’t the most solid build. At least they look nice and hold the weight of the books I have on them.

These are very cute and fit my space very well!! Easy to install as well! The only issue I ran into was the small bottom screws on the shelf itself not fitting into the bracket. Some fit in and anchored into the bracket well, some did not line up properly. Whether that was user error or the quality of the shelves, I do not know. Even without all the screws in, it is very sturdy and holds a lot! Highly recommend, especially for the money!

Love these and actually want to get another set. However they do sit at a slope on the wall. My partner installed them so I’m not sure if that was user error or not!

Much more difficult for the shelves to align with one another.

I love them, but they’re just a little bit smaller than I expected

Nice easy to hang not to big

Making some small changes to the guest bathroom, we needed some smaller shelving to replace a bulkier unit.  These do the job perfectly.  Yes, you can tell it's engineered wood, but it still looks good, is easy to install, and is functional.

Easy to install. Nice looking and sturdy, but the visible screws on the bottom are tacky. Why no caps?

We needed additional storage above a toilet in our main bathroom and these filled the bill beautifully. The color was respresented very true. Absolutely recommend.

I initially bought these shelves for my bathroom. They ended up being too big so I put them somewhere else. The fake wood doesn't look as real as I would have liked it. But from a distance with stuff on it, they look nice.

Hollow board-look shelf. Good for a small cookbook/ set of wine glasses.Easy to assemble/mount. Your friends will think it’s real wood!

Perfect for the office and easy to install. The quality isn’t the greatest, however, once up it’s not noticeable that they are not real wood. Lightweight.

Great for the price. They are very lightweight (feel hollow). They do have a little more sheen than I was expecting. Easy to hang. Appreciated that they included a level device.

I have 4 of these & would be better if they had elongated mounting holes so to align with wall studs

Liked the simple  set up, got it on sale. Fairly  easy to install  but had to check for studs in the bathroom wall and make sure I didn't  drill into a water pipe. It did take me waaay longer than necessary since i was doing it alone. Needed extra space for all my bathroom  crap. I think it looks cute, bought a second set.

I bought these for my bathroom and did install them myself. I am by no means handy but will say it was hard to get some of the outside screws in because the frame interfered with the screwdriver. I could not turn the screwdriver all the way straight, so attempted to use a drill. Needless to say, the screws are a little crooked and are not flat to the wall, but thankfully you need to use like 6 more screws so I had faith it would hold up. I don't have anything heavy sitting on them, and they do look really nice.

Very easy to install.  Doesn't look cheap and definitely serves the purpose!

Nice floating shelves and pretty easy for a DIY'r to install...The bracket makes it fairly easy.Time will tell about the quality..Used in a bathroom for heavily used summer rentals

Cute sturdy shelves for the kitchen

I bought these for my daughters room and they were very easy to assemble and very sturdy. The shelves are thick and hold a good amount of weight in them. I would purchase these shelves again

Great shelves, but gave 4 stars because they didn’t come with proper sheet rock anchors so had to purchase from a local hardware store. Without them the shelves would not be able to hold much weight at all.

Described by seller accurately. Easy to install and looks great

Good, solid shelf. Comes with level which was nice. Easy to install and sturdy enough.

Overly loose fit between the holes in the shelves and the support rods.  After tightening the top screws, there was a small gap at the top of the shelf and the wall which created a slight forward lean to the shelves.

The brackets were bent upward so it didn't work. I got the larger shelves and they worked great so I got the smaller one and the brackets were bent upward so the were unusable

Nice shelves, with one thing I would like to see added. When the shelves are installed high enough, the bright plated screws on the bottom are very visible and contrast highly with the dark woodgrain. Dark screws would be very helpful.

These shelves look fantastic the width is great and provided so much storage to my pantry. Great deal for the price! Nice quality as well.

They were a little smaller than I was hoping but they work great. Easy to hang up and very sturdy. Overall I really like how thick and versatile they are. I’ve already purchased another set.

The shelves are a nice quality. Easy to hang. Was not the color or texture I was hoping for.

These shelves will get the job done, however you don’t have to look too closely to see that the wood grain is just a print.

Sent back but good product

They seem like great shelves. I did, however, need to drill another hole into the brackets in order for it to line up with only 2 studs. Otherwise I could only hit 1 of them and that made me nervous. The rest of the holes I did use heady duty drywall anchors rated at 105lbs. It seems sturdy right now, but it's still early. I also used all my own screws for mounting the brackets. The ones it comes with seem small and unreliable. I wasn't taking any chances.They look great for the price since I don't have time to make my own shelves.

Not true to picture

Holy cow! I'm intimidated by just the directions on how to hang these!

Not a bad product but on the pricier side

Directions are easy to follow. Good quality shelves, looks exactly like picture

Took a couple tries  to put up and get level. Not very sturdy.  Made with cheap materials.  Does the job though.

I love the look and now that we have added a little glue to the back, they are level.  The leveling was the only problem we encountered and we solved the problem. We still have to level the top shelf it is now sagging. So when we correct it. I will be very happy. Thank you!

Good quality, lightweight and easily installed

All of these floating shelves seem a bit price gougey to me, so I'd suggest keeping an eye out for lightning deals/coupons before buying.This particular product is pretty decent, coming with all the hardware needed.A puzzling missing piece of information, assuming you want to use the included wall anchors/screws, is there is no direction for size of pilot hole needed. I read through other reviews (and the Q&A), and while someone else noted that this was annoying (and that they had to guess), they neglected to share their guess. I used a 3/16" bit and the anchor seemed to seat properly into the hole (after a few whacks with a hammer to set).Plenty of holes in the mounting bracket, which is nice (want to use more anchor points due to weight being put on shelf, etc).Good product, just no way each shelf should run you $12 or $13 each .... but, again, it seems that most of these shelves are marked up in this manner.

Really like this product and the look it added to a small bathroom.  It is not solid wood, but has a great appearance.

Nice product.

Good quality, looks nice!

Installing the shelves were pretty easy, however they aren’t very heavy, so I wouldn’t put anything heavy on the shelves.  I have rock as decor in one of the canisters and I'm still pretty leery about having them hold up on the shelf.  But other than that, im satisfied with the look and purchase.

Looks great. A little shaky, though, like anything heavy will bring it down.

Love how they look but I wish the bracket was long enough to reach 2 studs for my peace of mind. Hung these to display my grandmother's owl collection, a couple of which are quite heavy. I do appreciate that they included anchors at least and hopefully, they'll stay up a long time.

The QEEIG 36-inch Rustic Brown Floating Shelves are a fantastic addition to any kid's room, combining both practicality and style. These shelves offer a generous 36 x 9-inch surface, perfect for organizing toys, books, or displaying cherished keepsakes without taking up valuable floor space. The rustic brown finish adds a cozy, natural element that can easily blend with various themes, from playful to more mature décor as your child grows.One of the standout features of these shelves is their sturdiness. Built to last, they can support a considerable amount of weight, ensuring that even heavier items like books or small storage bins are securely held. The floating design is particularly useful in a kid's room, as it keeps items out of reach of younger children, reducing clutter and potential messes on the floor.Installation is relatively easy, with clear instructions and all necessary hardware provided. The shelves sit flush against the wall, giving a clean, modern look that enhances the room's overall aesthetic. They also provide a perfect platform for creating a rotating display of your child's artwork or favorite items, encouraging creativity and personal expression.Overall, these shelves are a smart investment for parents looking to optimize space in a kid's room while maintaining a stylish, organized environment. The blend of durability, design, and functionality makes them a versatile choice that can adapt to your child's needs over time.I couldn’t be happier with the purchase and highly recommend these shelves whether you are using them like me in your kid’s room, in the kitchen, living room, bathroom or any room in your home!

Looks good. Sturdy and easy to install. Great price.

This was the perfect touch to finish my bathroom decor. Great quality and very easy to install. The fit was perfect

Ordered this item for a bar area in my home. The item arrived quickly and i put it up. Had no issues with reading the instructions, and the finished product looks fabulous! I would definitely recommend this product.

Simple installation. Look great in my game room. Probably can't hold a ton of weight though.

These floating shelves offer a small touch of style to a small space. They were both easy to level, anchor to the wall, and feel sturdy once installed. If you are needing some small, quality storage solutions for a small space, these will do the trick!!

For the price and easy install, I give it 5 stars. We have a small master bathroom with limited space available for storage, so these shelves made the perfect upgrade for extra toilet paper, and wash cloths! Obviously, they have a weight limit, but so far I am in love with what we are using them for. I appreciate that all the screws and anchors were provided (with extras!) and the pack came with a level, which made the install that much easier.

Happy with the quality, ease of installation and color.The use of a level is a must. I did use a better quality drywall anchor than what came with the order. And when the anchor was inserted into the wall I made sure to apply pressure so that the anchor was flush against the wall. So there wouldn't be any gap when the shelf was screwed in.

These shelves look great and hold everything. I recommend using a better anchor and doing a thin predrill before installing to double check for studs or things behind the wall. Also make sure the bars are level. Installation instructions weren’t super clear so those are my tips! I love the shelves though and they look great! 👍

I love this product!  These shelves were easy to hang and came with plenty of extras.  They were perfect for my office space.  Look of wood without the weight.  A++

Very easy to install, only one person necessary. All tools included, extras parts as well.Sturdy but don’t give off a natural wood vibe, quality reflected by price.

Easy to install, light weight. Originally I had ordered smaller size, but they were too small for the area. So I order the longer size, which are wider, but didn’t realize it till I got them, which makes them stick out further,  I wish they offered longer in narrow size.  But still made it work

These floating shelves are easy to install and work exceptionally well for holding the small Bose speakers (3lbs) I use them for.

Good quality, easy to install, and pretty sturdy! I was scared to put anything as heavy as a large candle on it since it was above my bed, but it held multiple medium sized books and other knickknacks pretty well. Got the brown color and photos in listing are very accurate to what I received.

Easy to install and beautiful to look at. Currently displaying my amazing crystal collection

I’ve bought plenty of shelves. These are easy to hang up and look absolutely stunning!

Hubby said they were not hard to install. Different look. Modern. Bought x 3. Well packaged. This shelf style I really like.

They came out amazing and super easy to install would definitely recommend 👍🏻

Good quality

These worked well above the toilet.  Easy to install and fill a tall narrow space.

I liked color, length, thickness and overall great look on wall.

These upgraded my bathroom. Small but really nice.

This shelf set is very cute. Easy to install, I only used 2 of the yellow anchors for each shelf because I won’t be putting anything heavy on them. Each shelf has 7 screws for the wall, and 2 small ones for the undersides. The metal dowel part did have a very slight slant upwards which in turn seems to make the shelves sit upwards. Perhaps they were made that way to withstand heavy objects. Either way, for the price, I’m very happy I didn’t have to build yet another floating shelf set. These came premade. Not real wood but they look good. I love them

I bought to of these shleves to make one long in my livingroom!!! Very easy to put up!!! Great quality!!

Look fantastic!  Well built and light weight.

These turned out so cute. They are slightly smaller than I had envisioned even after trying to measure it out to get an idea, but they fit the space well. Overall they were easy to install and so far haven’t moved.

Would recommend

This is exactly what I had in mind for our little bathroom. The instructions were easy to follow, went up with no problem, and are quite sturdy. Thumbs up!

I needed some shelves for my crochets. Gone through this one and decided to try this product. The setup is easy and the shelves look nice afterall. I didn't try how much weight they could handle but my stuffs are about 3lbs.

Bought these to go around my fireplace cute simple, fairly straightforward to install

These shelves are a game-changer! You will appreciate the organization that these quality shelves provide. Very handsome, clean look and has the appearance of being weightless. I'm definitely purchasing more!--Gail

Grab a level and a drill and you’re good to go! They work great in our powder bathroom above the toilet. Installation was super easy, coming from a very impatient 29 year old wife LOL

The one thing not in directions was drill bit size for mounting holes .

I bought a couple sets of these They work great got to be in my bedroom They hold decent weight definitely and look good

I really love these shelves. Easy to install and sturdy. We bought other sizes. For all our rooms and bathrooms.

I absolutely adore these floating shelves! They are exactly as described and a breeze to install. I bought them to create additional display areas in my boutique, and they have proven to be both stylish and sturdy. I would highly recommend them to others looking for versatile shelving options.The only minor downside I encountered was the lack of screw cover stickers or caps. Typically, shelves are mounted at a height where the underside is visible, revealing the screw placements. To address this, I used some spare sticker covers I had on hand to conceal the screws, which did the trick.Overall, despite this small inconvenience, the floating shelves have been a fantastic addition to my boutique, adding both functionality and aesthetic appeal to the space.

Made very nicely

These were perfect for over our guest toilet. Look nice and have held up well!

very easy to put up, nice quality, looks great

I was wanting some little shelves in our half bathroom so I ordered these and they were perfect! I traveled to our local little thrift store and picked out some cute things to put on them! Love!!!

Love the shelve color. Hung them on my bathroom wall. Match perfectly

I used one in my laundry room and one in my kitchen. They are easy to hang, but I wouldn't put to much weight on them. I'm using for decor.

They are even better in person and way better after installing. I would encourage you to buy them as I will be getting another set myself.

Look good for the money. Pretty stout also.

Oh my word, I love these shelves and the difference it made to the look of the room. The wall had been so blank for so long and needed something else and the shelves were definitely the trick. I bought two sets hung them staggered. My husband is very handy And it seemed like they were very easy for him to hang. Did require a level and a pencil, but I’m definitely going to order some more for another room in the house. Great quality and great price.

Easy to install, sturdy, well made

Got these for my bathroom and I love them! Great product!

Upon receiving this replacement filter, I placed the original side by side with the replacement.  Sorry to say the replacement is not tall enough to fit properly.  Short about the thickness of two penny, enough to hear it rattle when placed into position and shaken up and down.  It leaves a gap in the air seal at the top which allows air to bypass the filter seal, making the replacement filter completely useless.I cannot vouch if it's HEPA quality as claimed, or even carbon, maybe just black coloring, but if they lie about being a perfect fit replacement (and it isn't), then what else are they lying about.

I returned this item.  It did not work in the LEVOIT Core air purifier.

These are not the high Quality filters, they are the knock off brand.I dislike spending money for the better quality filters to only receive the lesser quality filters.

It doesn't work!

These filters are about 1/8 to a 1/4 too short. They don't make a firm seal at the top. I think it is going to affect (or is that effect) the performance of the air cleaner. May be able to add something to the top to make them work.

Good inexpensive replacement filters for the Levoit. Slight smell probably from packaging but goes away quickly. Not sure if they last as long but hopefully they will.

Cheap Replacement

Replacement filters for air purifiers.

Needed replacement filters and found these and they fit perfectly!

This filter fits perfectly and does a good job at filtering. At least as good as the factory original filter.

Way cheaper than OE it just needs to last at least half as long and I'll be happy

Easy to clean, filters out dust particles, just like the name brand

High quality, works perfect in our air purifier. Gives me 6 months of use and air smells so clean. Easy to put in the air purifier. Great value for the price. Love having fresh air.  It makes no extra noise.

I used this to replace my filter in my air purifier and it works perfectly. The noise is so low you can barely hear it with my purifier. It filters out my living space very well and it gets rid of the cooking odor fast when I use it with my over-top exhaust. It’s a perfect replacement when you need it.

This was a good deal they fit perfectly in my air filters for the bedrooms. They last a while and do their job. I can always tell when they are getting ready to be changed bc my kids start getting stuffy. So they definitely work

Fits perfectly in my air purifier. Very easily to clean

works as needed

High quality, perfect fit. Great for pet dander.

This filter helps pull the allergens out of the air. In all seasons. Of course in the winter it seems to pull more than the summer. I leave it running constantly.  No noise.

I love my air purifier was easy to replace very reasonably in price! Two for the money definitely worth it!

I do love my air purifiers. It was crazy when it was time to change the filter to see how dirty they are. It was like wow these things really do work and the filters I bought for replacement were perfect. They’re not overpriced and they are doing their job is to be a new replacement.

Fits the Levoit Core Mini Air Purifier perfectly.Filter filters as intended.I have made multiple purchases for replacement as I own 4 minis and will order again soon.

this fits perfectly into my levoit air purifier. top quality filter.

With a new filter, the air in my bedroom takes care of dust and dog dander.  I used to wake up with a headache but not with the filter.  I always have my long haired dog sleep with me;  now there is no problem.

Great buy

I purchased these for my Levoit air purifier. They look exactly like the name brand ones but for a way better price.

Second time purchasing these filters, they work great.

Home Depot sells this air purifier in my area but doesn’t sell the replacement filters.Amazon to the rescue! Also, you get two for a great price. Shipped next day, bonus.

My go-to for filters…

Filter is working great

The filters are functioning as they were intended and great price!

Works in my Levoit air purifier.

I'm unfortunately a smoker. My 30 year old ranch style home is basically surrounded by bean or corn fields. The carpet needs to be replaced eventually. However!!!  The Levoit air purifier is GREAT and these filters are AMAZING! I HIGHLY recommend! The dust is lower and no smell of cigarettes at all!!!!

well, first i need it and it works.

I love this air filter and replacement for my small guest bedroom. It works so well for small spaces.

Fit great

Liked the delivery and the brand of filter for my mini core purifier.

We cleaned the originals 6 months ago, however, the new filters are way cleaner than you’ll ever be able to get by cleaning your existing filters.  Change them annually or whatever you’re comfortable with.

Thank

The amount of dust and dander this picked up is disgusting. Can definitely tell a difference in our air quality.

It’s quiet & helps a lot.

Easy replacement no issues, seems quality

Worked well and easy to change.

Exactly what I needed.

We ordered these to replace ones in my wife's office air purifier and they fit perfectly. They seem to perform the same quality of purification as we head into the wildfire smoke months out west, our home inside is still clean air. When the time comes I'll definitely order these again.

I order filters pretty regularly for my air purifier. With 3 dogs and a cat, these are a must in my home. They are compatible with the Levoit Core Mini.

Great replacement filter and comes with 6 scent pads that you can add your essential oils to that I didn't even realize came with it! Shipped fast and arrived in good condition,  packed well and easy to use.

We bought this during a smoke advisory from forest fire, and it did make us breath easier while at home.  It's so quiet we have to check it to be sure it's still running. The warning light for when the filter needs to be replaced is a nice feature.  Probably won't be using the fragrance discs, but might give them a try.

Works the same as the expensive name brand, at a lower price.

It fits great & have no issues with it.

I use this for my Levoit mini, they work great.

Works great 👍

Excellent air purifier for small area.

The two pack saved money. Looks just like the original filter.

I like knowing that our air is clean.

Was very easy to install. Perfect fit and like that I got 2, so it made it a better value.

Great fit.  Will buy again.

Kept smelling a burning scent coming from the purifier. I sensed it was coming from the off brand filter. Sure enough it was.

Bought the air filter. Works fine. Never was sent the replacement filters, even though I bought them.

These fit in the unit, but as soon as I started the air filter an awful smell started spreading in the room. Within five minutes I had to put the old filter back in.  I could not stand the smell emanating from these filters. If you want fresh air, buy a different replacement filter.

Seems to be working but misleading as not the brand name I thought I was receiving

Clearly cheaper filters that do not trap as much dust as the OEM products.

Was not an exact fitting match to an actual H13 filter.

These filters are lower quality for sure. You get what you pay for. But if you're looking for something cheap and don't have a serious need for fine filtration, these are for you. The original filter I have for my air purifier, you can't really see through them as much as these. You can see that the density of the black foam is much less density in these than the original Levoit filters. It's also little hard to notice, but the white folds also aren't as dense either, less folds than my original. The white outside sheet seems to also be of lower density than the original. So literally these filters are less dense in every way that counts.  I don't have allergies or a need for maximum filtration so I decided to keep them. They're definitely way cheaper than the original. I bought an air purifier to help with odors and air circulation after I do home improvement projects for when the dust and spray paint odors/particles fly around. I wouldn't know if I trust these for fine particles, mold/mildew, anything much more fine than what you can see superficially floating in the air. I'll give them 3 stars for pricing and still being able to filter out SOMETHING.

This filters are good, the machine is super silent, but for 2 filters  $20 is too high, specially they are not washable and you have to keep buying every 6 months. I tried washing my old ones they somewhat washed, but it's not clean by any means. So, yes, good product, expensive and wasteful. Lot's of waste added to land fields for no reason.

I like the PERSONAL  size for my night table, also the small round filters that can be placed in a Slot - Do what that does is when A few drops of Essential Oil are placed on the pads before inserting into the slot- the results are a nice aroma in my room- Works as stated for about 6 months -However my husband smokes heavily!!!! So the special  filter becomes dark gray ( of course) quickly and the replacement Filters are rather expensive - I cannot get in stores- Only online - Home Depot carries the larger model and sells the filter- but not the one for the  Personal Size-  It works fine for general room size for someone like me without Allergies -

I have only had these for a short while, but I looked at it and it appears to be working.  Hopefully they last.

Appears the same in looks, make and use as OEM filter.

was what I exp

These are filters. They fit the machine.I would give 5 starts but said 4 stars because it's hard to know if they were made properly or poorly due to country of origin being known for poor copy products. Price was right though:)

These replacements filters are very good and fits perfectly .

My bedroom air purifier needed a filter change.  I shopped around and I could not find replacement filters anywhere.  So, I ordered them on Amazon and I had them really fast, and at a reasonable price.  The filters do a great job cleaning the air in my bedroom.

This purifier is perfect size for one room, minimal noise & sleek appearance! The filters work great & produce fresh clean air

These fit my air purifier great. I use this in my office. I used to sneeze a lot in my office and notice that has significantly decreased. These filters seem to catch a lot of small dust particles I didn’t see with my eyes. Easy to swap.

This air purifier makes a noticeable difference in air cleanliness. It runs quietly, does not take up much space and the amount of dust/allergens it collects when I vacuum off the filters (weekly) or replace the filters (monthly) is astounding. I don't use or put oils in the tiny sponge dot  compartment as I don't like "fragrance air" because most such oils smell fake or cheap or perfume-ish. My priority is clean air and these purifiers are REALLY good. You'll see they collect a LOT of particle dust even though you cannot "see" it in the air. The result is you do FEEL cleaner air through your lungs and sinuses and you DO feel better. You might tell yourself your AC air ducts are mega-filtered and your home is generally clean and dusted but DO NOT ASSUME anything until you buy one of these air purifiers and see for yourself the amount of stuff they pull out of the air!!!  You don't have to be a sickie to NEED one -- everyone NEEDS cleaner air no matter where they live or their state of health. You'll be glad.

Work perfect.

Fits my levoit air purifiers perfectly. Looks exactly the same as the originals, but much cheaper. Highly recommend

They filter the air

I have a Lenoit mini core air filter. My filters always get here on time. Good quality.  They do just fine.

Smoke removal

Love this product! LEVOIT is wonderful! It takes smoke out of the air and replaces clean air including pet hair & pet smell from cat litter. Love it!!❤️ Wanting more through our the house!

The air cleaner/Filter system is so easy to use. Replacing the filter and scent pads is the same! I’m glad they didn't Skimp on the scent pads especially that you can only Use 1 pad per scent!

Easy and simple to insert

I like that these filters last a long time before needing to buy new. You can vacuum them !

I replaced my dirty one with the new. I found new diffuser sponges in with the new filters, I was even happier.

Same filters for a better deal.

Nothing could be easier or more effective.  My levoit purifier quietly keeps the air fresh and clean.  I just replaced the filter.  They come as 2 in a box and arrived shortly after I ordered them.  They are each wrapped neatly in plastic. The filter was as easy to replace as a coffee pod in a coffee machine.  The 3 stage HEPA filter was truly the best choice for me.

We have a cat and these make the experience so much better I would buy again

Ordered these replacement filters fit perfectly highly satisfied

As described

Included a pack of odor eliminators that gold oils and so forth.

5 stars.  Just as described.

Very good filters

This worked great!!

Same filter from Walmart cost me over $30. Got two here for 1/2 the cost

love this filter for my small office

Very nice and fit my hepa😊

Great filter and a great price!

They are always sooooo dusty when it’s time to replace them

They fit my unit and works great.

This filter is a good filter for my air cleaner!

fits and works

Works great with my air purifier

I'm just excited about having the two 🤗  I feel like I'm sleeping better.

It does a good job of cleaning the air in my small bedroom

I bought these as filter replacements for my leviot mini. They fit perfectly

Perfect fit. Gets the job done. I love the ease of installation.

These filters came quickly and are so easy to install! They caught so much dust I was beating myself up for not getting an air purifier sooner.

Filter looks to be exactly the same size as original. I’ve read others can be a little shorter. It went in easy and seems to be working fine.

Did the job

Worked as advertised.

Even though they are not the name brand filter recommend for my air filter, they fit perfectly and seem to be working just fine.

I repurchased this brand because each filter lasted 7 months.

These air filters work great and the price is great as well.

Fits the mini Levoits perfectly.  Has charcoal layer as well

Much cheaper than the original and fits well

They work just as good as the pricier filters and fit perfectly.

Most of the other off-brand versions of this filter sold on Amazon do not fit well, they're too short by 1/8" to 1/4".  This one is the perfect height.

Use these right by the cat litter box

It's not that I dislike it I just opened it today to change the filter and it is the wrong size. Now I'm stuck with it.

This product doesn't fit in my Levoit.  Very frustrating!!!

The product size does not have a exact fit to the core 300 had to put some painters tape on the bottom to create a better seal

Smells like burning plastic….cant return due to not having the manufacturers box anymore. Don’t recommend this brand

The filter does not fit.The filter height is too high for me to put the lid on! I am going to return this ill-fitting product and purchase a genuine filter!

Not sure if they are old or badly made. But returning

these fit the machine yes.but they need changed every 2-3 weeks these do no t last 6 months like the name brand ones do.My daughter has severe asthma so I check the filter every couple days and have had to change these ones twice already in 30 days.keep in mind you get what you pay for!

First problem is that the filter was damaged out of the box but looked like it would still work.  The second problem is that there was no documentation in the box. Nothing that explains how to attach the two sided prefilter. Nothing that indicates which side of the two sided prefilter faces outward. Hope i did it correctly.  Third, you must be sure the prefilter is attached very snugly to the main filter or else it will catch on the housing and makes installation difficult. We will see how well it actually filters the air.

It doesn’t fit

I ordered a couple non-factory filters for my air purifier to see if I could save some money, given how quickly I go through filters. This was one of my less successful orders.The good: This fit my machine and generally looked similar to comparable products. It looked clean and new.The not-so-good: This noticeably made no impact to the pet odors I try to control in the room. I also still had some minor allergy issues normally resolved by using a factory filter. I don’t have a way to measure this to prove it was the filter, but I trust my nose.Overall, this wasn’t an effective product for me.

First of all, I had no idea the Lv 300 air purifier had different type filters. Different colors are for specific need. Before I had the white, it came with the unit. And to be honest; I hadn’t been impressed. I have a 300 in every room in the house and the smaller in all the bathrooms. We have dogs and cats in house. I purchased this air purifier because I was suffering with headaches, stuffiness, swollen eyes, sneezing , never could get rid of the animal smells regardless how often I cleaned, nearly daily, plus layers of dust on everything in spite of dusting every day. A very knowledgeable person recommended this air purifier. This time, I purchased the green replacement filter. So right now it under investigation. That’s only 3 stars .. I’ll post an update if allowed.

Correct model number, but efficiency is different than expected!

I like that it fits well with my Levoit however the mesh filter openings seem larger than the name brand so not sure if it’s filtering the finer particulates. Time will tell!

My Levoit 300 didn’t recognize the new filter right away even though I said change the filter before putting the new filter in and restarting after locking It back in place. Not sure if it was a good choice to buy another brand

Worked just as claimed.  Fit was perfect.

The OEM filters for the Levoit Core 300 air purifier can be pretty expensive, especially if you are replacing them often about every 3-4 months like they suggest. Thankfully, there are a lot of off brand filters being offered now, at significantly better pricing such as two off-brand filters for the price of one of the brand replacement filters, nuts!This filter is similar to the Levoit Core 300 Pet filter and as of a month in has performed similarly and perfectly without any issues seen so far. There is an outer mesh filter that captures large debris like pet hair for example, then the middle layer is the HEPA filter, and the 3rd inner most layer has the carbon bits that help capture smells. Overall this filter appears to be doing the job just the same as the original filters, at a lot lower cost. Will buy again if it continues to perform without issue.

I have tried a few different 300s filters - I am not sure any of them are actually different from one another (aside from the color / marketing), with the exception of the smoke filter (which I do also have and use). These seem just like my regular white filters. The pros are that they fit the 300s and filter air, which is the bare minimum. They do filter adequately, but again it may as well be a regular filter as it doesn't seem to do anything any differently.

Bought these on a whim to replace the clogged filter no longer doing it's job.Couple weeks in and it's working great! Good value, and we've noticed an improvement in how outer bedroom feels and smells. Not any difference in noise, either.

This filter made a substantial improvement in air quality from the standard filter which came with the Core 300 unit.  Well worth the money

Perfect fit in the purifier.

These filters are perfect for my use!

Great valueSeems same quality as oem

Works well

as advertised..good price, good service

I have been using the LEVOIT air purifier for about 6 months now, but I have been using the regular filter that it comes with. I have three dogs, and I knew I needed to try the filter intended for pets because the machine just wasn't keeping the dust away as good as I had hoped (although it was working very well). After changing to this filter, I have noticed a huge difference and hope to continue seeing less dog hair and dander in my home.

Order came in good condition! Love this purifier.

I have pet’s and even if I had no pet’s I would have to have this wonderful product.  Dust is in the air and collects on everything in your ones home. This takes care of the harmful airborne spores, dust mites etc. I’m so thankful we have this as a choice in caring for our health.

Same quality as original at bargain price. Next day delivery. I always have replacements on hand

The filter seems like any other filter I've had except when I decided to get the "4 in 1" they also sent me the white "outer filter" you see in the picture and you must install it yourself which is just peel and stick on one end.  I got 2 filter and it came with 4 of those white stick on outer filters which to be honest is kinda a turn off. Seems flakey. But other than that is just like the 30$ option. Only time will tell if the additional filter wrap is worth it.

They are great they fit my machine

love the pet filters !

This are peefect for pets. We just wipe everything off regularly and they last a long time.

Will order again

10/10

As expected

Places in our two units that we have in our house. They are great and we have them running 100% of the time.

Live with a cleaner nose !

I love the air purifier by Levoit and it is encouraging to see replacement filters at such a fair price.  I'm happy to replace them timely at this price point. Five stars!

Works perfectly. Easy to install.

I had the original that came with the unit and i bought these for smoke smell.  They really work compared to the original!

I have a Clevast Air Purifier. The AP-220 replacement Clevast so longer sells. These filters fit perfectly I plan to stock up on them before they become obsolete.

I live next to a chainsmokers. She tries to smoke outside, but sometimes fails to do so. These filters do a pretty good job of filtering the smoke. You need to have enough units though to do the job.

Best air purifer and replacement filters we have used

Perfect fit and function at a very competitive price.

Love the removable pre filters that this comes with. It allows you to get twice the usage of a single filter without needing to purchase new ones so often. This is a great feature.

Using this machine really makes a difference in the room.

These filters are compatible. Worked like a charm.

Great replacement filter and a great price for the two pack

Great value when buying 2 at one time and they fit perfectly!

Great filters

Scene 1-Living Room: I'm sitting on a couch looking like the "shrug" and "weary face" emojis. I am exasperated after trying several other knock-off brand filters only to realize that they were all subparresulting in vast differences in air quality when compared to the performance of the OEM Levoit brand filters. I was super bummed to think I'd have to continue to pay thru the nose for the original Levoits for all of eternity.Scene 2 - Office Building: While surfing Amazon during work hours, I came across these Levoit Core 300 compatible filters and decided to give another off-brand one last try. Naturally, after previous attempts, I went into this with low expectations...Scene 3 - Back to the Living Room: The box of filters arrived, and like an animal of prey with a fresh kill, I ripped the box to shreds while laughing maniacally. (Too much, you say?...okay. Let's try this again...take 2...) The box had arrived, and I was looking forward to gently opening it and testing out these new filters. The first thing I noticed is they have the exact same look and are the same exact size as the Levoit brand filters. Installation is a breeze (as are all filters for the Core 300). I unscrewed the bottom of the unit and pop this new filter in. I then turned on my purifier. There was no rattling or banging or screeching or buzzing...only the sweet sound of my room being filled with purified air just like it did with the Levoit brand filters. "HELLO!...do you guys smell that!?!", I ask nobody because I'm the only person in the room. "It's the smell of clean, fresh air, free of dander and particulates!", I say to no one again. "Yes!!! I can smell that! The smell of this fresh air almost makes me happier than the smell freshly minted cash!", I reply, because talking to no one seems to be a theme here.Scene 4- Fast motion montage over a span of a week of using these new off-brand filters: I have yet to notice any comparable differences from the OEM Levoit brand filters in the behavior of my purifier or the quality of the air. In the last scene of the montage, I have just reached the very top of my staircase. I jump around like Rocky Balboa and proclaim, "Thank you, off brand filters!" after not having dropped a single Kleenex or sneezed once during the grueling townhouse climb.Scene 5 - Ending Sequence - Grand Canyon Donkey Trail Tour: I am riding a donkey into the sunset along with my trusty Levoit Core 300 and its new off brand filters. While breathing freely due to these quality filters keeping my donkey allergies at bay, I look to the skies and exclaim, "Highly recommend!" to anyone within earshot.The End.

These replacement filters are excellent for keeping my air purifier working efficiently. The 3-in-1 filtration system, including activated carbon, ensures that the air remains clean and free of allergens. They are easy to install and last a long time, making them a cost-effective choice for maintaining air quality in my home.

Fit my levoit 300s and works as well as it's original filter.I measured the air flow of an original filter and this filter and found no difference in air flow. If it had flowed more air, it likely wasn't trapping as much pollution and; and flowing less air would have meant it was too restrictive/not as efficient.  Since it flowed the same CFM as the original, it's likely filtering as well as the original.Also, the 300s has a built-in particle counter and it showed no change between the original filter and this filter.So this filter works just as well as the original for a lot less cost.

I have a cat who sheds a lot, I got these to try out if they make a difference compared to the regular white filters. They seem to do the trick and hold tons of dust and fur in.

These are a good quality, no rattle or whistles. No smells when I unpackaged these or with first use. They are picking up lots of dust. I don’t know how the dog/pet ones really compare to standard options, but because my small dog sheds a ton, I thought this would be the better option. I have severe allergies and using an air purifier with a good filter really makes a difference for me, especially with year round allergies in AZ being so bad. None of these filters are super cheap, but you prob wouldn’t want that anyways if you really struggle with allergens. Also, I don’t know that a thinner filter is easier on this type of unit like it is with a standard ac unit, but that might be worth researching to ensure lifespan of your purifier. Overall, I’d purchase these again.

Ordered these because the branded filters are quite expensive. they are the exact same size as the others, and are supposed to be the pet-filtering type.Been using them for a couple of weeks, and so far am satisfied with the performance.

This filters picked up so much dust and allergens, the air even smelled clean

I am glad I gave this brand a chance. These are really well made replacements for the original air filter. The used filter on the bottom pictured here was a regular filter and the yellow one on the top is the Pet Care filter.The filters came well packaged and I wasn't concerned that the product would have gotten damaged in shipping. I am using the box to store the second filter for now. But it is really nice knowing I won't have to buy another one for a while. Great deal to have two in one pack.

I am very pleased with these replacement filters.I've tried other non Levoit brand replacement filters and these are the best so far.They are nearly indistinguishable from the OEM replacements, at an excellent price.These have the same plastic mesh pre-filter as the OEM, rather than the cheap filter paper many others use.The fit and function is perfect. They have no odd smells as some other types do and they effectively reduce room odor and dust, just as they should.I highly recommend these Core 300 replacement filters.

The amount of allergens and dust that they trap is quite amazing. If you have pets this is a must have. I had a regular filter on my Levoit Core 300 but these work so much better because of the pets. If you have a Core 300 I recommend these over the regular filters for pet odors and pet dander. They work great overall for your other allergens. You will be able to tell the difference after the air purifier runs through its cycle. I highly recommend these.

Just like the original OEM filters that came originally. It also smells good compared with the old carbon filter that I tried (that one started smelling moldy). Once I put these in then it cleared up that smell. I had to also wipe down the inside and use air duster but now everything appears back to normal. Thanks!

This is a great set of 2 "pet" filters.  (the yellow ones being able to trap more pet hair apparently, vs the white ones which are normal type.)  I couldn't tell any difference with this, from the one I was replacing it with...so very good sign.  Looks pretty much identical, feels identical, and seems to be exactly the same in all ways.  And...I could smell the difference in air quality immediately...as soon I put this one in....fresh and clean out coming right out the top....excellent.  So these are great, work and fit exactly as they should...and I would definitely recommend.

These replacement filters fit my Levoit Core 300 air purifier perfectly. This is a good value for two filters, which will keep me stocked for a year. These look just like the manufacturer’s filters. I have the Levoit Core 300 in my foster kitten room, so I like using these yellow pet filters in that room.

I use these in my Levoit purifier that uses Core 300 filter refills.They fit perfectly and are about 1/4 the price that I had been paying via subscribe & save.I keep this purifier running 24/7 on my boat to keep the air fresh and love having cheaper filters so i can change them more often.

2 Pack Core 300 Replacement Filter for LEVOIT Core 300 and Core 300S Air Purifiers are a nice alternative to the official filter replacements. The cost is much better and the performance is just as good if not better. I like the pet filter on these. I have two 300s so the two pack is great for me. You can also clean these filters to increase longevity.Recommend

Exactly what I needed for my air purifier! Works like a charm AND it's a two pack!

Perfect fit. Perfect seal. Seams to work great. Air smells clean coming out. I assume this is doing the job. It does seal better then some other 3rd party filters.

Love the price. We were. Using more expensive ones, and these work great. And are half the price.

Bake Choice Pre-folded Natural Unbleached Coffee Filters are great. These filters are sturdy, ensuring a perfect brew every time without any grounds slipping through. I appreciate the natural, unbleached design that doesn't affect the taste of my coffee. The pre-folded feature makes them super convenient and easy to use. I used to buy a different brand in the past that was more expensive, but this one provide a better value for money.

I've been breaking the bank to buy filters for my chemex for far too long.  These filters work just as good and cost half the price.  They hold up well under intense heat, but rip a little bit easier than the chemex filter, but that shouldn't be a problem unless your a weird coffee fiend like me and squeeze the filter out after brewing to get every last drop of coffee.

Love these and we have these filters on our auto order.

I’ve used a few of these filters. They do the job and that’s all that’s important. I think they should be a dollar or 2 cheaper ‘cause they cost as much as Chemex filters

Box provides a nice holder for your filters. Will reorder.

I’m a bit of a coffee snob. I wanted to save a few bucks by buying these cheaper filters, but they simply don’t work as well. They drain too quickly so that the coffee isn’t strong enough and winds up being flavorless. With the Chemex filters, it would take a couple of minutes for the full carafe to filter the water. With these, it drains almost instantly. I spend too much on single-origin beans to not be able to taste the flavor, so I’m going back to Chemex.

Great price but little flimsy!

These filters do what they’re supposed to do. I gave them 4 stars due to the paper dust they shed prior to rinsing— not something I’ve found with Chemex-branded filters, but a minor issue given that these are meant to be rinsed prior to use.

Great filters for Chemex. Love that they’re unbleached and more affordable than other brands.

Good quality & idea, but my husband bought these & I don’t want to use now that I see that they were made in China! So disappointing.

If it matters to you: these are made in China, not in Canada.  I chose to return my order and order the Chemex brand which is made in the USA.

Unfortunately.  I hate the price of Chemex but you gotta do it

For whatever reason the Chemex brand are just better. These don’t drain well, the paper is flimsy and they leak out of the top. It’s worth the extra money to get the better brand. Especially considering I love my coffee routine in the morning and it just makes it a little messier. Do they work? Yes, but with more hassle.

I only make pour-over cups of coffee, so this i not a new concept, but I don't get these filters.  They are folded like a square napkin.  Do I need a class in how to make this giant square a cone filter?  Apparently so.

I have another batch of off-brand Chemex filters, though they are unfolded and a pain to take out of the package and manage given their large unfolded size. They are also in a very thin plastic wrap that makes them flop around so they are harder to store upright without wedging them between something.In comparison, these are pre-folded and come in a cardboard box that makes them much more manageable, with a lid to help keep ants and etc out of them.I never could find official Chemex filters for a reasonable price, I get the impression they are much thicker and provide a cleaner cup of coffee than these filters, so if your after something to give you Chemex-grade filtering these probably won't fit your needs. These are almost identical in thickness and texture to my cone filters for smaller pour-over systems, just lager so they can fit a Chemex. If your not a fan of Chemex's signature taste and want something more typical though, these should be fine for that. I always rinse my filters, and didnt taste anything unusual in my coffee compared to my other filters.Personally, the form factor and the box make these a good product for -me- and I'm happy with them, though the price is a little high for only 50 filters at about $7.99. That makes it about 16 cents a filter which I suppose is not too bad, though you can certainly beat that with a little luck and patience.

A great, more affordable, option as compared to the oem filters for my chemex. The filter really makes a difference. These result in a cleaner cup than pleated styles.

Great product!

We recently switched to using a pour over coffee carafe. These fit our 10 cup carafe very well. They are sturdy and easy to use. I got a kick out of folding the filters. Our coffee tastes great, very clean.

I like these because you can use them more than once

Works well in our 6 Cup Chemex Carafe.

And not bleached paper, another perfect!  Thanks for having something I can't find local!

Nice coffee filters, work great with no issues! Would buy again.

I have a number of different coffee brewing options at home and in my office and enjoy using my Chemex brewer very much. As with a number of other brewers I have, you can't just use a "regular" coffee filter.These coffee filters work great, they're thick but allow the coffee to seep through easily. I haven't noticed a smell or off taste using these filters.Overall, great filters that will work well for you.

I ordered this pack of 50 Bake Choice Pre-folded Natural Unbleached Coffee Filters to use for filtering photographic chemicals.I sometimes use analog photographic processes that involve chemicals.  Typically, these chemicals get reused.  Sometimes, as they age, the begin to develop crystallization or other impurities.  These impurities can have a negative effect on the process you might be using, so they need to be filtered out.  I've found that the best way to filter most of these chemicals is with coffee filters.The problem with a lot of coffee filters is that they are 1) too small, or 2) not strong enough.  These Bake Choice filters are large enough to fit even my largest funnel.  They are prefolded, so it is relatively easy to get them inside of the funnel.  They are nice and strong, doing a good job with filtration and then not falling apart when I remove them from the funnel to drop them in the trash.  I see no reason why they wouldn't work just as well as for their intended purpose -- making pourover coffee.

I love my Chemex coffee maker, and i use it every day. I have used unfolded filters for a while. You just have to fold them. The trouble is, I haven't had my coffee since I was trying to do this easy origami. So these filters are literally a no-brainer,They fit perfectly and are unbleached. They're a perfect thickness, so they don't break when you lift them out of the Chemex.They help me get coffee into my body about 45 seconds faster - perfect.

It fit in my chemex coffee brewer perfectly. Quality of the coffee filter is great. It's nice and thick. Much more affordable than the original one.

Nice filters, they work as promised. Easy to remove from the box. We're using these with our new pour over device which has a built in in filter so that we have less clean up. Very happy so far.

Good quality chemex style cone filters.  Works exactly as it should, rinse first to get rid of any paper taste and it's ready to go!

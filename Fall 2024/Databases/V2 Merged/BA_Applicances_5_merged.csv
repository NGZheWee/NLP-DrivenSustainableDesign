The 1X2 coffee filter fits it correctly. I have been buying 102 size for some time. Sometimes Amazon sends 1X2 size for 2-cup coffee filter, and this size is correct.

Although it is for 2 cups, I would still suggest that you pour water into it several times. Why? It's just the speed that water flows through is not even. If you pour 2 cups of water inside all at once, you'll surely get coffee that is too watery, because the water flows through very very quickly. Yet when the water reaches the bottom, it flows too slowly. I have to honestly say that this design is not as smart as the Japanese drip bags made of paper. It costs an extra ceramic cup, is clumsy, but doesn't do the job perfectly."

Da reißt nichts beim Durchlaufen des Kaffees oder man entsorgen aus dem Filterhalter.

Sie erzeugen Kaffee zum niederknien. Bei Verwendung einfacher Filtertüten stehen Leute oft vor dem Zwang spezielle Kaffees kaufen zu müssen, die mild oder magenschonend sind, weil nicht jeder Bitterstoffe und Öle gut verträgt. Mit den Melitta Tüten braucht man sich darüber weniger Gedanken machen, da die Aromaporen nur den guten Kaffeegeschmack und andere gute Stoffe durchlassen, während bittere Öle und Bitterstoffe im Filter verbleiben. Man könnte also durchaus sagen, mit Melitta Filtertüten wird so gut wie jeder Kaffee zu einem gut verträglichen Kaffee. Allerdings hat das nunmal auch seinen Preis. Diese winzig kleinen 100er Filter sind speziell für den Melitta Aromaboy im Sortiment, den ich selbst besitze und verwende und sie leisten darin hervorragende Arbeit."

Sie sind aus hochwertigem Filterpapier gefertigt und sorgen für eine gleichmäßige Durchflussrate des heißen Wassers, was zu einer optimalen Extraktion des Kaffeearomas führt.Die Größe 1 x 6 passt perfekt zu den meisten Kaffeemaschinen und Filterhaltern, was die Zubereitung unkompliziert macht.Die Packung enthält 40 Filtertüten, was eine großzügige Menge ist und sicherstellt, dass ich immer genug Filter zur Hand habe.Die Filtertüten sind geschmacksneutral und beeinflussen den Geschmack des Kaffees nicht. Ich bekomme immer einen reinen und aromatischen Kaffeegenuss.Die Verarbeitung der Filtertüten ist zuverlässig, und sie halten während des Brühvorgangs stabil.Insgesamt kann ich die Melitta Original 1 x 6 Filtertüten jedem Kaffeeliebhaber empfehlen.

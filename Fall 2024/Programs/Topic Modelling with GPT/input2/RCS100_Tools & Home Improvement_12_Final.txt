Easy to put together, and is a good size for folding chairs and cushions and pillows for outdoor furniture. Sturdy. Would buy again.

Super easy to put together, we bought two. Second one took less than two mins to snap together. Lid is a little flimsy as the hinges are new/strong but it's overall a great product

This deck box is certainly easy to put together. Probable took 15-20 minutes. It’s roomy & seems  fairly sturdy. I’ve not had it long enough o completely confirm how weatherproof it is. We’ve had a couple light rains & the inside has stayed dry. It looks nice & for what I paid, I think it was a good value.

Great size to hold all my pillows!

I was dismayed when I realized how difficult this was to assemble. Very difficult to snap the pieces together and to get the lid on required 2 people and extra tools. It is also rather flimsy. But, all that aside, it serves the purpose of keeping my outdoor items dry. But I will let you know after a New York winter.

The product arrived quickly from YITAHOME, excellent packaging well protected.  Great set of instructions and the assembly went without any problem and quickly.  The external look is perfect and beautiful, very roomy and sturdy.  We haven't had any rain to validate the waterproofness yet!  I highly recommend YITAHOME product for quality and value.

Perfect size box to fit all the cushions from my 4 piece patio set. It was all easy to assembly except the lid. There was no way to snap the lid on without using a hammer. Otherwise it was very simple to put together, about 15 minutes. It’s a great size.

Completely warped, hydraulic arms are garbage. A complete waste of money. All damage done within a week. If you plan on using this anywhere outside, look elsewhere.

Easy install for 1 person. Sturdy. Decent weather proof. Bought a 2nd like so much

I'm not sure why so many people struggled with the assembly. While it wasn't something I was used to, the pieces were labeled and the pictures were easy to follow. I was nervous at first to put any pressure on the pieces to get them into place, but it worked out fine. I'd suggest looking closely at the pictures and making sure you have everything lined up properly before committing, because I'd imagine this would be near impossible to get back apart.For all pieces but the lid, I was able to just gently apply pressure after getting the pieces lined up. For the lid, I simply laid it out like the pictures showed and pressed gently with my foot to lock it into place.At the end of the day, it feels a little flimsy to me and I wish it were sturdier feeling. I do like that the lid holds itself up so that I can easily pack items in and remove them. I ordered a cover to help with the water resistance, because I don't expect that this will be very waterproof.At the end of the day, this box is going to work for me, but I wish I would have paid a little less for what it is (If it had been sturdier so that someone could sit on it, for example - I'd be very happy).

I have watched the assembly video several times and studied the enclosed directions.  I've labeled all the parts since some were not stamped (B, C, etc.) by the manufacturer.  I have a rubber mallet.  I can't even get the first C part into the B part.  I am afraid to force it.  I don't see how they are supposed to go together and would appreciate any suggestions.  I wish I had read all the reviews before I ordered this thing.

Very cheap, flimsy plastic material.  Some of the corners were already cracked and pieces falling out when we unpacked the box.  Way over priced, should cost a third of the price.  If you’re going to spend this much, find one with a stronger and sturdier material.  I do not recommend.

The lid does not close properly.  Amazon sent us a replacement.  The new top is worse than the other.  I will need to put something heavy on the lid to ensure it is closed and the items inside do not get wet when it rains.  I wouldn't purchase again.

This was so difficult to put together after 1 hr and only had a side & base.  I’m sorry I’m pretty good about putting furniture & such together. Totally disappointed

After putting the box together and having to work hard to get the last piece to lock in I have been very disappointed with how it has held up. The sides of the box have warped and no longer line up so it can’t shut all of the way. For the price i would have hoped it would last longer than just 2 months

Assembly basically involves “jamming” 4 cheap pieces of plastic together. Mine already had a piece that peeled off of it. Seems like it was 3d printed in someone’s basement and then slapped with a $200 price tag. Can’t recommend against this product strongly enough.

Haven’t had this product for more than a month and the lid has already warped beyond my ability to fix it. No longer weather proof.Do not buy.

The assembly instructions we received in this package were for a different type of storage box so they didn’t apply to ours. Without instructions we didn’t know the order in which to assemble the pieces and the frame broke apart when we tried to clip the pieces together. A huge waste of money.

I’m returning it! We are very unhappy! It’s way to small for a deck! Its more suited for a 3 year old child’s toy box

I have had this item for 3 months and now the lid won't close so dirt and rain are getting in rendering it useless as an outdoor chest. Amazon will not refund it. Use Wayfair.

Doesn't close tightly.Inside measurements are different that what stated in reviews.

Hello I am writhing because your deck box isn’t closing properly can you help me

This box is good enough but as soon as it is warm outside it warps and does not close properly.

Lid is warped and doesn’t close properly

If I could give a negative 5 stars for ease of assembly I would. Two pages of the instruction manual are completely blank. Piece of crap that will likely get returned.

Product did not include all of the parts required to assemble. Despite having purchase the product only a few weeks ago, we cannot return it.

Arrived damaged. Pretty easy to assemble. Would definitely not buy again. Too Flimsy. Don’t expect much protection. Hopefully it keeps the cushions dry during storage.

Totally leaked - first rain - piece of junk

THE LID DID NOT CLOSE FULLY. WATER GOT INTO THE DECK BOX DESTROYING MY CUSHIONS AFTER IT RAINED.

Lid will not clip in. Cannot find customer service number to request new part

Lid does not go on.  Useless piece of crap

Not very durable, moves with a little wind

Super flimsy definitely not worth the money shop else where!!!!!?

Missing instructions and piece of inside junk

Not sturdy does not keep water out

These type storage units are a joke!  They don't stay together, they are not easy to roll and they cannot be used as 'extra' seating.

Super flimsy! Cheap plastic. You would think it would be more sturdy since you're paying a lot but nope!!! I would NOT trust anyone to sit on it like a bench.

This box is not sturdy enough to sit on (at least I wouldn't trust it).  It has very thin plastic walls and lid.The positive side is the closing brackets allow for a slow, silent close of the lid.Not air or watertight at all, but it will store cushions and outside supplies well during summer use .

My husband put it together with no problems.  I placed my new cushions and went to retrieved them a week later and ..... full of large ants that had laid babies.  Other bugs do not know what they were.  Lid would not seal tightly but I had placed to plants on each side to keep them seal tight.  You can see holes where they snap together.  Very disappointed.

Item arrived damaged. One side is broken. Took pics but this app won't upload them.ON EDIT: After finally getting the pictures to upload (it took many attempts, and I think the Amazon app was acting up at the time) the company refunded my money without any trouble at all. The product may have been damaged upon arrival, but the company offered the best outcome and I praise their customer service.

Was disappointed that the box was not waterproof. The first big rain and the bottom of my chair cushions were wet.

....and that’s a load of BS.Pieces just would not budge. My hand in the pic is pink and blotchy from all the abuse I had to put it through to just try to “snap” these stubborn pieces into place. Worse, the walls aren’t even that sturdy, just the pieces that are “supposed” to go together.

Not easy to assemble. A little “cheap” looking 👎🏻

The reviews usually are right on but not this time. This is not worth the money. It’s not sturdy and it says a 400 pound person could sit on this. I’d pay to see that

Tion at off broke hinges on Nodules

cover get curved after 2 days, doesn't cover all the way. Not water provedhard to return, how i can put back in the box

Took to long to put together. Did not seal tight. Disappeared

I have had problems with the lid since I bought thisThe lid bents on the corners does not close

Put a tarp or something underneath when you are assembling. I scratched it all up trying to put it together. It was very difficult. I still don't have the top on properly 🤦🏻‍♀️

For the money I thought it would be a little bit better quality, the lid does not shut 100% and the shocks are a little overpowering for the flimsy top

Cheaply made

Must apply heat when trying to get those hinges in on the second to last step.  It seems almost impossible without warming up the plastic.  I'm glad I was able to follow the heat advice that others posted.  Other than that it was an easy install.  It looks nice and seems pretty strudy.

It is very sturdy and easy to assemble, but it does not always shut all the way on the front corners which makes me nervous for when it rains.

Like it a lot.

Not what I expected as a sturdy storage box

Lid is flimsy and warped

It’s cheaply made

Missing the screws

After one month the front panel is bulging out and the top doesn’t fit.  I have to put my knee against the front panel before closing the lid — then only one front corner stays intact.  Disappointed.  It’s good looking and has room for our cushions.  Easy assembly.  Reasonably attractive. Does the trick for storage. Just not convinced that it will keep things dry based on the imperfect connection  of the top to the bottom.

The assembly instructions are horrible.

Only average quality. Water leaked in through the bottom.

I just finished putting the box together and noted a few things that could be clearer in the description. 1) The item description says waterproof but when you read deeper it says water-resistent. Two different things. Since I can see daylight though the toggles on the bottom, water can easily get in so 'waterproof' is doubtful.  2) I don't see how the lid acting as a seat, can hold 440 lbs, as stated in the 'extra seating' description. I wiegh 49 kg and there was sufficient give when I sat on it.  It a says capacity 440 lbs, which presumably doesn't mean as a seat. jsOther than that, it was pretty easy to assemble (directions are overly simplictic) and should fit my needs.

Deck box was stated that is was waterproof.  I had it setting on the lawn and water seeped into the bottom.  I moved the deck box to a concrete pad and items inside remained dry. The basket weave pattern is nice but collects alot of dust. Next time I would purchase a deck box with a flatter pattern. Other than that, it is very sturdy and the black deck box looks nice with my decor.

This is a decent purchase but watch out for defects in the front left corner panel that prevents the lid from closing securely. Hubby bought some latches and installed those on each side to ensure a nice fit close.

Bought this to store cushions and pillows. Assembled easily.  After reading reviews about the corners bowing up I bought some latches, tiny bolts, and washers and put one on each side since this is in full sun most of the day. Used plumbers tape to seal from moisture.  Problem solved! Took about 20 minutes to put them on.We had heavy rains and I found no evidence of moisture inside the box.Lid could be sturdier but happy with this purchase.

This is good for what I need it for however, I couldn't put it together.  My son had to come over and do it and it was difficult also for him to snap it together.  Took longer than it should have.  I have it on my condo covered balcony for storage of house hold items I hardly use.  I needed more shelf space inside so this works good for for that.

The length is slightly longer to fit two patio cushions side by side.  Otherwise, it is a great product.

Was more difficult for me to put together than I would like to admit. My neighbor was able to come over and put to together quickly. So if your a smaller person or have sever back problems please ask for help with assembly. Must be sat on a level surface to close properly. Quite difficult on gravel. That is where I took points off for waterproof. I know user error....

They are nice ..Lots of room..But the Sun warps them..I live I dessert heat though.

was difficult to assemble. need 2 people to put it together. was hard to get pieces to snap together. looks to be sturdy enough and waterproof. i have it sitting on cement porch.

It will service my requirement, but the lid REALLY needs more reinforcement. It torks like crazy when you open it, which over the years and UV degradation will break. I'm going to screw a metal bar across the top front so it can't tork anymore.

The directions are missing key points.  It was frustrating and took way longer than needed.  Clearer directions would be very helpful.

I recently order this box. It took some time to put together since it needed some figuring out beyond the manual, but not bad.It was outside for a month now and looks the same. It holds lot of items. We have our previous plastic bin inside with all (about 10) towels, plus water shoes, toys, hammock and still lots of room.  I can't wait to put inside all the pillows once summer is over.The 4 stars is because the lid does not evenly close if pushed only from the center. You need to push from both corners if you don't want one side to be slightly open.

trying to pop the panels in place is like pulling teeth but when the pieces are together it's a great storage box

1) the associated videos make it look like it's a breeze to assemble, it isn't.2) The parts aren't clearly labeled to match the instructions. How difficult could it be to mold the part ID into the part itself. If you stare at the parts long enough, you can figure out which part is which.3) The video shows someone sitting on it. That might work for a bit, but certainly not two people at the same time. The pieces are just strong enough to hold together and not any stronger.

Only thing wrong was a defect in the latch to attach the lid. we gave up trying to solve it and just pick up the lid each time. it's too big to go thru the trouble of returning it. Really nice storage space for my rugs.

Not as water proof as described but otherwise great deck box.  Easy to assemble.

The lid was difficult to assemble I ended up cracking parts of it during assembly. I provided this information to the company and they were very eager to assist offering great customer service following my purchase. I would not have an issue purchasing products from this company in the future because of the timely and sincere effort to provide friendly and effective customer service following my purchase.

Perfect for porch storage

tried adding the hinges and the product is missing a hinge and the appropriate screws.  Any way I can get those sent to me?

too hard to put together

When I first ordered this product there were some issues with the instructions but overall it worked out great. Customer service was fantastic and overall product seems to work well

Not bad.  Withstood recent rain.  Does not seem as strong as it looks, but we’ll see.  Went together well.

This is a great deck box.  It holds a lot of stuff and looks good on our deck and is definitely waterproof.  We are very happy with the purchase.

Decent for the price. Attaching the lid was the most difficult part but I used a blow dryer to heat the plastic.

You can not over fill the storage box, it will bent and then you can't  close it. The great news is it is waterproof

Perfect size box to fit all the cushions from my 4 piece patio set. It was all easy to assembly except the lid. There was no way to snap the lid on without using a hammer. Otherwise it was very simple to put together, about 15 minutes. It’s a great size.

Love this organizer using on front porch for shoes etc..Love it!!

We love it. Installation is very easy and very sturdy for the cold weather.

This deck box is just what I wanted and needed for our deck to store outdoor items out of the weather. The first few pieces were kind of hard to snap together but after that it was pretty simple to put together. I love that it looks like wicker but it’s plastic and water tight. It looks great with other outdoor furniture. Highly suggested as the price for the same thing in big box stores is nearly double.

This is the second product purchased from this seller, and once again, lived up to what was advertised and the quality is great! Easy to assemble and sturdy! Great product!

This deck box is easy to assemble and the perfect size. There are no gaps on the side between pieces which helps ensure that rodents and rain stay out. It is very light weight so I would not recommend sitting in the top or anything like that.  Good investment for the money.

I bought myself one of these. Absolutely love it. It's not one of those usual unattractive deck boxes. Well, my daughter-in-law started filling it up with her stuff so I bought her one of her own for her birthday! I have since reclaimed mine. 🙂

Very attractive product. Sturdy

Easy to assemble with a spacious interior. The arms that keep it open are a great added value! Using for summer yard tools and kids stuff. Everything is in it and only half full. The lip for a lock seems to be small, but haven't done anything with it yet.

Great size for my couch and for chairs on the patio. Definitely wouldn’t sit on this though. Rain hasn’t gotten into the box but bugs certainly have. I might try to seal up the bottom or something so I get less pincher bugs in there.

Very easy to assemble and had it out on the patio in no time! Seems to work well so far though I wish there was a means to latch at the two front corners and not just the center.

Just needed a big, secure box for storing things in the back yard. Big enough to fit 4 lawn chairs, wood pellets & charcoal for the grill, garden hose, and a bunch of nick nacks. Handy. Sturdy. Subdued look that vanishes into the background.

I love this deck box. It was packaged well and super easy to put together. It fits my cushions for my small patio set with ample room for more. It opens and closes easily and overall looks great!

Easy to assemble, looks great and is perfect for storing patio cushions, my hammock and everything else I enjoy outside. Rains a lot here in Florida, and this box keeps everything dry.

Big storage area- can put a lot of equipment-waterproof and very sturdy- easy to put together- missing screws but did not stop from using- Bren through some heavy storm and winds.

Great for toys and towels by the pool

Bought one and we needed more room. Nice to have a matched set. Easy assembly and tight from weather. Would buy another if need more

It came quickly and was fairly easy to put together. It fits lots of cushions and looks great on my deck.

Delivery was good and on time. Assemble is easy. Put it at my back yeard same day and my wife was happy.

It’s bigger than I expected which I’m happy about. Put together quickly. Closes and opens easily

Bought this because I need a little more room for some extra cushions.  Shipped to me next day and assembled in 15 minutes.  Very happy.

Great quality, easy to assemble. Seems to be holding up in CA heat

very sturdy and top seals tight

Setting on our dock and is great in any weather plus very sturdy

This was great to store things in on our car porch! Durable and stylish

This is great!!Use a rubber mallet to hit the pieces together and it’s super simple!! Just make sure the pieces are laying how the pictures shows it before you hammer it! I threw it together in my living room in 20 minutes. And I’m a petite, pregnant, young woman! Lol.  It’s huge! Super excited to hide all the kids toys in this! Lol

We researched deck storage boxes for quite a while before deciding on this model.  It's huge!  Love the price, the look of it and the slow closing hinge.  It works so well that we  second one for our lanai!

Easy install for storage for sporting balls and misc. goods.

It was exactly what I needed for items I needed to keep on my deck

Easy to put together. So far seams reasonably waterproof

Very nice storage! Very sturdy.

Easy to put together, sturdy it is going to store our patio cushions great!

This product wasn’t hard to put together, for someone with experience, and it is sturdy and holds so much! We love it for our tools ⚒️

Product shipped fast. Super easy to assemble and very durable. Holds all my patio pillows and pool accessories. Great value. I preferred black.

Excellent patio box large enough to store 10 patio cushions comfortably. Easy to put together and love the metal lid supports!

Everything snapped together quickly for easy assembly. Best feature is the hinged lid that seals everything.

As advertised.

This product was just what I was looking for. It is lightweight and holds quite a few cushions

Very sturdy and lots of room. Definitely recommend!

We used this product for our pool storage. It's nice and big and very sturdy.

Love the storage ! 2nd time I bought

Easy to assemble. Large enough for loveseat cushions to lay flat

The box came on time and was not difficult (for my son) to put together.  We have had several hard rains, and the contents have stayed dry. So far I’m very pleased with it.

Great way to store patio cushions when not in use.  Stays dry even in downpours.  It did take two people to put together but was very easy assembly.

Really had a tough time putting together it’s snaps in place with a lot of pressure. Once assembly it looks great has plenty of room for storage.

Works great for my rooftop patio

The assembly instructions (Just a set of illustrations, no words) make only the slightest mention that the base of the unit is asymmetrical. (The notches on the sides of the base are not equal.)  If you fail to note the small "a <= b" in the illustration and assemble the unit it will not go together correctly.  Once the sides have snapped together there is no way to disassemble them to fix your error.  I bought two units and now one of them is trash because I assembled it wrong.The units come with a card offering product support but NONE is available.  If you call the phone number listed a recording will tell you they're either on the line with another customer or you've called after hours. I've called at various times over the course of several days but all I get is that recorded message. They do allow you to leave a message and they promise to call you back but don't hold your breath!  I've left a couple of messages but haven't received a call yet.Bottom line: Don't buy anything from this manufacturer unless you are perfect at interpreting illustrated instructions!

The box looks great but BOTH tabs that attach the lid broke during assembly.  Cannot find a way to reach Seller

I bought this deck box to store my Solo Stove and carefully checked dimensions prior to purchasing.  Unfortunately, the interior dimensions provided by the seller in its description of the product were incorrect and off by about 2” and my stove does not fit.  Once you assemble the box (not all that easy to do unless one is especially dexterous) it is near impossible to disassemble without damaging it making a return of the box impractical.  I  will never buy from this seller again.

For $90 I’d expect this to work as described. It does not have an option to lock, and the lid doesn’t even latch (it just sits on top of the other pieces) If you have ANY wind it’s going to blow the lid open. Putting together was easier than most have stated, but I’m very annoyed there’s no way to lock/latch the lid closed. Going to have to buy my own latch of some sort and install on the outside. False advertising at its best.

Did not notice it had broke screw boss until it was almost completely assembled. Because it snaps together and can't be taken apart I can't disassemble it to return it. It even says in the instructions that it can't be  disassembled once snapped together. Sent note asking how to move forward with returning it when it can't be disassembled with no reply. Think I'll just beat it apart to disassemble it to be able to return it.

Great idea and storage capacity.  Great service by seller.  However, assembly instructions are horrid.  Bought this in October 2021 and now 7 months later the lid and operators have broken and failed after opening and closing less than 20 times.  Hope to get the lid to just lay on top and stay waterproof to get some ongoing utility.  Otherwise this is Chinese made cheap crap.

Product arrived damaged beside the fact is is very poorly made screws for the hinges strip right out

Bought to keep towels and chemicals on my deck for my hot tub. Hinges don’t line up and difficult to open and close. When opened all the way, hinges pop out and lid won’t close correctly. Very disappointed in quality of this storage box.

To second another reviewer, assembly instructions were terrible.  Once assembly was achieved, it lasted approximately two days before one of the lid hinge screws pulled out of the lid and the lid bent like Beckham.

Within 20 days of assembling the box the lid was no longer fitting.properly. We have been trying to realign it with weights on the lidd to keep it in place, but it continues to slip apart as soon as the weight is lifted

The bottom piece was badly warped. Needed a second person to hold and a hammer to tap into place. Do not purchase this item. Regret not buying a suncast box.

Top faded to gray within 1 year only outside for 7 months total.Very disappointed in quality of sun fade

I have bought “resin” items before but this was more like thin plastic. One hinge broke while being assembled. It stores what we wAnt it to and because once assembled, there’s no way to disassemble it,  we kept it. Wouldn’t recommend.

The plastic parts were easy to fit together, but the hinges were not useable.

In all, the storage box is what I expected, however, I bought this to hold a half barrel planter/pot that will fit inside the box, but won't fit into the opening on top. The lip is simply too wide. I thought I had 2 inches to spare, but the pot is still about an inch too large to fit. I could probably take the whole thing apart and rebuild it around the pot, but the point was to be able to store the pot until I needed it again, not to make the pot part of the storage box.I will be able to use it for the other items I need to store, but that really wasn't the point. As far as sturdiness, this fits together well, and will work fine for a storage box. It is strictly a static storage box with snap and fit connections. It is not meant to be used for harsh conditions, including locations that are not level. It has enough overlap on all connections that it should be rain proof, but it isn't waterproof (meaning it can't sit in any standing water without risking water intrusion through the base and/or sides), And, it might need to be weighted down with a few bricks if it is placed in a windy area with a light load,

I purchased the small box. It was easy to assemble and seems to be sturdy.  However I'm disappointed that I cannot lock it, as the description leads you to believe. There is no hole or opening to place a lock in. I needed a locking box...wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. Aside from that, it's a pretty good product so far.

This box snaps together, no tools necessary. However, the inside is very sharp and 2 of my very expensive pillows and bench cushions were completely ripped open when we removed them from the box the first time. I would never use it for expensive items, it is rough and sharp inside. I'm so disappointed in this product, especially since I purchased two. Both will be returned. The cheapest selection is what you get at this price level.

When we went to put it together, notices some cracked areas and it was too small for our needs.  Sent it back without any problems. The company had wanted pictures, but we had already boxed it up.

We bought this because it said lockable. We need to keep raccoons out of the bird seed. It does not lock nor does it snap shut. A lot of money for six  pieces of plastic that snaps together and doesn't lock.

This box was exactly the right size for my patio chair cushions.  Easy to assemble and sturdy when put together.  Lid stays shut even in strong winds.  Cushions stay dry.

Easy to assemble and very sturdy. A value that you’ll be pleased with.

I have nothing but good with these so far. We got them during the summer and they held up being in sunlight all the time. We’ve had a few rainy days and everything has stayed dry inside. We us one for pool toys and the other for equipment and furniture cover storage. They are a little dirty in my photos but look just as good as outta the box. If you can read instructions they are overly simple to put together. Just take your time.UPDATE.I still love these boxes and think they are great. They still look good after 1 year in the California sun and have kept water out. However there may be some quality control issues. I ordered a 3rd large box to fill with more useless stuff for the pool. When the 3rd box arrived and I was putting it together I noticed that the strut arm assembly didn't sit well nor did the lid close like the others. I say this to say that the lid didn't close all the way when it was put together (in comparison to the lids on the other boxes). So I put my detective hat on and started to inspect the boxes for any differences. I found that the old boxes had the area where the screws go sticking out away from the side panel about 1/4 inch +/-. This space allows the hinges clearance to freely open and close (my 4th photo). The new box had this area flush with the side panel causing the issue of the strut arms not sitting well and the lid closing funny (5th photo). It ended up being a simple fix. I added a small plastic spacer and a new screw (6th photo) to have it sit where it should. All in all the boxes are well built and serve the intended purpose well but I dropped 1 star to reflect the defect found. I actually have a 4th box that is same style yet smaller size for another area in the yard. 1 small issue in 4 boxes isn't bad but I'm quite handy and saw this as a minor inconvenience. Another customer who might lack some DIY skills would be frustrated with spending the money for these and putting them together, only to find out they have an issue. I've read other reviews that state that you cannot return them once they are together. Once they snap into place the box can't be taken apart without breaking something. I'd still recommend them however pay close attention to my photos as well as other customers photos so that you can inspect them prior to putting them together. I hope that the company takes this information and provides a disclaimer in the box to look out for certain things prior to putting together. This is more of a defect rather than damage but the only way you would know it is once it was put together. Hope this review helps others who buy this item know what to be on the look out for, before putting it together.

Easy to assemble! Keep this on my uncovered deck.  Store gardening tools/supplies and ceramic pots. Have been thru multiple heavy rain storms and all is water tight!

I love the size of this.  It holds a lot of my ugly garden stuff.  Tarps, sluggo, supports, etc.  The directions took a bit to understand but just follow the letters and you will be golden.

I needed something sturdy on my deck to store two Adirondack chair cushions.  They fit perfectly with room to spare.  Top closes securely, too. It is under a covered porch, but even if it were more exposed, it is well made and I believe would keep the cushions dry. Happy with this purchase.

Works great as a package delivery box. Plenty of room, it's built sturdy, and it looks good. I put a half cinder block in mine to prevent it from blowing away in high wind. I also added a handle and stickers. Below are links to the additional items I added to the box.Package Delivery Signs - https://amzn.to/3JWAqs7Aluminum Alloy Sliding Barn Door Handle - https://amzn.to/3QFuiYV

I bought this to put by our pool for towels and a few toss toys. Size is good . It went together quite easy. It looks good by our black fence . the only thing I  do not love is the inside is not smooth It is  the reinforcing plastic. Kind of a waffle look.  other than  that all is good

Perfect to store our chair covers! Attractive, lid fits tight, waterproof and the price is great!

When reading the instructions I paid close attention to the fact that the arrow was pointing up and which pieces to put together first. What I didn't pay attention to was and it's very small print, is the fact that it is not a square base. The best thing to do is to look at the indentations on the sides of the base. You're going to start with the one side that has the smallest indentation. If you do that you'll save yourself a lot of headaches.Otherwise it's a great product. Perfect for the four cushions I needed to keep dry. Looks nice too!

I use these to store my furniture covers on the deck. Its perfect!

The storage box is well built and easy to put together.

I was looking for an outdoor storage box that wasent overly huge but not too small. This one was the perfect size! Assembly took some force which included me having to sit on it to lock the pieces together since I couldn't just push the side panels together. After the struggle of assembling the box, it really was very sturdy! Would definitely buy another if I need it!

This is very sturdy.  Looks good on the porch.  Great for storing outside chair cushions, bar-b-que/grilling  supplies, or garden tools and water hoses.

Easy to assemble and big enough for storing what we need.

The prices for the size is good and the assembly was easy

We have 3 of the extra large size outdoor boxes around our pool area.  I recently added 2 of these smaller ones.  One keeps all of the grilling/smoking items and the other is for dog stuff (toys, brushes, etc).  These are great and hold up so well.  They are in fact, weather resistant; a few of ours are under eves of the house and never had a drop of water in them.  Very nice to be able to hide your junk and keep it all in one place.

Love product perfect fit well constructed great buy

This medium deck box is absolutely perfect for my needs. Just what I was looking for! It looks very neat. It was very easy to put together. I assembled it alone and it literally took me only minutes to do. I had no difficulty with the instructions. We just had some very heavy rains here and I’m happy to say that the box is water tight. No moisture got inside at all! I would not recommend sitting on it because I don’t feel that it’s built to hold or support any weight on top. I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this product.

I assembled the 51 gal. deck box in about 15 minutes without needing any tools (although some may find a rubber mallet useful).  The bottom and 4 sides snap together then the top snaps in place with two molded in "pins" providing the hinge.  The plastic panels seem fairly sturdy so at this point is just a question how well does it hold up over time.  I'm using the box on my patio to store 8 chair cushions for use with the chairs at my patio table.  Each cushion is approx. 18" square by 2+" thick and the box was just large enough to hold all 8.

I purchased this box to store leftover chicken feed, treats and a bag of wild bird seed. Great size for what we wanted, and so far it’s going well. I hope it stays dry inside. Instructions were very clear and the box snapped together quite easily with a few light taps of a hammer. It feels sturdier than I expected with it being so lightweight. We shall see how well it does in the weather :)

I love my 51-gallon storage box.  I'm using it to store my rocking chair cushions and it still have plenty of room to store more stuff.  It took less than 5 minutes to assemble.  The instructions were very helpful. Follow the arrows of the 6 pieces and you're done! I was love that it is sturdy and had good weight to it.

I keep towels in here next to my hot tub and they are always completely dry. No leaks! Very nice box. I’m curious how it will hold up during the winters!

This was the only deck box on the market the right size for our 4 chair seat cushions. It assembles easily with only a rubber mallet. We had no trouble putting it together and the lid closes perfectly. It is attractive for black plastic. The medium size means that it doesn't take up as much precious space on our deck. It will function nicely as an extra surface for serving. So glad we spent the money on this one!

Good size, light enough to move around easily, and no leaks!  Very happy with it.

This is so easy to put together and the quality is great.

I use this for storage on my porch. I wanted a black one that can be used for a seat or table. This one is perfect for my needs. It snapped together easily and seems sturdy. I may purchase a second one.

Easy to assemble, tons of storage room! It also says that it can be used for seating and it does seem to hold at least 300 pounds.

Perfect size to fit my 8 - 17” square cushions.

I bought this to house all my deck furniture covers. Perfect! I have it on my deck as an extra table.

I bought this for a Fedex drop box. It was very easy to put together. I think it is going to work well.

Just got this and rained very hard last night - Every patio cushion inside was bone dry!Easy to put together, although I used a rubber hammer to make sure all sides, bottom,. topwere tight.  I would buy again and recommend to anyone.

I like this. Easy to assemble, has held up well and spacious.

This works perfectly on my tiny balcony but I worry that the lid will not stay closed in high winds.  I just put something heavy on top and it’s working for now.  Easy to put together.  Sturdy.

Have ordered twice because it was very useful and needed more outdoor storage  Good custoemer service

I put this beside my grill to hold all the needed tools such as charcoal, tings, chimney starter, paper, lighter, etc. All stays dry and looks great next to my black grill

I use this on my patio to store garden supplies.  It looks nice and resists water and moisture from the rain. Wipes clean easily.

Easy to assembleA bit larger than similar boxesThis will keep deliveries safe from weather and curious puppies.

Assembles in minutes. Weather proof, and that's proven by the unexpected wacky weather we've been getting here in Maryland. 3 sets of chair cushions fit snug, but completely inside the sealed compartment.

Love this and it's pretty!

Solid and as expected

liked the fact that it was a deck box but could also be used as a table

This is easy to assemble and sturdy. The size is perfect for our deck and has ample storage space.

There was an issue with the screws not fitting. Seller was quick to refund money.

Great product and easy to assemble

Awesome for use but not easy to put together

Very well made and water proof.

I am using it to protect my oxygen concentrator from the weather. I have it on the back patio so I don’t hear the concentrator running  I cut ventilation holes where the handles are and drilled a hole in the back for the power cord and oxygen tubing.  So far so good.

Required 2 persons to assemble. Was not lockable as described. Good price for the size. Works for me.

I bought this to store hardwood pellets for my pellet smoker.  I keep it on my back deck.  It keeps rain and weather out and works like hoped.  Easy to assemble and looks good.

I am not really one to gripe or complain, and I know “you get what you pay for” but this product is not what you want for your pool deck.  (1) the hardware was scattered through out the box (2) the holes for most of hinges where misapplied (3) the bottom will not snap in (4) most of the screws were too short.  If I did not have a jar full of screws this would have been a big pile of plastic.  I had to make it work.  If there is anything at all to say something nice about would be the hydraulic cylinders for the sides.  What should have been a 30 minute fabrication took 4 hours just to get it in place for its intended use.

Received obviously browned product that someone else had started to assemble. We had paid for new. Cracks and broken areas. Very brittle material. Amazon terrific and accepted return.  Different deck box bought from Amazon.

Please don’t waste your time and money. This is made out of very cheep plastic and it very weak. Hi Home Depot or Lowe’s and buy something strong. I’m sending back .

Arrived just fine, but on trying to assemble I noticed how flimsy the material is. Trying to snap it together without breaking it was impossible for me. After wrestling with it for too long and too many cracks in the product I just threw it in the dumpster, went to club store and bought a different brand. That one snapped together in 10 minutes and is twice the material quality.

I liked the color, but the walls were flimsy and there was no actual flat floor ; just the construction angles jutting from the bottom. I would have to construct  a flat surface to this for storing things.I missed a step by accident, as I let my 16 year help me assemble this. Before we were finished, it was too late. We could not pull it apart or disassemble it.I don’t like to assemble anything, but I DO like the forgiveness that you can always go back and try again. When I emailed the company, the rep replied ‘we warned you!’ , and they did in the manual. All I asked her was there an OPTION to redeem your error. She said ‘we warned you’ and did not give me any idea how I could redeem my error. I won’t ever buy this product again for the above disappointments.  Now, I am stuck with a large storage box that will not be weatherproof and will allow the elements to come in.It’s too large to fit in my car to take to Goodwill, too.  And…. You could not disassemble it to give it away! I wasted $150.00 plus.

I have put a lot of stuff together hard stuff trust me this is not easy to put together I've been trying for over one month it is about to be set out by the trash because that's what it is. I'm very disappointed. I got it to snap it still fell apart do not buy this product!!!

A box with four sides, one bottom, one top, should clearly include six panels total. I received five panels, with zero instructions.

We opend fixedHalf of it and saw the other piece is defective…Hard to return and sad to keep

No place is it said that assembly is required!!! Now what do I do?? I’m 80 years old

This is a piece of junk. Very cheap plastic. I had It all snapped together, It felt very sturdy, and then after a gust of wind the lid blew up and the cheap plastic attachments immediately snapped and the top broke off. It is clearly very cheap plastic, It has no latch to ensure it stays closed, I am returning this.

Directions was almost impossible to read, when someone orders a item that has to be put together, then the seller should make sure the directions are clear enough to read, my daughter has 20-20 vision and she couldn’t even read these directions, and the pictures were even worse

This deck storage box is incredibly flimsy and very poorly suited for an outdoor environment subject to even slightly harsh weather. As well, the assembly instructions predominantly rely on pictures without supporting text, and the pictures are generally so dark it’s nearly impossibly to see important details necessary to correctly put the box together. Laughably the box includes a hasp for locking the lid, presumably to secure the contents. The box is so cheaply constructed you could cut through the top or sides with a box cutter. Save your money!

This is one of those purchases you unfortunately immediately regret upon assembly. Looked good on paper, but clearly we made a bad mistake. Instructions are the standard Chinese unintelligible garbage, followed by missing parts, along with a few extra parts you don’t need (there’s something new!), and overall looks and feels like it is made out of cheap cheap cheap plastic. The tolerances are terrible and the “suggested” rubber mallet is an absolute must if you want to muscle it together. Just a bad experience for a product that’s not inexpensive. I dunno Amazon, you might want to start vetting sellers a little bit better. It’s YOUR on the line here.

The product came on time and was not damaged. However, it was missing the screws required to put it together!!! I tied calling the seller, but their phone number does not actually go through to anyone. The way this thing is constructed seems rather cheap and a am doubtful it will really keep the water out or survive being moved around at all. It is also harder to put together for one person than you might think. I complained through Amazon to the seller about the missing parts and they were slow to respond. When they finally answered me, they told me they don’t know how to overnight the missing screws and would give me 30 bucks to go fend for myself and find new screws elsewhere. I would never buy from this seller again.

We were so excited to find what we thought was a sturdy storage chest for our patio. We thought the price was a bit high, but chose to purchase it anyway because we needed something sturdy that could double as a bench. Boy were we wrong. The piece hardly fits together, the slots were twisted, brittle, and not square so the corresponding piece would not fit and snap together. After much wrangling, the whole long side piece broke at the bottom and split wide open. It sits crooked, and out of square, leaning to one side because the pieces fit so poorly and won't stay together. I don't know what to do, the box has been cut up and thrown away so I cant return it. Shame on me. I should have stopped at the first issue, packed it up and returned it. It will be going in Monday's trash.

Terrible. It's seating in the corner nor put together.

This was by far the worst thing to put together! I’m fairly handy & capable of putting things together. I did not have a rubber mallet, so I watched YouTube videos & they were just using their hand to click sides into place. I’m sweating, my hand is sore, & I put a hole in it! So flimsy!! Do yourself a favor & DO NOT BUY!

Very poor quality. Was already cracked when received.  Should be more durable to assemble.

This box does not come assembled as the product specs indicate.  The instructions for assembly are in French and some other language.  Assembly requires two people and a good knowledge of tools and medhanics.  It took two of us more than an hour just to figure out how to put it together from the pictures, and then another hour to manage the assembly.  No assembly tools are included.  Avoid this item!!

Purchased to protect deliveries from rain as we don't have covered porchDifficult to assemble and very flimsy.  Came apart after only a couple deliveries.Taped the corners to attempt to attempt to reinforce but not optimistic will last much longer. Should have returned but too late now.Lesson learned

I had to have 2 guys put it together for us.  It looked great, matches a trash container I got earlier for the deck.  But one of the base corners will not stay together.  It splits apart and leaves an open gap.  Not very Happy.

This is the second I've bought, I'm disappointed it's damaged. Inconsistent quality.

I followed the instructions and the parts obviously didn't fit. One is too small or the other is too big. I thought something is wrong with me so asked my carpenter friend to try and he said definitely wrong parts and no way those parts fit in.... It is weird because same color and look like made for same item.....I see someone said "D" is printed outside but mine is printed inside. So they mixed different boxes parts???So much hustle to process return for such huge item....

Do not purchase. Lids blew off and tore holes in the box within one week. Winds were only 10-15 at that point.  We had locks on the lid which I guess is why it tore the box as well. They are so not durable. So mad but guess u get what u pay for. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!

Horrible! The directions (and other reviewers) say the pieces just "click" into place and it's the perfect storage box. That's why I ordered it. But two of us worked on the blasted thing for an hour and NOT ONE SINGLE PIECE "clicked" into place. No clicks, no box. The parts absolutely refused to assemble together, fell apart every single time, like the entire thing was DEFECTIVE. I could understand if one corner didn't click and stay, but the whole thing???? Unbelievable. Needless to say this piece of junk is going back where it came from.

Had it for a little bit, broke after only having it for a few weeks. The quality is not good. Hope I get reimbursed because it was pretty expensive for size

Lid top broke clips on.

A piece got snapped together in the wetting order..... it was impossible to unsnap it without breaking it.  I sent a message to the seller with no response.  I ended up throwing it away.  I was so frustrated

Disappointed that the lid came out of the box with a crack. My husband showed me but put it together anyway. After put together I'm sad that the lid also has discoloration on it. Also, not super sturdy. Update, reached out to company for a new lid and got run around. Don't buy.

I bought this to store cushions for our outdoor patio furniture. It was delivered at 8:45 on a Saturday night. I assembled on Sunday morning with help from my teenage son. It wasn't terribly difficult to assemble and took us maybe 40 minutes.  After less than 8 hours of sunlight it was warped by about and inch and a half on both front corners. In addition, all 4 of the wall corners were cracked. I had read other bad reviews about the warping and ignored them. Don't make the same mistake. Just avoid this container and save yourself the hassle.

What an absolutely horrible piece of garbage. Two pieces can’t even stay together to get the thing assembled. I can’t imagine this thing lasts more than a week outdoors. At least I have scrap plastic now when I need it, how disappointing.

After only a few weeks in the sun, the lid is warped and it will not close properly. I still haven’t stored but just a few small kids toys in it. It wasn’t even a fourth of the way full and the lid is already crooked. Not a good value.

Unfortunately the panels aren't fully reinforced, so the sides bow out.  I use it to store patio pillows, and when you push then into the box, the sides bow out significantly and the bottom joints pop out.  Also, the top warps in the sun and doesn't rest flatly on the body of the box.  It also makes the box look cheap and flimsy--it's not sufficient for deck furniture.  Also, because the lid warps and doesn't lie flat, it allows driving to get in as well.  Requires 2 sets of hands to to put together, but definitely not worth the effort.

I wish I could give this zero stars.  Seriously.  The directions are beyond useless.  You need an engineering degree to put this together, and I still have a nasty bruise on my hand from pounding it together.  Possible broken hand.  DO NOT BUY!!!!

This item is made so cheap that two of us worked at it for an hour and can’t get it together! Terrible! Trying to return it is almost impossible and you have to pay to return. Do not purchase!!!

Who ever designed this box wa a real piece of work. This is nearly impossible to get out together by yourself due to a few interesting design choices of locking pieces. 10/10 would not recommend if you’re a single person.

I purchased two of these and both of them had broken and caps, not due to delivery but cheap plastic rattling around in the box and these cracks occurred. I would not recommend buying these whatsoever.

Although the storage box was easy to assemble, the quality is terrible. We haven’t even used it, and it has only been outside for a few days. Yet, there are already signs of wear and tear.  I definitely do not recommend this item.

This is not a sturdy box and unfortunately, the box in came in was damaged when I took the pieces out to assemble.  I am unable to return in the box.  We followed instructions carefully and when we assemble and lifted, the bottom fell out.  The base of the box has no screws and attaches by thin plastic lip that doesn't hold well.  I am so disappointed as this was a total waste of money.

Snaps together and will unsnap when you fill it and try to move it or pick it up. About all its good for is to throw it in the recycle bin!

Very badly made product with groove for the metal part on the lid is devective, does not fit at all.when I tried to return, said no return.  Really Amazon?  Why not?

The metal rods were bent in several places when we took it out of the box. No damage to the box, so obviously, they were bent prior to shipping.

I could have assembled the box incorrectly, but am disappointed with the lid as the corners curve upward after a few days in service.  Assembly was okay, but the material and structure of the lid is too flimsy and doesn't hold its shape.  I'm sure this will affect the box's ability to be "weatherproof".  Spend another dollar or two and buy a storage box that is better quality.

Mine is not yet fully assimbled.  Have spent hours, by myself, trying to connect sides to bottom.  No way one person can do it.  I would return the unit but repacking and shipping is out of the question. Neither water proof nor bug proof.  Stress from inside out will probabbly bread the box wide open.

This was one of the poorest construction I have ever bought. Unfortunately, it is too late to return. It has poor construction, the pieces do not fit together properly and it is not sturdy at all!

After we completely assembled, we picked it up to move it and the whole bottom of the box fell off. There is no way to completely attach it to the whole container. What a joke. Now we are stuck with having to use adhesive to get it to stay. Also, there are holes in the bottom so mice are able to get into it. DO NOT BUY!

Directions were not very good and material did not snap into place like it was suppose to. Very frustrating!!!

We bought the square size, after installing it couple days later, noticed corners started to shift which makes the lid doesn't work. i.e doesn't close securely.

Disappointed.  This piece doesn't even get full sun during the day outside yet the lid is already warping.  I would not purchase again.

Not very happy with the quality of this product. The parts came scratched and the lid cover has bubbles or air pockets in it.  Plus several of the screw slots were closed and not open all the way through making it hard to attach the lid.

I chose this storage box for its Storage space, and looks. The shipping box arrived in perfect shape when I opened the shipping  box I knew there was a problem when I saw shattered plastic pieces. The top cover was shattered, but no indications from the shipping box that could’ve made that impact. Additionally, there was other pieces within the box that were scratched, but I don’t think this was a return at one time. looking at the plastic pieces, everything looks very floppy and flimsy. I would assume poor quality control. It just looks like cheap and poorly made. The directions are poor as well could’ve been a lot better job showing what parts go where. At this point, I think you get what you pay for it wasn’t very expensive. I’m definitely going to spend more for better quality and learn my lesson.

Not really sure how long this thing will last. ?The hinges aren't very strong, kinda wobbly.  Plastic is bending outward where the hinges connect, almost like its going to break.

This bench is nice-looking and it has good storage capacity. But other aspects have made me dissatisfied with this purchase.The assembly instructions are primarily illustrations with very few words. So many questions arose during assembly for which there was no help in the instructions. It took several hours to put together and it was a really frustrating process.The plastic it's made of doesn't seem very sturdy. During assembly, we used a rubber mallet to help join parts--as directed in the instructions. But still, the plastic split along a seam as a result of being hammered with the mallet.  In addition, when we raise the lid holding by on to just one end, the plastic warps and bends down at the other end, and then, when closed, the locking mechanism doesn't line up.Another note: the design of the lid makes it hold rain water and snow melt. The lid has multiple grooves in it, but no way to drain the water that collects in those grooves. We open the lid after rain and snow to brush water off of it. I'm concerned that if water freezes in those grooves, the flimsy plastic will crack.

I really like this box, and it's very sturdy, however it is not white.  My deck is white trimmed and I was trying to match it. This is a very light gray, as you can see from the picture.I'm giving it four stars due to the coloring being off.Also, I have a eight piece sectional that has cushions. They do not come close to fitting. My cushions are about 25 inch square and they are too tall to close the box. No matter which way I turn it, they are too tall. So we ended up just using the box for yard tools. That's my fault for not measuring before buying it. Definitely do your measuring.Update: So we've had this thing about 6 months and as I opened it up for spring to start getting stuff out, I realized that we had squirrels or something living in it. There's no hole, so I'm assuming they're getting in from under the flap. It does not seal closed like I would like it to. As you can see from the picture, the right hand side is sticking up. It's still pretty waterproof just because the top is kinda mushroomed over the sides so the water drips off, but I'm not as happy with it as I thought I would be.

Item was damaged.  The top piece has a hole in it.  Getting tired of ordering items to have them arrive damaged.  Where is the quality control?

Very disappointed - with all of the great reviews, I expected a well-made product with fairly easy assembly. That's not what we got. The deck box parts are very sturdy and the hardware is high quality; however, the assembly is very difficult. We were unable to assemble it completely because it is impossible to attach the side panels to the bottom panel no matter what we tried or how we muscled it. Using a rubber mallet as suggested in the instructions didn't help.We've put together a lot of furniture over the years, like IKEA for example, so it's not a lack of experience that's the problem. The instructions that come with the deck box don't state when to attach the support bars to the side panels. The big problem is if you put the end pieces on without the support bars, it's impossible to disassemble and reassemble again. Without the support bars and without the ability to snap the side tabs into the bottom panel, all you have is a floppy deck box that won't hold together.I've contacted the seller and will update this review oif the issue is solved.

Not the best instructions and super cheap

Everything about this item looks amazing but the instructions lack in details of assembly instructions.

The concept is good but the quality is very poor. In order to close the lid, you have to adjust the sides. It isn’t sturdy by any means.

This was supposed to be easy to put together. Right from the start, the first step made no sense. The center piece in step one wasn’t the right size to fit the two side pieces. The picture showed it one way but no way would that actually work with what came out of the box. Another reviewer mentioned the same thing. Most reviews were positive, which is why I bought it. But no. Either my box had a wrong piece or the instructions are wrong. I was so bummed over this. I tried to create the box anyway because I needed it. But could not. Also I was not impressed by the overall quality of the plastic. It seemed rather flimsy. Find another deck box, that’s my recommendation.

I missed the half step of putting the metal pipes in it and had to spend an hour to take it back apart almost breaking it in the process.Please update the instructions to put the metal pipes in a separate step because taking it back apart is almost impossible.Later on in the process tho getting the lid screwed down was extremely hard. It should have been screwed down first then plastic snapped in.Structure seemed fine tho, and looks decent.

First, they should have made very clear which side is up and which side is down on the bottom piece (they didn't) - you have 50 50 chance of having the wrong side up and feel like you have to go to a mallet to hammer it in place, and if you hammer it hard enough (even with a rubber mallet), you will crack the semi-hard plastic in various places not only by trying to get it to stay in place but also in hammering it multiple times through sheer frustration because it just won't stay in place (see pic, only showing one of various places I had to tape up the broken parts!).  ...now if only they would label the bottom piece with "top/inside" and "bottom/outside", that would not have been a problem!  LOL!  OK, I'll take 50% of the fault here.  But to top that off, the top cover/lid front corners will curl up all by itself (see pic)!  That's 100% on the poor product design!

While the directions say its easy, it was manufactured quite cheaply and didn't just "click" as the instructions indicated it would.  It took an hour to get the pieces to work together finally and it still isn't the sturdiest.  But it will do for a deck box holding a hose and not much else.

I cant fit 2 24" cushions side by side! it is definitely not 55" wide!! Im so upset because it took me a long time to put it together myself!!!

Not good for packages. If it rains water gets through and does not drain out.

This isn’t sturdy if it’s on an uneven surface or a slant it won’t close properly.  I wish I would have spent more and bought something that would last longer

Pro: Arrived pretty fast.Fairly easy to put together.Has hinged door.Cons:Is NOT water proof.Missing a total of 11 screws (I bought 2 storage units) Had to go buy more.The slightest wind opens the door to the unit.Hinges do not seal unit.Plastic is flimsy.I would NOT buy again. Id like to return but I waited to long to put them together, past return window.

Worst directions and Assembly I've ever experienced. Absolute Garbage . Doesnt even give you enough clips to hold the last bar. Sides wont clip to base . Absolute nightmare.

I ordered this product and it came with no screws! We had to get our own. Not happy!

We opened this storage container and found mice or chipmunks got in and chewedup 7 sets of cushions! Cost $180!

Used this as a storage box on my deck for shoes. The deck box leaks so the shoes get soaked. Very frustrating because it is supposed to be used outside so should be leak proof which it’s not.

My husband said it was a pain to assemble, the lid doesn’t sit quite right, and it’s not closed to elements which I didn’t realize this is a drain version better for storing pool equipment. Meanwhile my couch cushions have spiders and other bugs happily living inside!

Too hard to put together

It's definitely not weather proof,  the lid has warped in just over a month both corners have raised 1/2 inch allowing water and debris to enter the inside

not easy to put together cracked aleeady

Never could figure out how to assemble the lid, pictures extremely unhelpful as was emailing the company.

Had to recut pieces.  Quality is poor

This takes about 3 people to assemble! Has really poor instructions. I will never buy Chinese again if I can find it made in the US.

Not at all easy to put together.

I’m a satisfied recent owner of the largest YITAHOME outdoor deck storage, but I was extremely disappointed and, frankly, embarrassed when I recommended this product to a family member and they went with the smaller 120 size.  The quality of the product and ease of set up is not the same.  The instruction manual for any size of this product needs improvement, but the installation help videos posted by others are extremely helpful (you just have to find them).  The pieces of the smaller size are not only flimsy and easy to crack but would not stay together in-spite of more than one attempt.  The amount of hardware for the smaller unit is a lot (39 screws alone) whereas the larger unit requires very few pieces.  And although it took less than a half hour to put together the largest unit, after spending an hour trying to get the sidewalls onto the smaller unit base, we were frustrated and left it for another morning.  Upon the second attempt, the sidewalls would not stay on the base.  As a consumer who had back-to-back experiences with set up of both sizes, please do not waste your time or money on the smaller unit.

Finished, the box will suit my needs. First, as the instructions say and Amazon ad should say, it takes two people, a drill that screws in and a rubber mallet to put this together.  The directions are horrible  and pieces are not well marked. After a misstep, it took a crow bar to separate pieces to fix it. The hinges are stiff It takes two to move it also so I wish I had looked for one with wheels. Not a pleasurable or bonding experience for my husband and I.

Be careful when putting this box together because the plastic isn't the best. Two of the tabs that are used to join the panels broke during assembly, and I wasn't putting a lot of pressure on it. Once the box is assembled, it seems stronger, but the tabs alone are a little fragile.

Easy to put together. There are letters on each piece A-E. Everything snaps together. It does help with 2 people to get the first 3 pieces snapped in. Its smaller than I expected- i measured my cushions-to the dimensions listed-and they should have fit- they are stuffed in there. Ill keep it as its handy for the deck.  More to come on if things stay dry.

Use this box on our patio to throw in the furniture covers. It’s not the sturdiest. But it does the job.

Assembly instructions were unclear!

The product overall is fine, though I would not venture to sit on it.  Maybe it would bear the weight of a small child.  But the main reason for my rating is because the instructions were horrible.  The written portions were in 5 different languages and it was obvious the writer didn’t actually speak any of them.  Each instruction was maybe one sentence and accompanied by a picture that barely showed what to do in the step.  Putting it together was about an hour due to puzzling out what exactly to do.  As a hint, do NOT overtighten the screws.  They get inserted into plastic and there is minimal bite so the risk of stripping is high.  Also, make sure you insert the horizontal box reinforcing rods after you put on the first side wall but before you attach the second one.  Taking the box apart significantly increases the risk of breaking it completely due to how the joins work.

I had this set up (in minutes - it's quite easy!) as a deck box for porch package deliveries. Within a month, the hinges broke on the top, but the company sent an entirely new box to make things right. If this one lasts longer than a month, I'll come back to update the ratings.

Flimsy material which makes it very difficult to put it together, after it is together (using a rubber mallet), the box serves the purpose.

assemble not so easy snapping together

Relatively easy to put together, a rubber mallet is your best friend, and don't be afraid to use some umph to lock things in place. It's necessary. At first I was very impressed, and it is a very large size. It's attractive looking and I was able to sit on it. But after only about a month of light use out of nowhere all three bolts on one side just came out! The hinge popped out and I can't get it back in, and I have no idea how all this happened.  This has made me lose some confidence in this product. A compromised lid compromises the items inside. My best guess is weather, we've had a lot of wind and changes in temperature.  If after I fix it it starts to give me confidence back I will update my review.

This "30 gallon box" has the exact same dimensions as 22 gallon boxes (easy search on Amazon).  22 sounds more plausible.  Not a chance it holds 30.  It's light weight, but would get the job done for small packages. I added a handle and sign for delivery drivers.

I got this to use as a package box / locker for my curbside packages from ups, FedEx, usps so I can keep my front gate closed. The item snapped together very easily. No bolts or tools required. It’s not a very strong or sturdy bin but gets the job done. If a heavy package is put in the bin and leaning in the inside sidewall it pushes out the side panel and I have to snap it back together. If you are not putting anything heavy inside that is leaning on the inside walls it should be fine.

The lid was warped and wouldn't close completely on its own. Not sure if the alignment was off on the hinge or if the lid itself was warped. The item was returned.

Good sixe box.More of a taupe than light brown, too bad they didnt use metal lid hardware, would have made a much more solid attachment. Instructions are not complete but you can figure it out by pictures.Not sure this will last outside in a Illinois winter, so will have to bring in or cover.

Poor design. Instructions difficult to follow. Hard to put together. Would not buy again.

I bought this box to store my patio chair cushions. It took my daughter and I about 2 1/2 hours to put it together because we could not get one side to stay in when we got the other side in. Each time we hammered one side and the other side would pop out. We thought we had it all done and my son-in-law put it out on the patio and I filled it. Went out there today a couple weeks later to see that one of the sides came apart from the front panel. Not a very well-made product it needs to be put together at a factory and sold finished. And it’s definitely not waterproof because you can see air even when it is together. Would not recommend.

Storage container is okay, but the worst in instructions I have seen. Take your time putting it together or you will screw it up because the instructions have pictures, no actual instructions. Don’t think I would buy it again.

This is a beautiful outdoor box, I purchased to replace my existing… I only purchased this one because it said waterproof… ITS NOT, water can still get in all around the lid.  It puts together by these plastic tabs, one of mine broke because I can hear rattling now installed, but it’s still really sturdy feeling.  Also you ABSOLUTELY NEED MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO PUT TOGETHER.

Shipped quickly and in tact. I have only had it for a month so can't speak to durability just yet. It was okay to put together. I have had other storage units that have pieced together much smoother. One of the corners doesn't close 100%. It is possible I just got a slightly warped piece leading to this issue.

I like this overall, but we don't feel like we can put it anywhere where water could be an issue as some of the pieces didn't quite snap in correctly and that left some small gaps at the bottom. The imperfect fit made for tough assembly too.

Depending on what you put inside, it won't stand straight, so you can't fully close the lid. the assemble was a little bit pain in the ass and I am not sure if I can diassemble it. It seems impossible. So I don't know what to do when I decide to throw it away. A little too pricey for what it is.

So far it does seem to be waterproof.  That's the most important thing to me.However, because the plastic is very bendy, the assembly was extremely frustrating because it took a lot of effort to get the pieces to click together.Had the assembly not been so difficult I'd probably give the product an overall rating of 4 stars.

This is a nice box and was easy to put together except the cover does not fit correctly. It’s uneven on one side which I feel when it rains water will get in the box. Not sure if I’m keeping or returning. Very disappointed.

I originally wrote about the difficulty with assembly.  In response the company offered a partial refund. And by the way, and additional pair of hands made all the difference.  Thank you.

Works but it's not a long term solution. Very flimsy design. Get a friend to help with assembly.  Poor instructions.Was hoping for something more sturdy

This isn’t as easy to assemble as they say.  It should be just a click together box but the plastic is so rigid that I can’t get the box to click together.  I’ll keep working on it

Love the box. Put a lock on it to keep critters out. A squirrel chewed a huge hole through the top of it to get to the stored bird seeds!!!! Total bummer!

Plastic is a bit thin.

UPDATE:  in warm weather it warps a little making it hard to open.  This is a great product, sturdy, nice looking, and easy to assemble.  Holds enough cushions for love seat and two chairs with room to spare.

like it but it is described as white but it is light gray. disappointed.

You would think that the amount of money you spend on it then it would arrive assembled but no. The screws are a nightmare to screw in. The panels line up fine put its impossible to keep them locked into place.

This is a nice looking deck box when assembled, but the assembly instructions are extremely confusing (even though it's a simple box) and it took some frustrating trial and error to finally put it together. Besides, the overall quality / sturdiness of the product is just passable. The lid is slightly warped so it that it does not close tightly. I will probably leave a couple of rocks on top to keep it closed tight.

I ordered this box because it was advertised to be white and black.  It is actually grey and black.  I have nothing against grey, but it doesn't match the white furniture elsewhere on the deck, and I now must paint it.  In short, too much trouble to box up and ship back.  Just call it what it is.  Grey, not white.

It’s over priced!

I don't know long this thing will last.  It was a pain in the ass to put together.  I would do it with 2 people so one person can hold it together as the other person assembles it.  The material is a cheap plastic so we will see how long it holds up!

It is advertised as white, however it is NOT white.  This box is actually grey.  Buyer beware!  Otherwise the box is sturdy and works well for what I needed it for.

I thought it would be fine but one gust of wind and the top came flying off and ended up breaking the other hinge. 😔

Previous reviews led me to believe this item would snap together easily. That was not my experience.

Does the job but confusing to assemble

Rather expensive for 6 flimsy pieces of plastic to form a box.  The cover doesn't fit real snug but because it's the right size for my needs and waterproof, I'm keeping it.

Disappointed! Horrible instructions missing parts.  Hours trying. Can’t find missing parts and that aside instructions don’t show parts sent!  Refund please!

There were many small pieces and it took a while to put together.One of the plastic hinges was broken when I received the box, but we could still assemble it using the other two. Would still like to receive the 3rd one to reinforce it.

This is easy to assemble but it’s very cheap… plastic, not worth the money they charge.

Purchased this as it looked similar to previous one I purchase of a similar product that was sold out. However, this plastic material is much more flimsy than comparable product with larger capacity I bought for $60 less.

Great deck box—once you get it assembled! Took my husband 3 hours  to put it together and the directions were not helpful. Thought about returning it but spending most of Mother’s Day putting it together  made that sound counter productive.

Thus was a challenge to get together.  Tried my patience a lot.  I added casters and handles for better mobility.  Something they should consider.

Part of the assembly would be easier with two people. Large capacity. Haven't had weather with which to test its "weather-proof" feature.Seems a bit flimsy to cost so much.

The bottom part doesn’t really stay on, and it’s appears water is leaking through the bottom as well. You need at least 2 people to put together

It has plenty of space but it doesn't close evenly tight. The ends are warped on both sides so it looks cheap and bug or rodents could climb in

Bad quality

Ordered this box and it was delivered in excellent condition.  The assembly instructions leave a LOT to your common sense.  The pictures are not clear and the brief, multi-language written instructions with each picture are not easy to understand.  (Yes, my husband and I are both college graduates.)  During assembly, we had an issue understanding the instructions and I contacted the company directly - not through Amazon.  The person I was text-chatting with didn't know the answer, but I got an email within 24 hours with the best solution and we were able to complete assembly.Box is sturdy, strong, comfortable to sit on, looks great and works wonderfully for storing our deck stuff.  We've only had it out a few days, so i can't attest to the weatherproof claims.  It hasn't rained yet!The only reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the difficult-to-understand assembly instructions.

It was a little difficult for a single person to put together. Once done, good place to put pool chemicals or gardening equipment. Rain resistant.

This box was easy to assemble and so far water resistant. It has been outside for several weeks and is still off gassing. It is not ready for storage of anything that could absorb the odor. I'm hoping that after another month or two, it will be less smelly. It was tricky to find a lock that would fit it, and ended up going with a very thin corded luggage lock. The locking feature is mostly for show.

Pretty thin and flimsy, but I assumed as much from the low cost. This box will be perfect for receiving packages when our gate is closed and protecting them from the elements.

Looks just like pictured. Very lightweight which makes it easy to move. Keeps things protected well. Had for a few months and have no complaints

We purchased this to store outdoor cushions but because of it's design and openings it let's field mice in ruining the cushions.

I discovered that the bottom of the box had slight damage to the tabs that clip into the side pieces. I took photos of the areas and sent to their customer service. They responded that day and offered steps to remedy the situation. Yuumi from Yita home sent a whole replacement storage box, that arrived a few days later. I took care assembling and recommend having a chair, or other object to keep the sides propped up during the initial steps. The sides are quite wobbly until you have 3 of them together. The resolution was hassle free and they were thorough with all their communications.

Used for a outdoor toy box. Been great all summer!

This is a well made, nice looking product- exactly as shown.Don’t be like me and forget to add the metal supports to the side; once the box is put together it is difficult to impossible to take apart.  Product support gave a good suggestion to separate just the top and try pushing the bars in- hard to accomplish, but worked with a small pry bar.I suspect this is not fully waterproof at the seams, but I think caulking them will be a good safeguard.

We had an issue with the lid that we didn't see till it was all put together. We notified the company and they resolved the problem nicely.

I specifically ordered a white/black storage bin to match our house. When the product arrived and we placed it where we wanted it against the white siding of the house. Turns out the unit as actually grey/black. Other than the misleading color in the description the product is great. Plenty of room for our items and very sturdy.

Very happy with this box and we have so many cushions we needed a second one.  My only complaint is it is not pest proof!!  We had to put steel wool in the bottom of the feet.  We had mice living in it within a week but that solved the problem.  Very sturdy.

We had heavy rain, and it did not get wet inside, but I don't know how well it will hold up in heavy winds.  It does wobble when when you open it.

Just put this together yesterday.  I would have liked the plastic to be a little thicker and sturdier.  You have to bang the sides into clips and be careful not to use too much force or you can crack the interlocking clips.  We got it together, it’s a two person job just because you need someone to hold the sides.  It serves the purpose for my outdoor lawn supplies and good for the money $$

I had a problem with package carriers (including a carrier that rhymes with Blamazon) blatantly leaving boxes out in the rain despite having an overhang on my patio. The last straw was my order of bamboo toilet paper getting absolutely soaked, so I ordered this. Small enough to fit on my tiny patio, keeps the rain out as long as carriers bother to use it...My complaint is in the fact that it seems to be made with a cellulose material which attracts booklice like no tomorrow. Maybe this is the case with all deck boxes now as everyone wants to be better to the environment, but I'd gladly take good old fashioned resin in order not to attract thousands of tiny white mites. Thankfully they are harmless and not destructive so it's more of a nuisance than anything, but I still brush my packages off before bringing them inside just in case.Spraying the box periodically with bifenthrin does keep them at bay but I don't know if that will eventually degrade the material. Regardless, it was a very decent price when I bought so even if I only get a year or two out of it that is fine with me. Overall it's been a great addition to my tiny patio and I'm pleased with how it's working.

i use as end table in RV looks good and can be used as storage

When it was assembled it looks nice is roomy enough and seems sturdy.

When I received the item, no reason to suspect damage as the packaging was intact. Once I started putting it together and got to the lid, I noticed that the right rear corner was cracked on the top. Since this was turned upside down until I needed to add to the assembly, I did not see until that moment. I then sent a message to the vendor explaining the problem and if they could simply send out a replacement lid. They said that wasn't an option but stated that I could return the item for a refund or full exchange, which is perfectly fine. They also offered me a solution to refund me 25% of the purchase price. Since the damage did not affect the operation or compromise the waterproof aspect, we opted for the refund credit. The refund was immediate, the response from the customer service reps with Yitahome was quick and always within 24hrs of the previous message. You learn a lot from a company on how the resolve issues and I learned in this case that I would definitely put my faith in this company for future purchases.

Not the best of quality, but decent

Ok to protect stuff, easy to put together (somewhat) and spacious. However, when I’ve opened it a few times there was water dripping from inside the lid. I think this is from condensation, but it’s quite a bit of water.  I also have a vinyl cover so it’s not like the rain is getting inside that way.  It’s ok for what I need I guess, but hope things don’t start rusting inside it. We’ll see as time goes on. Had it for several months now.

Nice product, just as described. Unfortunately, top lead came broken, but the manufacture was very helpful and responsive to send me a replacement. Well recommended!

The color is not light brown but rather a light greyish brown if you will. There's an air gap all around the top where a driven rain may get things wet, but the average rainfall kept it dry.Seems to be a well-made product. Slightly flimsier than my Suncast it's replacing but has more space and a dampened hinged top so that makes up for it. Nice fitting panels that went together quickly but dozens of screws so be prepared and follow instructions to the T.I'd like to add there are some casting imperfections such as stress marks to the plastic materials. You can choose the direction which it will face because the top will fit either way. Just fyi.

I have very limited space where I needed to put this storage box for my grilling supplies, so this box is perfect. I used a contractor bag inside just in case but it holds everything I need so my charcoal and grill scraper are not out in the damp weather.As far as putting it together. WOW. Parts didn't just snap together as suggested. It was an annoying process of getting one side clicked in, then as I was clicking in another side, it fell apart. Maybe it takes 2 people to hold one end while the other person snaps together the other but I got it done and once I did, I had a laugh because it wasn't that hard, it just required that right click. Great box. I took off one star for that assembly. Oh and at least it didn't require an Allen wrench or screws.

This is a lightweight attractive looking plastic box which will live in a nice, pest free garage to hold gardening items which are not heavy.  This is not sturdy and has rather thin plastic walls, floor, and lid. For my purpose, it is perfect and a good value for the price.  I’d spend more and get a much heavier storage container for outdoor use or to hold weightier equipment.  Delivery and condition upon arrival were great!

Item came well packaged. Assembly was a breeze took only minutes to assemble. Each piece had its letter designation molded into the plastic. Instructions very easy to follow. All in all a decent box. Only thing I wish was that the lid had a built in locking mechanism. There’s a hole to lock it or tie it shut but the lid just lays flat making it susceptible to wind blowing it open. This was a grey color I thought I’d gotten brown my error.

Deck box arrived with a damaged corner as a result of shipping - box was damaged as well. Contacted the company and they sent a new box in 2-3 days. This deck box is plenty roomy for the grandkids basketballs and looks alot nicer than what I was using ! It's also quite sturdy from what I can tell. Kudos to customer service for getting a new one out to me as quickly as they did. Assembly is pretty easy, but diagrams are confusing because sections are assembled on their side and then placed upright. I found it really helpful to just go the the last couple of pages of instructions to see the box almost completed before starting assembly. Having said that, once you figure out what to do, the entire assembly only takes about 15 minutes. Very happy with this purchase.

The lid was broken. Contacted the MFG with satisfaction.  I only gave it a 4 star rating because the instructions was not easy to follow. Overall satisfied with the sturdiness of this container. I even bought one more container.  Looks great on the deck.  We stored the outdoor umbrella and chairs for winter time.  The inside of the box remained dry during having rains.

Nice look, when complete.  Assembled easily and appears to be doing its job as we have it filled with cushion  and other patio items that need dry storage.Be sure to follow instructions regarding the metal reinforcement bars.  The only negative is the flexibility of the top when opening or closing. Although it will close properly, a larger pair of hinges may have eliminated the flex

Absolutely make sure you read the directions very carefully when assembling as there's a metal bar that must be placed in the front of the box before you assemble it. Unfortunately, because of the way it is assembled if you forget to put the metal bar in there's nothing you can do as it is a destructive process from there on. That said, it's a nice polyethylene product, good color, and should last a very long time not to mention it's easy to assemble. Certainly for me, lesson learned about reading the instructions more carefully.

It delivers what it promises. So far anyway.  Haven’t had any rain yet. Assembly is easier with two people. Done expect parts c and d to snap. Forcing it made me crack the plastic. I struggled at this first step to the point I packed it all back in the box and requested a return. I sent pic  Next day I tried again with my daughters help and we got it assembled in 10 mins. Having the extra hands to hold pieces  in place helped. Service with vendor was outstanding. I did NOT return it afterall. I kept the damaged piece. The seller offered a discount. Better than expected. I got the 30 gallon one.

This is a nice looking box. I cant speak to being waterproof because I just assembled it. Assembly is a bit tricky. The directions are not clear and the images are even harder to follow.  Lay out the pieces and have someone help.  Plan the assembly before you snap the pieces together following the letter pattern. If you make a mistake snapping a piece in it is almost  impossible to remove. The material its flimsy so it would be easy to damage the piece that snaps together.

This box will be perfect for outdoor storage. It was easy to put together. Instructions specify that you need “two or more people to assemble”  but I was totally able to do it by myself in about 10 minutes and needed no tools.

I love the way it operates. I wish the base color was a barn white- more convincing as ‘wood’- instead of taupe. Still, the design is more attractive than many at this price.Assembly would have gone faster if there was a notation which identified back and/ or front because from the illustration they were not identified  ( sides and top and bottom are made identically) and I lost time. working on the wrong side!

Interesting to assemble - few parts.  Took us about 3 hours.  Hardest part were the long sides attaching to the bottom.  Did assemble on large picnic table for all but the top.  Looks pretty sturdy.  Don’t know about weatherproofing as we assembled yesterday.  Going to add some moisture grabbers as we are on the coast of Oregon and it rains a lot.  Also going to get 2x4’s to raise as it’s going on grass.  So far 4 stars for all known.  If problems will post.PS  we are in our 80’s 😂

I needed something that fit below the top of my balcony wall and this is perfect. I was able to mostly put together by myself (I have put a LOT of furniture together). I did have to get a big burly man to come pound the last two corners together with a rubber mallet. :-) Pretty lightweight and I'm using to store things that can get wet (just in case) but it probably won't be necessary given this is So Cal. You could probably line it with a plastic sheet if you needed to. Recommend highly!

But honestly, gets the job done. Pieces snap together. Rained on mine and no leaks. Decent for the price

Quite sturdy and well designed, better quality than I expected for the price. Directions for assembly were sometimes frustrating.

Husband keeps some bbq stuff in there, nice and sturdy. Nice looking storage box.

Instructions are in Chingrish, so good luck with that.  The product was a pain to put together without someone helping you. (If you dont have someone to help you, you need to use the corner of 2 walls for help assembling some of the pieces).Once together though, the product is pretty solid and keeps things dry.

I spent a couple of hours trying to build this as directions say.  The pieces were not straight, and when you attached one side or end piece, the other one fell out.  Finally scrounged up a couple dozen screws to "tack" the pieces in place, so they couldn't fall apart while I proceeded with other pieces.  Eureka!  That did it.  It only took about 45 minutes once I found the secret.  Seems reasonably sturdy now, and spacious inside.  Support arms are nice.  But unless you're into masochism, don't try to put this together without using screws.

Looking at other reviews, I agree it isn’t too sturdy. My Ketor deck box is stronger, but this was the size I needed. Assembly isn’t hard but two things to keep in mind: 1) some of the complaints would be eliminated by being sure all the plastic clips are engaged (you can’t see the ones on the ends).  Use a rubber mallet if it doesn’t work with a fist. 2) It had the specified number of screws, but more would be nice. Step one would be better with 3 screws and it is easy to strip the flimsy plastic in later steps. I replaced a couple screws with larger ones.

I like that it’s light and waterproof

Great product! Sturdy! Waterproof!  But the directions are poor, with pictures only-- and once you snap in place, you can't unsnap!  HERE'S THE TRICK:  The "D" panel has the Letter "D" on the OUTSIDE of the box, as shown. All other letters are INSIDE  the box.  The "D" panel eventually becomes the bottom of the box that no one will see.  But I love the product, once it's put together.JR. Chicago-Bridgeport

This was rather frustrating to assemble due to it being flimsy and awkward but once assembled it’s works great.

This box serves the purpose but is a little lightweight/flimsy. I would give it 5 stars if it were made out of a little more durable or sturdy plastic

This is a great storage deck box. The instructions said to use 2 or more people to help assemble. We had one person with a Masters degree, another with a BA and another with a High School diploma and we all had difficulty following the pictures/instructions. It took over 2 hours! However, once it was finished it is the perfect item for storing cushions and other deck items. The instruction manual just needs to be a page or two longer with more WRITTEN DESCRIPTIVE steps on how to attach things. Otherwise it is sturdy, appears to be water resistant and stores a lot.

Well-made and sturdy. The several parts fit easily, but assembly was rather tedious even with rather detailed instructions. You definitely need an able assistant. If I ever get another one like this one it'll be a snap to put together! Good value for the price.

Bought this to sit beside the porch for package deliveries. Dropped a couple of concrete pavers in to weigh it down and it has been great. Fairly easy to assemble on my own. Keeps packages dry and out of sight when I'm away.

This box does what I need it to do.  It's large enough and so far weather proof.  I'm not convinced it's super strong (I wouldn't try to sit on it, but  I'm a 240 lbs guy).  And its a greyish brown plastic that's fine, but clearly a plastic box.  Overall I'm satisfied but not blown away.

We bought this to store patio furniture covers when they’re not in use. When fully assembled, the box is a little wobbly but since we don’t move it around much it does it’s job. The lid securely closes and protects the contents well. The lid also has two pistons that hold the lid up nicely when taking stuff in & out.

I love this box and my husband especially loves it. We live in a townhome and the only thing I dream of in having a bigger house is a mud room. My daughter and I ride horses (the reason we can't afford a bigger house lol!) and I come home with muddy boots. If I leave them outside the fox gets them or they get rained on. If we leave them inside we dirty up the house. This box is the perfect solution! It lives outside by our door, looks nice enough, and when we get home we just toss the dirty boots in there. So far no fox has swiped our shoes and they've stayed dry through several days of rain. It's perfect! My favorite amazon purchase of the year so far.Assembly was quick and easy. I read people's negative reviews about this and was very diligent. It definitely took some muscle to snap the parts into place and I made sure I did it right the first time because once it snaps in, it's IN. The box honestly doesn't feel heavy duty, but it's perfect for our use.

Very big and holds a lot. Easy to put together and very sturdy. Sturdy enough to hold two grown adults sitting on lid.

User error, but was a little hard to assemble (had a little difficulty telling which side to assemble based on instructions). It’s sturdy plastic and looks really nice. Seems to be waterproof so far — great storage for pillows/covers/blankets.

Overall not much to say about the product itself, quality product and easy assembly. Exactly what I expected. Unfortunately one of the side panels was cracked. I contacted the seller and with no hassle they created a case and offered to send a replacement. Overall, fast support response and with no hassle is a win. Seller also has great communication.

Bought this for our pool sweep, which fits in it way better than I could hope. Five minutes to put together. No tools.

This item was very easy to assemble, seems to be holding up well to outdoor elements.

This was so easy to assemble and it holds a lot. The deck is so much neater.

This was pretty easy to put together, I did it by myself even though at times it might have been a little easier with another person. You really just need a Philips head screwdriver and a soft mallet. I like the hydraulic lifters on both sides really secures the cover. I was able to put 3 folding outdoor chairs along with 4 full sized chair cushions in the box.

Perfect for patio storage, this stores my garden tools, fertilizers, etc. in a more stylish view and doubles as seating when we want to relax on the patio with family!

I read some of the negative reviews and all of them are from people that can't follow directions! My assembly went together very easy by myself. If you take the time to focus on directions and matching the parts, it's easy to understand. My wife did hold the top in place so I could the put screws in the hinges. Overall I'm happy with my purchase!

Perfect size exactly what I wanted

I bought this to use for aluminum cans that we crush then take to be recycled once every few months.  I was so tired of the back porch looking messy from the bag of crushed cans laying around.  That bag is now hidden in the deck box.  It took less than five minutes to put together & directions aren't needed.

My front porch is under a balcony, so when it rains, it pours on my porch. I was tired of having wet packages so I bought and assembled this box and attached a couple of signs I purchased from Amazon directing delivery drivers to place packages inside the box. It works great and was super easy to assemble. I read some mixed reviews about the ease of assembly, so I've attached the instructions. You don't need any tools and it took less than 5 minutes.

Attractive and helps w storage in my patio

I put this in my garden then added all the tools into it for easy access. The chest was fairly easy to assembly it took some pounding to get the plastics pieces to click together.  Great that its waterproof seeing that its outside.  A little light weight for my country so I put some bricks in the bottom so it wouldn't blow away.  It holds more garden stuff then I would ever need to use in my garden.  I use it all the time great buy for the price.

Easy assembly, looks nice, very sturdy.

I bought the box to store six outdoor cushions for my patio. I was amazed at how well the pieces snapped together! Great design, great engineering!

I needed it, going to order another.

Perfect

This item was easy to put together and very sturdy. The appearance is very nice and priced great.

Very happy with the product. The lid stays up which has been really nice when searching through it. The design is nice and overall sturdy. The five stars goes to their customer service department.

Easy to put together solid. Using it for packages drop off.

All parts & pieces fit perfectly with no retrofitting, drilling, sanding, etc.  This is a two-person assembly no matter who you are.  Two 63-y.o. women assembled inside on the carpet & easily carried to the back yard.A power drill made the screw part go quickly and there was no one hitch with the instructions or assembly.  The box is sturdy with hydraulic hinges that hold it open securely with closure solid and deliberate (no knock s to the head:).  I would purchase this deck box again.

Ordered 2 of the 120 gallon when they were on sale. Arrived quicker than any other item I’ve ever ordered from Amazon. Very easy to put together, folks that are saying they are difficult are wrong. My wife and I had both put together in under 45 min. Appear sturdy and well made.

A great way to store (and hide) your grilling supplies like charcoal, vortex, and chimney starter outside while keeping them dry! Also serves as corner table/plant stand on our covered patio. After being outside everyday for more than 1 year, it has survived freezing temps and blistering sun. This is a well-made product that I would definitely buy again!

This is the perfect size for our outdoor things, toys, towels, gardening, you name it! Super easy to put together and sturdy. Looks nice too.

After reading some of the reviews, I was kind of dreading the assembly of this but when it arrived, it took me about an hour to unbox it and assemble it by myself. If I was younger, I could have probably done it in half that time. It would have probably been easier to install the lid to the box if I would have had some help but if you push it back against a wall or something to support the lid while attaching the hinges, it goes on pretty good. After getting it together, it is a sturdy container and is easy to carry, even by yourself.

Very nice product that functions as storage as well as a bench. Great for a small/medium size deck/backyard. Fits my snow shovels and all my gardening gear. The upper net is a plus for quick items to grab. When I lift the hatch, a tiny bit of water enters the sides but it's no deal breaker. Price isn't bad either.

This is a beautiful Container/Chest. I had a little diffulty with instructions, not very detailed and pics for bars facing difficult to see.I did mess up and not place bars, before putting sises and was unable to take apart. Had to take of cap and saw and for bar. Didn't hurt unit tho.  Sturdy, was able to sit on. I did notice that some parts were not as flush, so still concerned about rain, especially rain that blows at an angle. I did purchase a cover for this, so this should helpI would recommend.

Easy to put together.  Sturdy.

It has plenty room for my needs. Leave it outside in elements, and no leaks. Went through winter and withstood snow on top and heavy rain. Highly recommend.

The product is exactly as advertised. Sturdy and very attractive for a dock box. I screwed up the assembly which was totally my fault and needed help. I contacted customer support, and can honestly say, it was the best customer support from any company I’ve ever dealt with. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a storage solution. I put it on my balcony and it is just perfect.

Durable and waterproof! I keep my cushions in it for my outdoor chairs. It was super quick and easy to assemble. I use as a side table as well and it works out well. Very good purchase for the price

Just the right size. Easy to assemble. Lock latch works great.

Easy to assemble.  An 80+  yo lady did it by herself in about 30 minutes.  Love the  self close lid;  storage net and divider to keep things organized.

Great lookin, good quality, and easy to assemble storage for covers, pillows, etc.

This came in a thick sturdy cardboard box so I had zero dents, dings, or issues with plastic. Was skeptical this was going to be sturdy enough for outdoor use to keep my chickens treats, worms, nesting pads, etc in. It is deep, does take 2 people & one needs to be strong enough to push & "snap" panels together. Fairly easy to put together, looks great, each panel marked A, B, etc & that was excellent! Sturdy upon completion & I am considering ordering 2 more to use at my hottub & in garden for handtools!

We used this at our RV site my Husband put it together with no problem I can say it has a lot of room in it and we Love it

It was very easy to put it together and it seems very sturdy to hold my gardening hand tools and basic supplies. May order another to put some of the smaller swimming pool  supplies in.

I don't review unless I've used an item for awhile. This storage box is large enough to hold a large tool box and a folded stroller, along with a few other miscellaneous items. It had been rained on and no water has gotten inside. It is durable even as I sit on it often. I hired someone to put assemble it because I just didn't have the time to figure it out. The handy person said it was simple and straight forward and it took only about 20 minutes to assemble. I'd buy this shed again and might even assemble it myself.

Was very satisfied with delivery time and product itself. Very easy to assemble.

We bought this to use as a toy box for our grandson  the assembly took a bit as the instructions were not in English but so far has worked very well

i recieved this product very quickly. the instructions were easily illustrated and described. this only took about 5 minutes to assemble and you can easily tell that its not falling apart. i purchased this product because im tired of my amazon packages getting wet in the rain and destroyed in inclimate weather. if anyone ever has this issue i would hands down recommend getting one of these. for the price. its outstanding!

It took my adult son an hour to put it together and clean up.  The pictures and instructions were so easy to follow.  I am 82 and his mother, so made an excellent supervisor.  I am very pleased with this product.

Hired a handy man to install it. Very spaciousp hold quite a few pillows and pads from our deck.

I will not buy from this company again. Assembled the deck box, but ended up with gap between two slats. When I forced gap closed (and this was not easy to do), another gap opened. Once assembled, you CANNOT disassemble. Looks ugly and not waterproof.  I contacted company asking for help to disassemble, told it can’t be done. Buyer beware!

Therefore when full it goes inside the tub, defeating the point of having it in which to keep things dry!

Every time I’d get the last piece connected, another side would pop open. Great product as a stress reliever cause to take it apart, it breaks resulting in me taking a rubber mallet to the entire product. Now my stress and $73 are gone. Do not by this product.

Went together no problem but no longer stays together after 1 week.  Spent over an hour trying to clip back together but does not hold.  Its a piece of junk. Do not buy!

I bought two of these. One was in great condition, the other however had a cracked lid. It’s unfortunate because they’re a little pricey, especially if it’s damaged.

While putting it together, we could not get the joints to align leaving a small gap. The overall look is wonderful but returned due to gap!

You need at least 2 people to assemble, plan on at least a flat head screwdriver to pry tab into place, so far I’m into it 45 minutes and not sure how much m going to get the lid ring snapped inI think the company that makes these needs to give it a try sometime

This product would not go together and my husband is in construction! Do not order this!!

Very difficult to assemble. Easy to hurt yourself. Best place found to sit it was the garbage can.

There is a round piece that is in the middle between the base and lid that makes it inconvenient to open and close.

It's not a terrible product,  but........when I was done with assembly, that is when I noticed a big crack in the lid. after careful inspection of the box it was shipped in, i came to the conclusion that they shipped it this way as the box was in perfect shape as was the packaging around the product. I gave the 2 stars for the easy assembly, otherwise it would get 0 for the fact that they would allow this to go out to their customers. I did not try to get a refund due to having to disassemble and get it back in the box.

First off, this is not a piece of junk. It's sturdy and looks durable. The only thing I couldn't do with it was assemble it. And that's kind of important.The directions are laughable, especially the part that mentions a few taps with a rubber mallet. Most of the pieces are curved--good luck with that mallet. The eight curved sections constitute the barrel side, and you assemble four at a time. You'll get the hang of that after a few are done. Then you have two semi-circles. Assembling one side is fairly straightforward, but then you slide the base into the slots at the bottom, and everything ends. Hours of trying to connect the final two sections were fruitless. Eventually, I utilized a pair of vise grips to squeeze the sections together, but they still would not snap into place. (If you have spare vise grips, they can live there forever...maybe) But it won't be weatherproof because  it's not connected.I plan to return this little monstrosity if I can possibly disassemble the assembled sections. If not, maybe I'll drive it over to Kohls as is and let Amazon worry about it.I know what you're thinking" "I'm handy—I can do it."That was my second mistake; the first was ordering it.

it's very hard to assemble. Also, as soon as I snap one side together, the other side loosens.  I wouldn't buy again.

The barrel design does not allow sides to stay locked when putting all sides together. There is no ring for the bottom to hold it all together like the top. Once you attempt to click the sides together, another side pops loose. Over and over and over. This means we have to shave a notch or two in order for it to seal. There has to be a design flaw in this barrel. At least ours. Right now, it is in the garage bc it is not stable. Very disappointed.

The pieces that make the sides of this don’t fit together, so you can see that the seams don’t quite a match up. This means it’s not 100% weatherproof. It was a pain to put together, and no matter how much you line up the sides, they squeeze apart. Would not recommend.

Read the reviews on this thinking ok, everyone has some issue with assembling this table.  Well turns out it does take some care when assembling, lining up the grooves at just the right ANGLE, then push to insert/lock into place.  The curves of each piece makes it a bit harder since you can't get a good steady grab of it to push into locking position.  But really, it still only took me no more than 20 minutes to put this together without using a heat/hair dryer as some recommended.  If you pay attention to angling/lining up the grooves just right and with a little pressure it snaps in.  It's sturdy considering it's all plastic material, just not sure if it would hold 300 lbs of weight if someone sat on it (I know it's not made for sitting).  In the end I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I'm keeping it though, since it's hard to find a round smaller outdoor table with storage at this point.

Comes in two side sections that have to be attached to the bottom, so can be a little tricky, but sturdy once assembled. It does the job

This product was seventy plus dollars, And was literally the hardest thing I've ever put together. And I've put together some pretty janky products previously.The pictures left out the entire section where you actually put it all togetherDefinitely would have been easier with 2 people. There may have been tears involvedBut it actually seems to be sturdy and extremely usable now that it's built.Thank you

Just what we needed but not easy to assemble. Typical, the video made it look so easy. It took two of us to assemble it.

Funny thing, the packaging was, not flat, but maybe 6" size. All the pieces that makes up the sides need to be put together. Thought it was funny. But it's up and working good. No complaints. Kinda Ikea'ish.

Like this product

Seems to be a great box but today I noticed the lid was heavier than usual. When I lifted it off and tipped it on its side quite a lot of water came out of it. I have no idea how it got in.Box contents were still dry.

I bought 2 of these YITAHOME 33 Gallon Round Deck Box, Outdoor Storage Box for Patio Furniture,Patio Table for Cushion, Pool Accessories, Waterproof Resin & Easy Assembly & Lightweight, Light Brown.I needed some rustic-looking storage bins with lids to use for storage AND for using as end tables!I picked the Light Brown color, as I figured it would be the easiest color to paint some details on later on so they will look more realistic.I had my husband assemble these, as I've had arthritis my entire life and can't use my hands very well.He assembled both of the YITAHOME 33 Gallon Round Deck Boxes with varying results.THE GOOD STUFF: - Both of the units arrived very well packaged and protected. - Both of the finished assembled Units look great and are just what I wanted. - Following the instructions  EXACTLY, the 1st Unit was pretty easy to assemble taking about 5 minutes after being unboxed. BUT, it did take some hand strength, which was why my Husband assembled these.THE NOT AS GOOD STUFF: - During assembly, it is very easy to pinch your fingers or clothing, OUCH! So be careful! - The 2nd Unit DID NOT go together as easily, BECAUSE Hubby DID NOT follow those instructions EXACTLY. - Hubby got side-tracked, then he THOUGHT he remembered how to assemble the 2nd unit! Oops! - This time, he went by the alphabetical order, (A, B, C, D) and NOT the INSTRUCTIONS order. - The INSTRUCTIONS ORDER MUST be followed EXACTLY, otherwise assembly problems WILL occur and you will have to disassemble and then reassemble. - DISASSEMBLY IS POSSABLE if done carefully. - To disassemble, you will need a flat-head screwdriver to push down on the tabs to do this! - It took Hubby around 45 minutes to disassemble and then reassemble that 2nd Unit!CONCLUSION: - The YITAHOME 33 Gallon Round Deck Box is a very nice looking, rustic style plastic storage Unit. - To save yourself a freakin' nightmare and a lot of time and frustration, follow those instructions! - AGAIN... IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY! - I totally LOVE the finished product and I would order these again!

I was looking for something to put my accent pillows in on the deck but didn’t want the traditional deck box. I stumbled on this and it seemed the only negative was really the difficulty in assembly. I am really really good at putting things together so that wasn’t enough to discourage me. I received this today and went right to work. It started off solid, I even chuckled to myself this was a piece of cake! Enter step 6…. You basically snap together each half of the barrel and then step 6 is to put the two halves together. My chuckling quickly turned into frustration. This was no joke! There is nothing except solid muscle that’s going to help you get the two halves together! Other than that assembly is easy, and the final product is worth it. I may even consider a second one! Five stars for the final product.

This was larger than I expected which is good since it can hold a lot of pool accessories.  It doubles as a table between my lounge chairs. It is not completely waterproof however so don't store anything that you don't want to get damp.It does seem to be very sturdy.  I did struggle a bit with assembly as the parts must snap together and you do need some strength.  I recommend a second pair of hands to help.  I like the look and it was a good price.

Perfect for our needs. Looks very nice, stays dry inside, and keeps our spa supplies handy. We read reviews suggesting the use of a blow dryer to warm up the connection slots during assembly and it worked like a charm! Just make sure that the tabs are all the way locked in place and it should be very secure. There were some reviews stating that the panels come apart later.  Maybe the tabs weren't inserted all the way? Anyway, we are very happy with it and if you get one, use a blow dryer.

This is a great solution for those looking for deck storage that takes up little space, but still holds quite a lot of stuff.  In my case, I was looking for a solution that would hold all the accessories of my Solo Stove Bonfire, would serve as a “stand” to place the Bonfire on when it’s not in use and wouldn’t take up much space on my deck like the excellent Solo Stove Station would.  As you can see in my pictures, the internal storage is quite generous…it can hold not only the Solo Stove Shield, carrying handle and Sticks, but has more than enough room for the Heat Deflector and Grill/Griddle tops.  Once put together, the box is quite sturdy…placing my Bonfire with its Stand on top of it, I cannot feel any stress or “give”; it’s very stable and sturdy enough to hold much more weight-wise.  The lid is very solid and has a locking-lip design, so once in place, the box is easily sealed against the elements and offers the protection against the elements you would want for something that can stay on your deck throughout the year.The only negatives would be that assembly can be tricky…make sure you follow the instructions and assemble it in a warm environment as you could easily crack the plastic tabs/fittings if you force things too much.  Also, while not expensive, it is pricey for what is ultimately a plastic container that snaps together…there are no metal fittings, the lid isn’t attached and there’s no provision to lock the lid if you want to secure the contents inside.  Having said this, there aren’t that many choices for a round-design deck box solution that offers the internal volume and dimensions this thing does.Ultimately, this is a great choice for anyone looking for a solution that’s not your typical box shape (this is round), has a lot of storage capacity without taking up too much space, is sturdy enough to place heavy objects on and can keep your stuff protected all year long.  It even looks great!

Not sure I could have got this thing put together. The tabs on the panels are supposed to snap together, but I couldn’t get them to - until I read the review about using a hair dryer. Wasn’t sure it would work, but I tried it anyway, and sure enough, with about half a minute of the hair dryer on high, the panels snapped right together. After that, I had it put together in less than 10 minutes. Love the finished product! It’s cute, sturdy, and roomier than I thought it would be. Exactly what I was looking for to add to my garden.

We use this next to our spa.  All the chemicals and diving toys fit perfectly inside.

I had a storage box which took up too much space. This works for all my patio furniture covers and served as a lovely table

I have been looking for something like this for about a year. I was looking to purchase a Keter brand storage table and this popped up. After comparing features and price, I purchased this item it arrived sooner than I expected and I am very happy with the product. It was easy to assemble and looks great.

Great place to store seat cushions! Bug candles too!

Easy to put together and holds way more items than I thought it would.

I use it for storing pellets for my pellet grill!

Lovely looking piece of garden furniture. Easy to assemble and so far has kept the rain out. Plenty of room to store things and is sturdy enough to use as a sear if needed.

Love the round storage but goodness me it was the most fiddliest thing I've ever put together and I've done some tough jobs.It takes a pair of big hands and a whole lot of manipulation to slot the pieces into each other, 5 interlinking slots along each edge, whilst one end goes in the other end pops out, turning them this way and that way just to get some kind of grip and the right angle to get the slippery pieces linked up.The ring at the bottom that holds the whole thing together at the end was the most difficult, almost as if it were too small.I had to wedge the whole thing up tight against the sofa with my feet up against it but whichever part I managed to attach another part would always pop off.I had to bang the ring down with my fist around it's circumference but it would still pop off somewhere else. I ended up sitting on the edge of the ring while pulling the body inwards to fit. I honestly thought I'd have to call someone in to hold it down for me.I bought two of these. The first one took me over half an hour to put together and the second took me twenty minutes and went smoother from practising on the first one. Nevertheless I have a very sore fist and I feel like the factory workers got out of doing the hardest part.Overall its good quality and very spacious inside, looks like it will hold over half of the contents of a rectangular trunk. It's really big, doesn't appear so because of the angle of the camera but it's almost double the size of the seat of the blue chair.Make sure you follow the instructions because if you go wrong it will be difficult if not impossible to unslot the parts without breaking them. Also don't panic when you see repeat letters for each of the pieces. There are A, B, C, D wrapped together, and then the same again wrapped separately. You have to put the four pieces together and repeat. Then you join the two halves together. That's the most awkward part along with the ring.

Looks brilliant in the garden and an aesthetic way to store toys. Easy and quick to set up, great value for the money and love that it looks different to the usual storage boxes

Bought to put furniture covers in when not in use.Comfortably big enough and doubles as a table, just what I wanted.Description accurate.

Plastic has the consistency of a kids play toy not an outside shed.  I can’t see this lasting more than a couple of years.  The first shed arrived with a broken panel where the hinge attaches.  Customer service couldn’t help me so Amazon sent me a replacement for the parts.  I do not believe they actually answer the calls from the number provided but did respond to email.  Now I have to haul two giant boxes back to UPS.  It would have been nice if they could have shipped the part.  I would not order this again and would probably exchange it if it wasn’t such a pain to disassemble and repackage.

I have purchased two of these of these storage containers to hide our garbage bins.Would not recommend, save your time and money for something else. Everything is crooked and nothing lines up. Seller said it’s a one time issue on the first I resealed but after ordering a second one I really doubt it since they are both like that. Too much hassle to return. Not happy with it.

The two side pieces do not fit into the bottom. It looks like it should fit but neither side fits. I have put together many outdoor storage bins and this is the first one that does not fit. Please advise.

Not sturdy in the slightest, I expected some wobble cause it's cheap plastic but this is crazy, the door gets out of level every time you open it so you need to fenangle it. Was also a pain to install cause the grooves we're aligned neatly for the sides, so basically had to mallet them in and dent up the corners a little. Do not recommend.

Missing the top and bottom and guessing screws or something to connect the pieces. Will be demanding a refund

Could not assemble this item without fist having to grind it to fit. Otherwise, it just could not be assembled.It must have been faulty in how the casting was done. The holes just did not line up.

Wind blew top off, hinges broke. Company contacted and they were no help at all. I just wanted 2 replacement hinges which I was willing to pay for but they don't have replacement parts.

Don’t waste your money.  Made with very cheap plastic. Could not even get the first two pieces together. Tried reaching out to the vendor, but the vendor never responded.

This shed was delivered.It is INCOMPLETE:Missing partsAB2(×12)7(×1)8(×1)9(×1)10(×18)12(×12+2 extra)NO ROOF,FLOOR,ONLY 1 BAG OF  11(×24+4 extra)CANNOT USE.LAST OF THE NICE DAYS TO GET DONE BEFORE SNOW FLIES SO I CAN MOVE STUF TO SHED AND PARK 2 CARS IN GARAGE.THIS SUCKS.NO ONE ANSWERING THE PHONE,RINGS 2×,then nothingPLEASE RESPOND WITH REST OF MY SHED ASAP!

Plastic pieces are very cheap. The unit uses metal and plastic screws to attach the various pieces together and the plastic screws are very soft. Some of the metal screws will spin in place, as you might expect when screwing metal into soft plastic.2 seams in the plastic back were not sealed properly.One of the pieces did not have the predrilled holes for the intended screws.Please see photos.

Panels did not line up when I attempted to assemble it then when I lifted the bottom to check alignment the bottom feet that hold the whole thing together snapped off making it useless. Waste of money made out of cheap materials.

I’ve built a couple of these storage sheds from different brands and this one take the prize as the WORST design. Gaps everywhere and the plastic shifts even though it’s secured on the base board. STAY AWAY. Also the measurements are not accurate, my trash bins did not fit inside.

Ordered/received this item in April of 2023. Thought I was ordering an OUTDOOR storage box but after less than 3 months the lid to this box has warped at the corners allowing rain to blow in and access for rodents.Wish I had listened to a similar review about warpage.

Incomplete order delivery. Additionally it was delayed twice. Manufacturer is not to be trusted.

This was very easy to assemble but unfortunately it is poor quality.  Within a week it was warped from the sun so badly that the top will not close properly anymore.  And we aren’t even in the summer Florida heatwave yet. So sad since it looked so nice in the pictures and was the size I needed.  Very disappointed.

This is just cheap plastic formed. The bottom is cracked along with the side pieces definitely not worth 299.00 I paid. The website for product support sends you to some website thats not even the same company. The email address that was provided in the packaging is to a hotmail sent an email but no response as of yet.Dont waste your money.

Only received two side of it all returned

I was very excited to get organized, so I went out on a limb and ordered this shed.The quality looks good. But it arrived without two very important parts, the top and bottom.Fingers crossed that the company makes this an easy fix.

Paid Full Price but only recieved The top Two pieces of the entire Storage Shed.Please ship the rest of the package before I persue this as a scam.

The package arrived incomplete.  The package was picked up by UPS.  I have the receipt.  My account has not been credited.

Cannot assemble. Pieces are warped and don’t fit into each other. Horrible, horrible design.

Item arrived without the floor and cover pieces.

Did not like this product. Flimsy, it did not include the correct parts

The reason I’m disappointed with this product is the poor manufacturing. The main issue I have is that the side panels do not line up correctly/completely with the back panels (see photos). I followed the instructions and slid both the side and back panels over in the bottom slots as far as they would go, but the panels do not fit together at the bottom on either left or right sides. On the left side of the unit the side panel is too far over on the back panel so the screw holes don’t line up. On the right side of the unit the side panel is too far away from the back panel so the screw holes don’t line up. I could only connect the back and side panels together at the top three spots but not the bottom three spots (with the lousy plastic screws provided), which makes the unit much less sturdy. It’s difficult to tell exactly what’s causing this—if it’s a problem with the slot placement on the bottom piece or if it’s something to do with the back and side panels. Regardless, the pieces simply do not fit together as they should.The other issue I had was that the screw holes were too small on the hinges that connect the front and top doors. I had to re-drill the holes on all hinges to get the screws to fit.For what I paid for this unit I expected much better quality.

Very poor quality especially for the price. The door latch doesn't latch at all, very flimsy, the hood arm isn't hydrolic at all, any pressure from the inside, against the doors and they will come right open. I wouldn't recommend at all.

This went together ok with my wife helping. It looked good at first, but after a few days in the Arizona sun... not so much. I think it's a good product for a cooler climate.

I had this storage shed for little over 3 months now.  Assembly was not that easy, few of the parts did not fit easily and had to force to fit in to a point of breaking.  The top lid is now warping and won't close tightly and spiders and other bugs are getting in.  I don't recommend buying this product.

The arm that props the lid open was already installed upon arrival with the sharp end of one of the screws coming through the top of the lid which is on the exterior and visible.

After assembling there is a problem with the latch that holds the right front door in place.  After lifting the lid the front doors completely fall open.  You have to wrestle the box to get it closed back up.  Not worth the effort......

Not easy to build it was very difficult to fit together the doors don't work the best

In the description bikes are listed as an item you can store in the unit. Maybe small kids bikes would fit, but not our 26” adult bikes. Would have sent it back but it’s already assembled. Very disappointing.

The parts did not fit together easily. After two attempts we finally got the box together.

Although it is a great price, the item I received was defective. We were unable to put together due no drilling of the plastic side. The company offered me 25 dollars for something we can't use.

When I put the item together the rod that is supposed to hold the lid up stops it from closing all the way and when you try to open the lid it keeps it from staying open. It's a problem with the engineering. Also if you look at the measurements and do the math of the capacity meaning the inside, the actual cubic feet is: 27.49 cubic feet. So it's advertised falsely. When I tried to call the company from the number that Amazon presents for customer service for this item, a company picked up that said they have nothing to do with the company that sold me this item.

Was gonna use it for mower and other yard stuff now it's pretty much a play house for the grand kid to small for anything else

The fit was terrible. the instructions were vague at best ,the pieces didnt fit right. need 2 people to build . would NEVER recommend.!!!!

Product was as expected, but did fit together correctly. Customer service was vey good my purchase price was completely refunded

The media could not be loaded.
                



Product came crack, it look like it happen during manufacturing

Fine product and easy to assemble. One of the photos shows a shelf. It does not include a shelf.

Easy-ish set up with 2 people.  Not light -takes 2 to move. Once moved into place and filled after a couple of weeks it separated and cover wouldn't sit into place. Door lock never really engaged.  I would pass on this product.

This box is not designed with 100 degree Texas temps.  Lid warped after 3 days in the sun.  Had to put bricks on the corners to try and prevent further warping.  There's no internal shelves.  Should have gotten those. Hard to put together alone. Not very sturdy.  Don't buy this.

I think the shed is great. I bought it to keep my pool equipment out of the weather.  The problem is that the hinges are plastic and the wind flipped the roof and broke the hinges.  I tried to find a way to order replacement hinges, the AI said to go to the hardware store to find replacements. LOL, the hinges are cheaply made for this and you could never find a replacement.  I guess I will McGiver something.  You would think they would have replacements available to order for such a design flaw. Only buy if it will be placed out of the weather.

If you're looking to add any shelves for this unit, good luck. The company doesn't sell any despite there being clear grooves & screw holes and grooves for four shelves. It isn't really an option to customize wood planks because the shed is plastic and isn't sturdy enough to hold shelves without screws for the build in screw holes. They don't even give information on where you can get a shelf.This product is only worth it if you do not need a single shelf.

I was a but skeptical at first when I ordered this shed but when it arrived and started putting it together, I was very pleased with the end result - sturdy, nice looking, and easy to assemble storage shed with plenty of space for my needs.

We live in a rural, mountain town and have had all kinds of issues with our package deliveries. Our mailmen have left packages in all kinds of different places other than what one would think was the most obvious and easiest option: our front porch. Sometimes it's on the small retaining wall right across from the front porch (note said they couldn't figure out how to get to the porch...well how about you follow the obvious path, or just hop down the 2 feet from where you left the package and walk across to the porch...and then follow the path back to your truck?); and once, they literally opened the back door of a car in our driveway and put it in the backseat.  Not kidding. Image if that was a visiting friends' car!Our biggest battle was in getting them to stop leaving it directly against the basement French doors where 1) our son can't open to the doors to retrieve said packages, 2) it gets rained on due to no roof under the deck boards above it, and 3) time and time again isn't where we've asked them to put it!So in talking to our mail lady, she said to get a box and put it at our mailbox like other people do. Well, our mailbox is not in front of our rural homestead and we get a lot of larger shipments that require a huge box. Our mailbox is up the road on another road next to 3 other mailboxes and we don't want our packages up there where no one can see what's going on (no neighbors up there). So we decided to purchase this small "shed" and put signs on it (and in our mailbox) for oversized deliveries. So far, it's been a 75/25 delivery success in this box.  It's nice looking and easy for us and our delivery drivers to access.  It holds our largest packages and smaller ones. Very pleased with the purchase.

After completing a garage floor epoxy project, I needed an outdoor storage shed to house some of my heavier tools and miscellaneous stuff that I no longer wanted to clutter the garage. I researched the available sheds (Rubbermaid, Suncast, Yitahome among others) and decided to get the Suncast. Unfortunately, Suncast does not ship to California. Ultimately, the Yitahome 27 cu ft shed fit my needs best so I placed the order with Amazon using a $20 off coupon.Number 1: You will likely receive two (2) separate deliveries, one with the sides and back panels as well as the hardware needed for assembly and the second package with the top and bottom sections. Both cartons had some tears and possible re-taping (jpg) but everything was A-OK and all of the pieces were included.Number 2: The instruction booklet and all of the hardware came in a single larger zip lock bag that was included with the side and back panels. The various screws, hinges and brackets were in separate smaller bags. Every single item was included and Yitahome provided some extra screws "just in case" (they actually list the numbers of each part to be used and note there are extras in some cases (example: 18 + 1 extra, 12 + 2 extra); very thoughtful service.Number 3: I did encounter some issues during assembly -  all of the panels are well marked and identified in the manual.  Unfortunately, one of the pieces (the left side panel),  would not slide into position no matter how hard I tried to get it to fit (jpgs).  I contacted Yitahome and Amazon on Monday, May 29, Memorial Day, and didn't expect a reply for days. However, Amazon did reach out promptly and offered to send new side panels. By that time, I had tilted the partially completed structure on its side and with the help of gravity, I guess, the left side panel slid into place. In all likelihood the panel needed to be lifted and slid in one motion (not shown in the manual or seen on the instruction video). So, having two people might make the assembly easier.Number 4: After that it was pretty straight forward. I'll reiterate, the instructions are well laid out with good illustrations and, with each part of the process, the manual shows you exactly which pieces are needed. Quite well done I must admit. There were a couple of issues of minor consequence: 1) there were no starter holes for the small metal piece that receives the metal roof arm support (jpg). I rectified this by applying firm pressure using an awl to create screw holes. 2) there was a film of resin (jpg) where a hinge was to be placed. Again, the awl allowed me to clear the obstruction and the hinge slid easily into place.Overall, the shed was easily assembled after fiddling with the reluctant left side panel and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a modest sized outdoor storage shed. If not for the issue with the side panel I would have given this 5 stars. Also, it has not been put through any sort of stress - weather is ideal today and it has only been in service for a few hours. I will update the review if there are changes but we won't get a serious rainfall for many months and the temperatures are seldom over 75ºF. Good luck with your purchase, whichever shed you choose. I do recommend the Yitamhome 27 cu ft outdoor shed.

Only problem was, it was 1” to narrow. A quick trip to Harbor freight and buy 2 wheels 3/4"narrower each. Now it's stored by the house I just roll it out and plug it in.

Very easy to put together. Looks fantastic. I used mine for a generator shed and it worked great.

This storage shed is made from high quality, heavy duty material. It's extremely well thought out design is cut and formed for easy assembly. And the English instruction booklet is a synch to follow. With the exception of the lid top cover, which benefits from a two-person effort, construction can be accomplished by one person--no problem. Note that it might be beneficial to attach hinges, door handles, etc. before final assembly. Big plus are the pre drilled guide holes for the screws. Good value for thr price!

First off it did come well packaged, came in two separate packages. Took my husband about an hour to put together and it was a two person job because I had to hold the lid up while he put the latches on(the lid was very heavy). And for some reason, one of the front doors is light gray, and the rest of it is a dark gray as seen in the picture.  It holds our city garbage cans nicely and overall it looks nice and neat outside.

Decent to assemble and works for grill tool storage, my intended use. However, the hinges are not "rotatable", do not fully open as shown in the detail photo of the advertisement. For the walk space I have available, means I have to close the doors to walk past. Not a deal breaker but not expected.

Not quite as big as I expected based on photos. Fairly easy to assemble.

Pieces don't really fit but it do

A regular padlock will not fit.  Otherwise it is very nice.

I’m pleased with the little shed. I’m 80 years old and had no problem assembling most of it by myself, just needed a little help with the hinges, someone to hold the doors and lid in place while I put in the screws. Directions easy to follow. Holds a lot. I bought it to store the g grandkids out door toys, it’s big enough that the 4 year old likes to use it as a fort.  Would definately buy it again.

Product took me about an hour on my own to assemble. It's light weight and easy to move around. Fits my lawnmower, gas can, shovel, rake and some other small outdoor items. The only issue I had were the pieces sliding in. It seemed the sides just wouldnt slide back as far as they should. Used a hammer ☹️ to kind of put them in place which I wish I didn't have too. I suggest that as you put the sides and back together to screw in the bolts as you go.

Easy to put together except for the top when another set of hands would have been helpful. Trash cans just fit and able to lock it so the raccoons can not get into it.

Need 2 people to assemble. Bring your own small Phillips screw drive as the one included in the assembly kit will strip out as it is not a hardened steel. Took about 1 hour to assemble. I have this out at my property locking up some tools. hopefully it lasts many years.

Nice shed, ample storage for outdoor cushions.  Had an issue with high winds flinging open the lid and breaking the hinges.  Contacted the vendor and they shipped me replacement hinges.  Good customer service!

I really like how it looks but I don’t like that when I raise the lid, It isn’t as user friendly as another one we have.

Great storage for the camper. Initially bought it to store trash cans outside to free up space in the garage to do winter projects, but after assembling the two trash cans did not fit. I had to install latch locks on the side doors to keep the door from coming open. For the lid the latch is way to small to place a lock on it. This product is great for our permanent campsite after I modified it for a little extra security.

I needed my lawnmower out of my garage to free up some space, so I took a chance with this.  It serves its purpose.  It is waterproof. At least so far.  We’ve had a couple of decent rain storms and it kept my mower dry.  It doesn’t replace a full size shed, but for the price and ease of putting it together, I’m happy with it.

One side was very hard to snap in. Otherwise looks good

We use this to house our generator  and it truly does what it's supposed to do. Easy to put together.  The only reason we gave it 4 stars is the overall measurement is out side not inside. Be aware of that. Our generator almost didn't fit.

I bought this for my garbage and recycling. Nice design. Seems to keep things dry. We get high winds where I live, so I had to anchor it to a wall.

Lawnmower

In general the product is good. It would help if the merchant specifies product comes in two different boxes. That's confusing. Product support and client service is very good. Recommendable for outside storage.

I used this to store a camping generator. It does the job and looks ok. There was some damage at corners that happened somewhere in shipping. Assembly requires some mallet work, carefully to avoid damage to plastic. Only a very small lock can be used due to the design. I used a cable lock for lockers. This is fine if security isn't a big deal.

Took about an hour and some change to put together and is a good size for what I need at the moment. Like this storage space overall

Easy to assemble

love this storage unit but would like to get shelves for it can u help me

Over all good product, however, through shipping a few pcs were cracked and the item is just too big to return, maybe better packaging would help.

Easy set up. Looks nice in yard and keeps all of those chairs out of our basement.

I'm semi retired and my wife and I enjoy being outside on our patio. This box is the perfect size (and waterproof) for storing our outdoor tv with it's lift. It was very easy to assemble. Just note, they don't tell you, but the delivery comes in 2 boxes, one delivered (the one with the tracking number) on one day and the 2nd one came about 3 days later.UPDATE : It's been on my patio for about a month now. It's been though at least 3 pretty windy, heavy rain storms. The box held up well and the contents stayed dry. We love it!

I like that (following included instructions) it was easy to assemble. I like that the finished product easily contains my trash and recycling containers and looks good. In my judgement it is substantial enough to deal with our New England winters.

It fit my two 64 gal trash totes perfectly. The color compliments my gray house. Very pleased. Just note the item came in 2 separate boxes, delivered 3 days apart. They had 2 separate tracking numbers.

I just put this box together and it was effortless. People are saying it's thin, I don't find that at all. It's sturdy and good looking. When you put it together spray all the slots on the floor with silicone spray and it will slide together a lot easier. This box is every bit is good as the name brands. I've had them all. Also as you put each panel up screw it in and then move to the next panel it works a lot better that way

Perfect size for 2 large trash cans

The instructions on this were great.  Strong design.  I bought one similar about four years ago and this is really a step up on design.  I live in Florida and it sits in weather.  Sun wind rain.  Very pleased with assembly.  I am the guy who had an extra wheel putting together a bicycle!  Make sure the size you are ordering

We bought this for my husband's new 2024 GMC Sierra.  The trash can is large, but fits nicely between the seat and the dashboard.

This storage box works. Assembly was ok, mower fits in only if the handle is collapsed. This would have been the cheapest mover box I could find and I am pleased with it.

I honestly have no complaints and am pleasantly surprised that it has held up this well.  Read reviews about the installation as there is one gotcha that will damage the unit a little if not careful.

Sturdy can open doors as well as top makes for a great cover for well pump and makes it easy to access

We had a significant issue that was not the fault of the company, but which was expediently addressed by their customer service team. I would never hesitate to purchase other items from this company. They Extremely responsive to their customers needs and want them to be more than satisfied with their high quality product.

Item came in 2 boxes.  Parts were easily identified & was very easy to put together.  Project was completed in less than an hour,  unlike those metal shed kits that have a million pieces and can take days of headache to complete. Very happy with this purchase.

It was easy to put together and very sturdy.  The quality of material was high quality.

The size on a small patio is great. I bought 2 precut boards and made very nice shelves for 1/2 the price of the shelves offered for purchase.

I liked the sturdiness of this product.  It is made to last a while which is important since it is subject to the weather.  The instructions were somewhat complicated especially which type of screw to use.  Identifying each piece was good.

The product itself had some issues being put together, but the customer service team was very attentive. It was refreshing to actually get prompt responses from folks that seemed to actually care. Thanks for the quick attention to our questions!

Simple to put together but it was better with two people.  No problem getting the sides in place.  We did put anchors in as afraid it would move in the big winds. Perfect for extra storage needs

I had a problem with 2 pieces.  Amazon wanted me to return the entire product which I had already spent an hour putting together.  After being frustrated with Amazon, I tried the product customer service and they immediately assured me they would help and within a day shipped me the broken pieces.  So thankful.

Product is durable and easy to install.Had a minor problem, had heavy heavy winds and one of my hinges bent. I reached out to yita homes via email because my warranty was up and they replaced everything for me.

This storage shed is a good buy.  We had to put it together which went well. It's pretty big too.

Was impressed at how fast went together with very limited tools.  The design is well done so is very stable when complete.  Extremely happy with it.  Made the mistake of ordering another box and had to return as literally had 100s of pieces inside the box and an encyclopedia sized steps manifesto.  Yikes!

Love it. Ordered another, this time with a shelf. Price had gone up in 2 weeks time, not happy about that, but really loved the unit.

This was a great find!! I love it!! It was easy to assemble and looks terrific.

Great product to have on our porch to hide our garbage cans, instead of in our garage!

The product is sturdy, high quality, easy to assemble.  Had an issue with hinges which are plastic, important to secure shed locks on windy days.  Customer service was very professional and resolved my issues promptly!  Great product, great buying experience

Sturdy construction, easy assembly. Perfect for my overflow of garden stuff. Definitely recomend.

It does not come with shelves, and though it says they can be ordered, they give no information on how to order a shelf.  The Yitahome company is very difficult to reach.  Leave a number, and they call you one time out of six, and I was not home to get that one call.  Still waiting. Amazon did not answer question:  "Does Amazon stock the shelves?"  The contact number for Yitahome got me a company that said they were no longer associated with Yitahome, and they gave me a number for Yitahome, and that has not gotten any results yet.

Easy to assemble, all connections lined up perfectly and pieces slide into place with little effort. I would buy again.

Arrived as promised. Very easy to assemble (one person) because directions were concise. Sturdy and the right size for my needs.

Now my garbage cans are not an eyesore

Great value and easy to assemble

Cute shed. Put it together myself. Very spacious. Definitely would recommend buying this product.

I bought this shed to put my lawn mower and other garden tools in up against my Tuff Shed. It was so easy to assemble with the great instructions provided. The material that it is made of is so sturdy and attractive. I bought the green one and I love the color. This is really a great purchase.

Worked out great for our lawn mower. And couple bags of potting soil

Easy to put together and great customer service

I ordered 2 of these boxes and they were easy to assemble with good directions. Shortly after putting them in place and using them there was a big storm. I had not put anything on the lid latch and the wind pulled open the lids breaking the hinges. The vendor was great and sent me replacement hinges and the lids are back on and this time solidly latched

The bin was easy to put together and all parts fit perfectly.  They also include extra fasteners of each size in case you misplace some.  It is sturdy and looks great.  I would compare it to those costing twice as much.

The hinges for the lid broke within the week. Save your money. Looked nice but CHEAP hinges. Look elsewhere.

Experienced Amazon shopper:  This is a waste of money. This brand is low end and the plastic is not durable American plastic. It is not like Lego Blocks. This is flimsy, fragile, bad plastic material. Amazon should not represent this product and you as the consumer should not get scammed.

Reading reviews easy to assemble.THINK NOT! Everytime I get one side in and try to put the other side in the first side comes out.Did this for about an hour.If you live alone not a good product for you to get. Now have to pay someone to put it together.

I received a used one. The edges were bent. Hard to put together and to take apart.

When I got this several months ago, I thought it was exactly what I was looking for - a storage box that was small enough to fit into the limited space I had available, but big enough to hold my gardening supplies and a bit extra.For the gardening supplies live shovels etc? Works great.If you're planning on storing bird seed or really any kind of seeds? Look elsewhere. Critters chewed through the lid of the box (!!!) to get at the bird seed and send it everywhere. I wasn't until I put the seeds in a regular plastic container, within this storage box, that I stopped losing seed.One would think this box would be tougher than a standard plastic storage tub, but not so much.

I originally thought I had been sent an incorrect D panel due to the way the instruction manual is designed and just how different that panel looks to the rest of the box. The D panel feels a lot more flimsy, doesn't have the rattan look, and has different connectors than the other panels. Turns out, it's the bottom panel, and the giant, ugly D embossing  goes inside of the box. Once I figured that out the box went together pretty easily. Hopefully the box holds up, but the thinness of the bottom panel has me a bit concerned, so that and the manual are why I'm giving this three stars. The rest of it seems pretty sturdy and it's a good size. I'd already sent the company an email thinking I'd gotten the wrong back panel piece, so I sent a follow up and am adjusting my review here as well.

Overall a nice container with lid for my outdoor patio chair cushions, but the design is defective with regards to the holes for a lock. No standard lock will fit because the lid has an overhang above the lock hole that prevents the shackle, even cable-based ones, from fitting thru the hole.

The lid is not square. Can't figure out why. This really annoys me. Means the thing can't function as a seat without always being careful to make sure the lid is seated properly.

Easy to put together, a wee bit flimsy. Put brick inside, during wind it will blow away

The top doesn’t sit square on the sides. Otherwise, it does keep 4 outdoor cushions dry when storing.

Needed something on the porch to store our solar lights for the winter. This is perfect! Requires assembly which I did myself in 10 minutes, very easy to do. It is light enough to move around but sturdy also. It holds all my lights plus extra room. The texture of the plastic gives it a little more appeal than a basic storage bin. Works perfect to sit my porch seasonal decor on as well.

Looks elegant and expensive. Comes with great instructions so it is very easy to put together. Fits a lot of stuff . Lightweight so it's easy to move around but at the same time it is sturdy and not flimsy at all. Very happy with my purchase

I tend to read the bad reviews on an item first so I was a bit reluctant to purchase this but the price was right.  I'm not sure what happened with the people who rated it so poorly but I found it to be easy to assemble, sturdy, and waterproof.

Nice and sturdy

You definitely do have to bang this around a bit with your fists to put it together but it falls right into place & latches together great.Great perfect & perfect size for what I needed. I’m using it to hide my recycling on my deck & I have room to even add 2 of my deck pillows for my outdoor furniture. This will be great for storage in the winter!

I bought this for my patio to put my pool towels to keep them from getting dusty and dirty and it was perfect! It sits at the end of our patio loveseats like a side table and blends in well. It's super sturdy that a lighter person can sit on it like another seat even. It holds over 10 towels and has kept them clean and dry from all the elements. So pleased!

This is exactly what I needed! It was very easy to assemble. I am using it for extra storage on my camper.I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy again!

I was looking for something to store the decorative pillows on my porch when not in use. This is the perfect solution and a nice seat, too.

I use this to store all of my Blackstone accessories it does a great job and keep some nice and clean

It interweaved pieced of plastics that kind of goes other multiple ways but not fully. You will need to give it hard smacks while having 4 hands to get past a couple stages of assembly.

I am not putting this together yet as the instructions say you cannot take it apart once it's snapped together. This is made of solid plastic and light weight. No shoddy edges, well designed but..a higher price than I would buy it for, plus it's a plus that it fits together so well and a minus at the same time. My reason for a deduction of a star is price and inability to disassemble.

Bought this for Amazon packages that are delivered to our door. It is plenty roomy for us. It was a teeny tricky to get together but once it’s together it seems quite strong. The lid opens and closes easily. We like the dark gray color. It can work as an extra seat or even a little table between 2 chairs. I believe this will hold up for quite a long time. I am not sure about the sun fading the color as we haven’t had it long enough to know but ours is under a porch roof anyway. It is not waterproof- just fyi- which is not a problem for us. I’m happy with this purchase and recommend this outdoor storage box.

Since I have a long driveway, I leave a box near the road for packages. For years I just used a lidded tub, but over time it became brittle. This not only was easy to put together, but it has kept the packages dry, I added a sign on top for package companies and I know most things will fit inside. I am very happy with this purchase and hope it will last long since water doesn't sit on the cover attracting wildlife to drink and chew.

It's working great for storage outside to protect my grandsons sport balls

I was confused about how to put this together, but finally figured it out by looking at online pictures. I LOVE this box for package deliveries! There are a lot of porch thefts in my neighborhood. I put this box on the porch, along with a sign on top that says "leave packages in the box" (the delivery guys would leave them on top before). This worked like a charm, now everything goes inside the box, I get a notification from my Ring app, and can pick it up as soon as possible. Sturdy, waterproof plastic, good buy.

It stores our 4 thick cushions perfectly and keeps the water and sun out.

Very reasonably priced, so I bought it thinking it wouldn't last till next summer, but honestly I was wrong. It is very sturdy. I have sat on it. My son has climbed on it and it hold up very well. Bought it to keep pool toys in and it is perfect. Doesn't hold water, so the toys could drain. I am very happy with my purchase.

Bought this to replace a similar container that was 6 years old and began to fall apart (by a different vendor).Relatively easy to assemble [having put others together].  Once together, was stable and easy to use.Been outside for over three weeks and houses bird feed and tools.  Had no leaks during several heavy rains.Also, using a simple wire to lock the top - has proven to been squirrel proof as well - older container had a corner eventually opened by squirrels biting at it.

Love it! Exactly what it looks like in the picture. Good quality.  I'm using it outside and it works perfect. You can even put a lock on it if u want too. Highly recommend this product! Happy customer! I would order this again and might.

I wanted one of these to store our American Flag. Loved it so much got another one for my Amazon packages. It seals nice so my dog doesn't get in it and the rain doeant get in. Rain does sit on the top of it. But not a big deal if it doesn't get inside.

Nice looking box built out of sturdy materialDoesn't leak so that's a plusEasy to just pop together and set it out

True 32 gallon storage unlike the big box brands that measure the exterior size, and for much cheaper. Quality seems to be great and similar to higher priced options. I will update if issues arise.

Our packages stay nice and dry in this container we use for parcel drop-offs.

I use it to store 5 chair covers and I chase cover. I still have room for a couple more if I need it.

Exactly as the description. Easy to put together and exactly what I was looking for.

Bought to store blankets in on front porch...love it

We use this to hold several patio furniture covers.  It is really easy to put together - less than 5 minutes.  It  easily fits 4 covers from our loveseats as well as our TV cover.  You can also sit on it if you want as it's very sturdy.

So easy to put together! Everything snaps into place. No nuts, bolts, allen wrenches, etc. They suggest a mallet, nope did not use it!I paid more for the crappy tables from Menards, then this one.Just ordered a second one!May get one for my daughter!

So far so good. It has rained quite a bit, and no water has gotten in. Great storage capacity. It looks really nice on the porch.

Not large enough for the stuff needed to store

Looks great with my other outdoor furniture and does what I need it to do.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.

Use this on front porch to keep our muddy boots in so the dog doesn't drag them off! Looks great and works perfect.

We use this to store my daughters toys outside. It is definitely water proof. Size is prefect for all her toys. It only took 20 min to put together.

Great storage bin for chair cover, bird seed storage outside or whatever you want to keep dry.

This was very easy to snap together and foots perfectly on my patio.  Very sturdy also.

This is easy to assemble, no tools needed just snap into place.  It is great to use as an extra seat and also store things inside it.

I like that it's Lockable and I use it for Storage.

We use this to store patio chair cushions and as a side table for placing dinner items when eating outside. Perfect for all those purposes. It was also very easy to assemble.

Buying another one.

Works perfectly to store my furniture cushions. Directions for assembly were easy to follow.

I’m using this as storage on my boat. Keeps everything nice and dry.

Easy to set up and they look nice. Waterproof and the color doesn’t fade away.

Easy to assemble; great size for a smaller condo patio. Easily holds soil,hose,and some gardening tools.

Storage for charcoal, torch fluid, fish food, cushions, etc.

Easy to assemble and perfect for what I needed it for.

Looks good for the price. Easy to assemble. Only time will tell if it holds up.

Easy to put together after we figured it out.

Very waterproof and looks great

Great little storage box.  Easy to assemble too!

This is a good size outdoor box that not only looks nice with the rattan design but is very useful too. It has plenty of storage space, we currently have my sons' soccer balls and other various accumulated outdoor sports equipment in it. I was surprised at how much fit, but it holds a good amount. It is also very nice to use as a side table to our glider. Many uses for this box. The assembly was easy.

Our old box started leaking and the pool towels were soaked and moldy so spent a lot of time looking for a new deck box. Wanted one smaller than old box and finally settled on this one. It is very flimsy and two  days after setting it outside we had a heavy rain/hail storm causing the lid to fly open and soaking the towels again. There is a small spot to latch it closed provided you can find something small enough to fit through the tiny holes and your fingers are small enough to work it open once in place. The only thing we had was the smallest lock made (like for a suitcase which fits through the end of the zipper). Terrible design and don’t expect it to hold up long. Would like to return it but that’s difficult once put together and the box it came in was destroyed. Gave it one star because it looks nice.

This is the cheapest piece of garbage ever. It’s all plastic pieces that are supposed to snap together but are a nightmare to get in place. The pieces are misshaped and warped. I can’t get the lid pieces to fit together they are so out of shape. No way is this flimsy plastic box sturdy enough for the uses indicated. There are also visible gaps which water and bugs will certainly get in. Not waterproof. Don’t waste your time or money on this garbage. I will be returning.

Great price but you receive what you pay for. Every piece of plastic was shattered. Highly do not recommend.

We followed the diagrams given to the best of our ability. After getting four or five of the  panels attached we realized that we had done it wrong and we can’t undo it to fix it. The plastic split. We just want a refund. We cannot take it apart to send it back to you.

Broke in multiple places not even a day of use! It’s made out of cheap flimsy plastic.

Very flimsy,  not waterproof,  would not recommend

Color is really nice, goes well with outdoor decor and quite spacious. It holds all the pillows and outdoor blankets. Great quality, keeps items dry and easy to open.

This is a nice size, we purchased it to store our outdoor cushions.  It's easy to put together,  durable,  and good closure. Only reason for 4 stars is that when it arrived one of the corners was broken in shipping.  Because we needed it at that time and there wasn't time to replace it, we glued it and we are using it.

Easy to assemble and good quality. Fortunately it has a place for a padlock. We weren’t trying to prevent theft but the wind kept blowing the lid open and allowing rain to get in.

Nice large capacity.

I use for outside storage of pots, garden tools, potting soil and lawn care products. The only negative was the strength it took to pop it together. To get the lid on I had to turn it on its side to step on it to push the connections into place. It took 2 people because of the size. I have a smaller one I put together myself. I am 73.

Bought this mainly for patio cushions and pool supplies, its sturdy and hold quite a bit. Decent quality. Easy to assemble.

The box is great. It holds a lot of pool supplies. It is water proof, so everything stays dry. It's sturdy enough for 2 adults to sit on it.

Shipping and packaging: Arrived on time, packaged well with no damage or issues.Assembly: When we initially thought we assembled this incorrectly, we had some trouble taking it apart again. The trick is to push a flathead screwdriver against the inside "tab", and have another person push against the joint to pop it out. It doesn't necessarily take a lot of brute force to do it, just the right angles based on how the locks are engineered. Other than our misunderstanding, this was very easy to assemble. You do have to really push to lock the pieces together. As others mentioned, use a rubber mallet if needed.Capacity: This fit 6 seat cushions (20x18 inches), 6 pillows (16x16 inches), a tabletop fire pit, a small plastic storage bin with some odds and ends, a large cover for our 6 person dining set (folded up small!), and a cover for our 11' umbrella. I put some very light items in the net - I wouldn't recommend anything heavy that will stretch it out.Durability/Design: I've noticed I have to pull the lid to the left a little to fully close it. I may need to adjust some of the items inside, or the hydraulic lift. I sat on it briefly and it seemed ok (150 lbs), but I don't plan to use it as a seat. I'm not sure the plastic could hold up to that pressure. I appreciate that you can add a lock to the lid. If it holds up well, I'd consider this a great value for the price.Weatherproof: I've only had it a few days, so can't comment on this yet.

Product was fairly easy to assemble. Ifound it easier to pull up the utube video then going by the instructions in the pamphlet. The description of the product says light brown, but it’s actually grey.

Lacks a brace for the lid. It should have one so the lid doesn't bend. Also has slight leak in bottom.

Nice storage box, but somewhat difficult to assemble.  Better instructions are definitely needed.

Pieces came cracked.

The chest is a nice size for storing many outdoor items.  It's a bit flimsy and the sides bow if its too full.  It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.

Storage of deck cushions

Very easy to assemble took about 30 minutes and 1 phillips screwwdriver. Unknown on the waterproofing as only had it for 1 day and no rain scheduled for several more days. Price was very good for the product, sturdy and love the hydrolic lid.

as I was putting together, one panel split a little.  It is great for my amazon deliveries as it holds a lot of stuff.

Not as heavy duty as I expected. Instructions for assembly are terrible. 1st step in photos is attach sides to bottom WRONG. Trying to insert front and back is nearly impossible and cracked one side trying to pry the front and back in place. FYI assemble the 4 sides together then attach the bottom. Requires a rubber hammer and is tough to make the connections. BTW once together it will not come apart. Seems sturdy enough but not sure of the weather proof feature  The top net is a nice feature and works well. Hinges are pretty heavy duty and function well so far. Less stars mainly due to assembly directionsUpdate. Company was quick to reach out and address my issue. Giving an additional star thanks

I bought this to store some cushions for my deck chairs. This seem to be the perfect size with ample room to store additional items such as beach towels, etc. I assembled the storage unit myself and took about 20 minutes. Overall I’m pleased as it looks as advertised. The four-star rating is only because at the end of the day it’s a plastic box.

Pros: good size for balcony, spacious for all my camping stuffs, quality is ok when it remains at the same place, no chemical odor on the boxCons: it’s soft material and it is a little out of shape when it is 2/3 full. It took me some effort to close the lid to maintain the shape. I hope it use hard material to easy hold the shape and become more study. The net has strong chemical odor and I had to throw away.

Overall great deck box. Came with some discoloration and whites spots which was the only disappointment. Works well otherwise.

It took some strong muscles to pop in the tabs.The hydraulic side hinges does not line up with the middle holes.It works without the middle screws.  Overall I like the product

This is a good quality product. The hinges are a bit strong for the weight of the product but I don’t think it will effect the product.

Reinforced lid as too light to set on.

Fairly easy to assemble.  Great for pool item storage.

Love this box!!!!

This deck box is the perfect size for storing all of our patio cushions. All 12 of them. Sturdy and attractive. It was a bit difficult to assemble, you do need two people. We found that a large flat head screwdriver was very helpful but not mentioned. Identify all of your pieces and determine up/down first. If we put another one together today it would probably take about 10 minutes.

I recently got this to store my kids, toys and outdoor equipment that I did not want to get ruined by the rain. It has plenty a space, and even comes with a net to hold stuff on the top. I don’t feel like they should’ve put the net on the top because a lot of the stuff falls out as you pulled it down. However, they should’ve put the net in the inside. Not a bad product, and it was very easy to assemble. It’s lightweight and easy to move as well. If you didn’t like where you put it in the first place will buy again for future use.

Very good product. Sturdy, good value for the price. Sturdy

Easy to put together and holds alot. Great quality.

While the deck box is a nice size mine came with screws and hooks that were missing.  Had to go to a hardware store to get screws.  It is a nice size.  I am hoping that it is waterproof (I have not used it yet.)  It arrived nicely packaged.

Perfectly square when assembled.  We used it for a closet area and it fits perfectly in the corner.

Very spacious! I can put a dozen or more beach towels, plus everyone’s bathing suits. I also keep the sunscreen and aloe Vera in there. There’s a net in the top where I keep those items, so no digging around to find them. It also has those things on the sides to keep the lid open. Even with all those things in there, I still have room to add more stuff.

Good quality, good looking, good edition to the same design smaller box I purchased as well.

initially this product seems very flimsy, however once put together it is very sturdy. I'm not sure I would put a really heavy person on it to sit but it can handle someone under 200 pounds.  so far it is doing the job as intended and keeping all our cushions dry.

good product just not what I needed.

Very easy to put together. I carried the pieces individually to location where I wanted to keep the chest and put them together in about 15 minutes. I wanted to store my outdoor chaise lounge cushion and patio pillows away from harsh weather. They fit perfectly!

Needed this to store my gardening equipment for the winter. Easy to assemble too.

I was not expecting this storage to be so big. It is waterproof and one person easy to install to click in. I was able to fit so many things into the storage including many toys, summer supplies and pillow toppings of outside furniture.

Sturdy storage box which will fit nicely on my porch. Quick delivery!

Great job

As stated above, great purchase. I used mine for storing all of my chicken supplies for my hens. I keep bay, feed, scratch etc in here and has been very weather proof.

Nice product. Assembly was a snap. Recommended

Bought this to try and keep my kids toys from living on my yard.  It fits a lot of things and there’s room for more.

Put together in 15: minutes, tools were all included

I like the room inside and everything stays dry and really helped clean up an area and great extra storage! I’m curious to see how it does in winter.

Love this deck box! Easy to put together and study with more than enough room for what I need.

We like it because it’s waterproof and durable holes are things for outside and we like it to look

Easy to set up, large, waterproof, and sturdy. It's great for holding all of our pool toys/floats etc

Easy to put together and seems pretty solid. Exactly as described and well worth the price.

This was not difficult to put together. Great size and water proof.

Roomy and pretty sturdy.

Very nice and snaps together easily

This is great! It stores a lot, was easy to build and feels like a safe place for some of our outdoor cushions.

This is exactly what I needed for the backyard. It keeps everything tidy and has a ton of space!

Was pleased with container. Exactly what I was looking for

Looks nice in the lanai.Plenty of room,  waterproof.Now I do not have to go out to the garage for my garden tools!

Was looking for a large, weatherproof box to keep at the bottom of the driveway for our delivery drivers to leave packages in the winter.  This one is great!  The size is perfect, and it is weatherproof.  Our UPS, FedEX & USPS delivery persons will not have to worry about driving up our long, uphill driveway when it's snowing or icy!

Love this product,  great deck storage at a great price.Assembly was very easy,  no tools required,It is very sturdy

***ANOTHER UPDATE 04/08/2024***Please do not buy this product.  So much money. I was so happy with it and then all the problems started. The lid had to be held down over the winter with bricks because the lid is so warped and leaks. The metal frame actually broke away from the warping.  Although the seller gave us a full refund I just do not feel good about people making the same mistake in buying this. We are looking for another one but are now so worried that we will have the same issues. So sad. This one will be thrown out 🥺***ANOTHER UPDATE 10/21/2023***I can not tell you how disappointed i was with this purchase.  I love this box.  It is perfect for our large deck and stores so much.  We had a problem with a leak in the lid and the company ended up reembursing us for the whole thing.  Ok, no problem.  We now have to drain the lid every time it rains.  Also with the heat of the summer the top buckled.  WELL this last weekend we were putting everything away from the deck when I noticed that the side of the lid was raised up quite a bit.  We raised it and started to look.  Not only was the top drooping from the heat, it actually pulled the metal frame away from the lid and it is not closing.  We stacked bricks on the top for now to keep the rain and evenually snow out of our stuff.  We live in Ohio.  We did not have a super hot summer.  People in much hotter states, this IS NOT FOR YOU.  So dissappointed**UPDATE**  SELLER MADE EVERYTHING RIGHT AND REIMBURSED US FOR THE DAMAGED PRODUCTWe originally really liked this but now we have problems with the lid being bowed and holding water.  No problem I just lift the lid and let the water fall down the back. The other day I noticed there is a hole inside the lid that is leaking all over my belongings inside. I can seal that up but why??  Where is the water getting in at. Then I have to leave the lid open to drain. This is going to get so nasty in the lid with the constantly sitting water

I had to order 3 of these in order to get 1 functional unit.  Amazon will not let me tell you about the problems with the first one.  The second one had a manufacturing defect.  I currently have unit number 3 and contacted the manufacturer to ask how to purchase an additional divider.  The unit will accommodate 2 dividers, but it only comes with 1.  The manufacturer was of no help whatsoever.  They wouldn’t even provide the part number of the divider.  All they would say is they don’t sell replacement parts.  That’s what you want to hear when you’ve just spent $350 on their product.  The unit has a lot plastic parts, which makes me skeptical of its durability and longevity.  I feel this one will go in the trash in a couple of years.  I wasn’t’ expecting it to be as flimsy as it is.  If kept indoors in a garage or basement, it might be ok, but I don’t see it surviving outdoors on a deck or patio.  UPDATE: Upon unpacking, a screw has already pulled loose from the lid.  As another reviewer stated, you’ll need to secure the metal frame for the lid with adhesive to prevent this from happening. .  I would look elsewhere.

This review is for the item listed as, "YITAHOME 90 Gallon Large Deck Box, Double-Wall Resin Outdoor Storage Boxes, Deck Storage for Patio Furniture, Cushions, Pool Float, Garden Tools, Lockable & Waterproof (White)."I ordered a white one and got an ugly gray one. I had assigned the task  of unpacking and assembling it to two other people and did not know it was the wrong color until they came to me with assembly issues. The struts screw onto the lid with 4 screws in the backplate but two of the screw holes are directly behind the strut and cannot be accessed.  And the hinges are made of PLASTIC!The instructions are mostly pictures and are fantastic and easy to follow but they assigned numbers to everything but did not put numbers on anything so you are constantly flipping to the front of the manual to figure out what they are referring to. Now I have to decide between spending the time and money to paint this or taking it apart and hauling it to UPS for a return.  This took 10 minutes to unpack, another 10 to read the manual and figure out the parts, and another 20 to put it together. It came with a nice little screwdriver but we used the drill motor. There is one nut that needs a wrench. It is metric so we used the crescent wrench. The 20 minutes included time to get the tools. Had to jerry-rig a special tool to get to the screws behind the strut.

I have had this now for about a month and thought it was working well.  But the last few days we have had a lot of rain and now the water sits on top of the bin and it has started to warp.  The water collects on top and when you open the top, the water flows into the bin. The top  must be somehow collecting the water.  When you open it you can hear water inside the top rush to the bottom and then the water comes rushing out from the screws and leaking into the bin. A lot of water is coming out, getting everything in it wet.  Horrible product.  Problem is it’s so huge and difficult to return. Now I am stuck with this bad purchase.  Do not recommend at all!!!! I would give it no stars if I could.Update: now the top is completely warped and has caused the screws to detach from the top frame so now water can get in even easier! This thing is only a few months old! Complete waste of money!

Had the item for just 1 year and it barely made it.  Don't waste your money.  The lid has a metal frame that allows the hydraulic lifts on the side to mount to something and gives the large lid some structure.We had the box on our dock to store cushions, the size was great, but the lid warped over time and then the screws on the lid metal frame on the inside could not hold the hold and then metal frame just popped out.Unfortunately it just can’t last very long and you should plan on throwing it away after a 1 year.  I called customer support and chatted with them.  The phone number was not working per their website, but a live chat was working.They could not replace the part, the warranty was for 1 year , which like always is just missed once the item starts to breakdown, and so I am stuck either trying to fix this box or buying another.  At $300+ I think I will just find another brand.

Be aware !!!  The lid warps and will allow water and insects to enter & no replacement part avalible.Customer Service: the reason this was not wroth even  1 star they  do not offer replacement parts for their defective  parts!!! see photosLid & Hinges are  defected  i noticed the  damage after  1 year and manufactures claim no warranty  NO !!!replacement parts available for their  defective lid.  Both 2X  230 gallon  lids  warps  bend  and allowed  water damage and I  lost all  stored items  to water damage.  Now I kook at eye sore  on my patio 2x 230 gallon storage boxes with lid bend that cant be replaced.I will not buy anything from the company again, and I would not recommend this box to anyone .

I don’t know how this item got an average rating of 4.3 stars? It is difficult to assemble. Doesn’t look like it will last a long time! Tech support is a joke, called three times. Twice the call got disconnected and the third time I left a voicemail. I don’t expect a return call. Avoid if you want to keep you sanity!

DO NOT BUY THIS OR FROM THIS COMPANY!!You don't know that you are responsible for return shipping/postage costs until you recieve the damaged product and want to return it.  What you get is a "postage" label.  Good luck paying postage on a 50+ lb box.  Read the 0ne star reviews.  I agree with them that the parts don't fit/don't align.  Typical product of acountry that Amazon would reject this review if I said it.

I bought this back in May 2023. The lid is separating from the top frame on the lid, and the manufacturing did not wanna to help me out or fix anything on it. It also is a good size for deck box. Whoever read this…make sure you get extra warranty with it

we placed the product on our patio and noticed a gradual warping of the top..(im assuming from the texas sun) the warping has resulted in the supplied top framing screws pulling out which keeps the top from closing all the way.I was expecting a stronger better designed storage container

I took so much time and was very patient to put this together correctly on a calm 75 degree day. Put the bottom on and went well until the last area, where it made one large and 2 small cracks in the plastic. So much for “waterproof”.

I got one of these 230 gallon boxes to store pool floats. It's easy to assemble, but the lid didn't close well. After inspecting it, I found that the metal tubing that comes pre-installed in the lid was causing the problem. You can see this black metal tubing in  the advertisement photos. The pieces were cut too long to begin with and were then welded poorly which left an additional 1/8" or so gap. As a result, the metal frame doesn't properly fit in the channel in the molded plastic lid. Well that didn't stop them from cramming it into place and cracking the plastic. The minor crack isn't a big problem, but because the metal frame is out if square, it twists and warps the lid so it won't close properly. After a few weeks, the screws holding the frame to the lid started coming out. No surprise there. You can't attach a warped, ill-fitting metal frame to a piece of flimsy plastic with sheet metal screws and think it's gonna hold up.  I ended up removing the frame, cutting it to fit, drilling holes throuhg the lid and tubing, then bolting it to the top using some big flat washers so the screw heads wouldn't pull through the plastic. Giant PITA.

We bought this outside tote for storage. About 2 weeks later the top started caving in the middle and now it’s warping up on the sides. We haven’t had this tote for  5 months. Don’t buy unless you want to waste your money.

I bought this for my porch to keep home supplies. The size is great, it is sturdy, installation was easy to figure out but difficult physically to assemble for one person as I am 4'11 100 lbs and did it myself. It's heavy. The product itself is fine BUT THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX -each piece - SMELLED OF DEEPLY ABSORBED CIGARETTES SMOKE like this box was sitting in a wharehouse filled with smoke for a long period of time and since it's like a hard plastic it absorbed the smell. I aired it out on my patio for over a week, sprayed it with odor enzyme spray cleaner, lemon essential oil and pet odor spray and it STILL smells! If it wasn't so heavy I'd return it.

The box itself was easy to put together and looked fine.  The issue is that there were no parts to actually assemble the box,  other than the structure.  I attempted to contact Yitahome via call: nothing.  They recommended contacting through What's Ap and I started a 4 day conversation that ended with: contact Amazon.  Amazon's website says contact Yitahome. Save your time.  Save your money. Hard pass.

Arrived in an undamaged box. After removing all pieces, during assembly we noticed 2 main pieces have significant cracks already. I’ve emailed customer support to see what they will do. For $330 I expect better quality. Very disappointing.

This outdoor chest looks fine until someone sits on it, the top is too weak and no reinforced properly, then it warps and doesn't close well, this will likely compromise the waterproofness but haven't gotten rain yet.It was also harder to assemble due to some plastic parts being slightly out of alignment, so a lot of strength and some fine tuning prying was required to snap them together.I don't recommend this outdoor storage chest, I've had it a week and it already looks cheap. I assume after a few outdoor gatherings someone heavier than 50lbs will sit on it and completely ruin the lid.

I've had this just over three months and now that it's become rainy season in Florida, it's practically useless.  The cover has started to warp on both ends letting water in through the topside and causing the screws to corrode, and I've had to caulk both the inside and outside bottom seams twice in an attempt to keep water and moisture at bay.  Hours wasted trying to redeem this practically useless storage system. If I'd known this was not suitable to use poolside in a Florida pool screen enclosure, I would never ever have purchased it.

So poorly designed, it could not be assembled. At all. The sides have molded plastic tabs - and I’m using that term loosely - with a slight ridge that are supposed to fit into slots in the base.  They are not the same shape.  Either the tabs are too short or the slot is too shallow.  entire purchase is a loss.  I tried using tools Including  a 2 x 4 and mallet as suggested by others. I tried leaving it in the sun to warm and maybe ease up the plastic. after four hours, I still had a pile of parts and was no further along than when I unpacked it.

Doesn’t last more than a year. Plastic screws for the cover was the first thing to go about a month after I put it together. Storage space is what I needed this box for solar inverter, solar charger and batteries.  If it lasted long than a year I would buy one again but not this time. Waste of hard earned money

Horrible, cheap quality. Top and sides warped after first week in the sun by the lake dock. Now gaps are large enough for rain water to get inside, damaging the contents stored.... utter disappointment...

Flimsy, not waterproof and not white. We had to use a heat gun to warm the pieces so we could assemble it. Only keeping it to avoid paying return shipping. Buyer beware!

Item came in damaged, the top screws would not hold the top on, the alignment of the sides stink, I had to place the top on because the screws didn't hold the top to the box. This item is TOTAL TRASH I WOULDN'T EVEN USE IT TO HOLD MY GARBAGE CANS!

We purchased this box in 2022 for some light storage on our patio. It held up well for a couple of months, then started having problems. First, one of the hinges broke and punched a hole through the lid. Then the lid started warping and then the other hinge broke off. The lid is basically un-usable and because I am not in my 1 year warranty window, customer service won't do anything. Stay away!!!!!!! Waste of money.

This thing is much bigger than I expected. It fit everything I needed. The big problem is that water gets inside of it. Each time it rains there is a puddle inside and everything is wet; which totally defeats the use of it. Awful!!!

After nearly an hour of assembly, we dropped in our outdoor furniture cushions just in time before some rain. I was absolutely astonished to open up the storage box the next day to find water had infiltrated between the floor and side wall. Had we not removed our cushions to dry, this would be have been mildew heaven.I reinspected every seam and confirmed the wall portions are well seated flush with floor. Each "clicked in" during assembly.Not sure what to do now.  Possibly some caulking?

We unboxed and attempted mini tries to snap the sides into the base with a little success. It's a poor design and something I hope is fixed.

The lid of the box became warped within a year of having it and lifted up on the sides. Now water gets into the box. Would be nice if company would send a new lid to me.

The box is a good size, but there are some serious quality problems. Overall, it was a good size to fit pool toys, cushions, towels and an electric leaf blower w/ its cord. The box was a pain in the butt to assemble, but I got it done in a couple of hours. The lid was warped right off the bat, but it could still be closed and locked. i thought the warping might resolve itself once assembled. Nope. It just got worse. The warped lid is so bad now, exacerbated by the broken hinge/hydraulic attachment, that it can no longer be securely closed.Sadly, both rear joints have broken and are disconnected from the box lid. The lid is warped to the point that it won't shut now. I reached out to the manufacturer who NEVER responded and Amazon won't help. Crickets.I would NOT recommend this product (or anything else made by this manufacturer). Buy something else. I wasted $300 on a crap product.

I would have liked this if it hadn’t arrived with two defective parts. Two sides are permanently attached at the corner by a plastic strip, however one of mine was broken when it arrived. This appears to be a design issue and not damage during shipping. The baseplate also had a crack in it, which could have been either shipping or design. Either way, two out of four of the main parts were broken on arrival and, at minimum, the corner flaw will allow water in.Disappointed in Amazon as well for offering me a 40% refund unless I return the whole thing. This thing is going in the dumpster and doesn’t need to be shipped anywhere.

To assemble direction says to use rubber hammer to seat a plastic foot with barb.  The first foot I tried would not go two more did and two did not.  I put a 1 foot 2x4 on it b/c the plastic was very flimsy.  The feet would not seat even with that.  I hit the 2x4 progressively harder and it broke to the point this is unuseable.  Another great gift from the CCP, my fault for purchasing.

We purchased two of these deck boxes last spring for our deck to store the outdoor cusions, folding chairs and more over the winter.  As you can see from the pictures,that thru just one summer, fall, winter the tops are badly warped without any weight being on top of them  meaning the seal the company promised was completely gone. We are just hoping that mice or other creatures or damaging moisture got in.I dont know what the warranty is on these nut i would like the seller to contact me to arrange a refund or higher quality replacement.

After only 1 week on my patio the edges warped so badly that bugs and moisture can enter this container. Extremely disappointed. I would return it but I did not keep the box.I would not recommend buying this item if it’s going to be anywhere in the sun.

Shame on me for placing a deck box on my deck.

The container lids warp in direct sunlight and overtime they leak. We’re incredibly disappointed since we bought two of them.

Once you get it together it’s not great but I guess it’s not too bad. Putting the thing together is absolutely horrendous. It takes about six people. If you want misalign screws and a bunch of stripped out plastic then go ahead and purchase this product. It is such a nightmare to assemble it literally should be at least $100 cheaper. I’m having to drill holes and add nuts and bolts all over this thing. It’s literally falling apart

This item I loved at first. It's weather proof, easy to assemble and has a lot of storage space. However, even before I had this a year, the lid warped on the right side and the support rail on the inside pulled off the plastic lid. I haven't' yet figure out how to fix it without damaging the lid. I highly doubt the seller will help at all. If they do, I'll let you know.

The box went together easily, and my initial impressions were good. However, the top warped so badly in the first week that it separated from the attached frame. Can’t recommend.

Thing is super heavy so thought it would be good even though it arrived with heavy damage from shipping. Arranged for a discount just to keep it and repair myself.After a couple months a few or the screws pulled out. Upon inspection it was probably due to the heavy warping of the lid. Will continue to use it for as long as I can, but not happy with it at all.It is heavy and has a large capacity but the lip warping and the screws pulling out is the con,,,,

After one year the lid already warped so bad it won't even seal. Company refuses to warranty or even offer a replacement. Spend all that money for nothing.  Will never buy again.

I love the double wall on this.  Makes for a smooth and strong  interior . I am not using it as storage.  I did a lot of cutting on this . Excuse the mess but you can see how much I cut out and still very sturdy. The company that sells these won't fix a wrong. They offered a discount but it's completely useless to me as it's not a storage box for me. Be careful dealing with them they don't understand how refunds work. Got ripped off on a refund.

In one of the pictures listed on this item, you can count the number of big seat cushions being around 20 with other smaller cushions (roughly “fits 3 sets of cushions for 7-pcs”).However, my single set wicker furniture can not hold 10 seat cushions along with the back rest pillows in this. I feel like they need to realistically update their pictures as this mislead my purchase thinking I can get my 10 big cushions in there along with other smaller cushions.

When this arrived it was missing the below!Hydraulic arms x2Divider x1Locking mechanism x1Anchors x4Screw pack x1

I would NOT recommend you buying this. Its Really horrible Quality, I had gotten this as a GIFT for a family friend who recently purchased a New House. Turns out this was NOT a good gifting experience. IT had missing top lid cover, hinges and all necessary screws to assemble this product. Making it USELESS. I was very Disappointed. Horrible Quality

Other than the warping problem, I really like the product... it wasn't difficult to put together.  I'm very disappointed that it warped after just 2 days in the spring sun... and it wasn't that hot out.. 75 degrees.  I wonder what will happen in August when it's pushing 100 degrees

Huge storage box for our patio cushions.  Super impressed with company.  Once we had put together we noticed a crack in corner of lid which must have happened during delivery.  I was worried that this would make it no longer waterproof.  I requested a new lid and the company sent a new box immediately without having to hassle sending back old box!  Really impressed with customer service!  Updated 2/20/24 the box lid must have a design flaw in it.  The lid began warping a little pretty quickly after receiving it but has gotten worse over time.  It is in a shady spot outside so not due to sun but it is definitely warped and then when it rains it collects water.  A friend got the same one and have the same problem.

My husband is a retired contractor who can build or fix anything.  This box challenged him to frustration.  Instructions are useless.  DO NOT BUY.  and note this is an outside vendor so no free or easy return.

I bought the 90 gallons deck box. Looked OK, but was impossible to assemble because screws don't fit.

Does this keep things dry in the rain? Yes. Does it hold a few things? Also yes… can you “pack” it full? Absolutely not. It will easily bulge and no longer close even with cushions just “fit” in. I also don’t feel this is super trust worthy as a bench but it could seat a person or two. For what you pay it does the job.UPDATE: after 11months, this now leaks at the bottom getting our cushions wet and musty. The screws are stripping and backing out of the lid as it warps so much it no longer closes. So incredibly disappointed, was hoping to at least get a FEW years out of this before we had to upgrade.

I loved this box after I put it together. It was perfect for our needs. After sitting out in the sun for two days, I noticed the top starting to warp. I contact the seller, and they told me to put heavy weights on top of the box. I did that for several days, and it didn’t really seem to help. We contacted the seller and they gave us a full refund for the box. We’ve had the box now for a couple weeks, and now it looks like the top is separating from the metal framing (see pictures). The seller was very nice in refunding the money to us, however, I feel that this product is a piece of you know what. Don’t waste your money on this item.

Packaging needs to be addressed/improved. I had two delivered and both had minor damage. The delivery box is very large and fairly heavy so you can imagine how it can get dropped, etc. during shipping.Assembly: assembly design is simple and very easy to understand / follow instructions. Problem is that the pieces need to fit fairly precisely...and they don't. At least, on the two I assembled they didn't, and the problem was the same for both products. It's difficult to explain w/out a video or something, but suffice it to say, that if you get a similar product you need some muscle to get the panels to click together. The first one was a nightmare b/c I didn't know what the problem was. I actually ended up having to make some modifications (think power saw!) to get the panels to fit together. The second one was still an ever-loving b*tch, but I figured out a work-around much quicker (I flipped the panels/bottom over and using a 2x4 and mallet hammered the panels together - this was not wonderful but way better/less destructive than my first assembly.) I'm not a contractor but have build some furniture from scratch and put together plenty of pieces that just need assembly. This wasn't a clueless dude fumbling around. This was very difficult.Customer Service: the reason this was not 1 star is because I had a replacement unit shipped fairly quickly when I originally contacted them with the initial cracked (small crack) bottom panel. The person I spoke to was informed and the process was easy/quick. Because they shipped an entirely new unit instead of just a replacement for the damaged bottom panel, I got two of these for the price of one. The damage was minor and the first unit is fully functional, just not defect-free. The 2nd unit also had some damage on the corner of the top panel, but I have no need for another unit and honestly don't want to put another together.Hope this is helpful.

See below: this is ridiculous. They still have not called me. I am very dissatisfied with this product. Please be aware…. 8/27/24First and foremost know that I never write reviews. But I had to on this one.  I purchased the  YITAHOME XXL 230 Gallon Large Deck Box box unit for my deck storage. There were no instructions inside the box. All the pieces were warped. I finally put the box together and I was very dissatisfied. I tried to call and contact customer service and no one answered me. Hopefully  YITAHOME Can contact me and come up with some solutions regarding this. It’s too big to return and I am very dissatisfied.

The Good: Easy Assembly. The Bad: The design of this box is to be cheap construction. The lid does not seat properly when closed. The two joints that require fasteners, does not form a tight seal. Probably would keep light rain out but for sure a highway for bugs to get inside and make a home. I had to caulk the entire vertical seam. The other vertical joints are continuous but at the top is a big ol cavity. The ugly: This is the size I needed. If your are flexible in what size and color, check out Lifetime products. They have a line of outdoor storage that used to be good. I have one that is many years old and has been bumped around the country. Still in excellent condition. Unfortunately they did not have the size I wanted. So now I'm stuck with this one. Another bad is it really has a strong chemical smell. Hopefully that goes away in time.

Assembling was very quick - two people needed for the lid - product seems sturdy and it attractive - HOWEVER we stored all our chair and sofa cushions before an afternoon rainstorm - BUT were very disappointed to find that rain water had infiltrated the unit and soaked some cushions - we are awaiting an explanation from the vendor - seems like it could have been via the hinge areas OR the base section which is simply snapped into place and does NOT have any sort of rubber gasket at the seam!

Love the storage space and height, but the warping of the lid in the top right corner is a concern that this will not last long. I have reached out to the seller since returning this is not easy once assembled and their 30 day easy returns policy is misleading (less refund if used?), how do you setup the box without drilling in the screws..

At first, I had an issue with the box they mailed me so they sent me a new one which was nice. However, as time went by (and less than a year) it seems like there’s several issues with this box. I suspect the quality of materials isn’t great.First issue is that the top of the box started to sink in, so water piles up on top.Second issue is the side hinges are flimsy. One broke off in a month of use but I let be since the other one allowed for soft close. But recently the second hinge broke randomly so now it shuts open and closed really hard which I don’t like.Also, if there is any extra stuff in there even slightly touching the sides, the top doesn’t close unless you force it.

To us assembly ease, and durability are important when picking storage boxes. And this item was perfect on paper until we found out the lid has few marks. I understands if few small scratches here and there on the side of the deck storage boxes. But this is right on top of the lid. Also didn’t help the color of the lid is black and the swivel marks are in beige

NOT SUN WORTHY!!  We bought 2 of these in XXL for our large deck with large cushions. One had to be placed in the morning only sun and the other one is in the shade nearly all day. The very first summer, the one in the morning sun is warping up 2-3 inches, pulling out the screws completely at the hinge area... (we live on the coast in Washington, so not terribly warm here 99% of the summer). Waterproof/bug proof NO LONGER....UGH. Since the warranty is long lone....Going to try to use a heat gun to 'unwarp' it and install a metal strap to hold new screws. Wish me luck. I should have really LOOKED at all the pictures people have posted of the warping issue, I would have skipped these boxes! But, I only looked at the star rating....

One year in and this container now leaks due to a warped lid which has caused the screws to disengage. Can’t use it for my beach towels or cushions any longer as intended. Very disappointing for a $300.00 item.

3rd box we bought. Others are brands available at the orange and blue big box home improvement stores. In short, I’m disappointed in this product. Walls are thin and flimsy. The plastic is thin especially in the handles and the corners. Showing weakened area even as new. I would not recommend for the price.

The box is not as sturdy as it should be after paying that much. Noticed that it was damaged when taking it out of the box. Not worth the money. I’m sure the seller would work with the damaged but it is too heavy to try and return it.

This review is for the Yitahome xxl 230 gallon brown rattan deck box. Chose this because the xl size would fit the cushions from a new patio sofa. I was pleased when I saw the metal bar all along the lid. I thought it would keep the lid weighted and prevent warping, but I was wrong. In less than a week I saw that the lid had already warped. I don’t live in an extreme heat area. Pretty normal summer temperatures here and it wasn’t exposed to sun all day long.I contacted the company with pictures and explained the problem. Showed proof of purchase date. All they offered was $50. Said a replacement lid wasn’t possible. For the price of this, I would expect better quality of the product and customer support when their product fails. It’s no longer waterproof and a perfect entry point for insects. I haven’t heard back from them after I replied that their offer didn’t seem fair for this type of failure.I hope they’ll redesign the lid so their product won’t continue to fail for other customers. Very disappointed in this product. If the lid hadn’t failed, it would have been an attractive way to store the cushions and keep them protected from the weather. I don’t recommend purchasing this at all.

I gave this a rating of 2 because the lid warped in our Texas heat. It would be much better if kept under cover.

My husband assembled this perfectly-it’s warped, needs a lock just to keep the lid closed. Only kept it because it would require a break down of the sides to return. Do NOT buy this junk.

Totally different color than the previous one I ordered! Also, it has two cracks! See attached pictures!

Lasted one summer.  Lid warped, I assume because of heat 90 degrees or so.  Then screws popped!  Waste of money.  Total disappointment.  Do not buy!

I haven't even had this two months and the lid warped and is getting worse. I bought it to keep my cushions out of the weather. At first I really liked it, but the lid is so warped that it defeats the purpose. Don't waste your money....

I really hate to leave a bad review because I know it really hurts the manufacturer but I also know for myself I count on reviews to help me decide about a product. I was excited to get this box especially after my husband had no trouble putting it together and said how sturdy it was and how impressed he was with it. And he's not an easy nut to crack. I looked at quite a few before selecting this one but what attracted me to it was that there were no holes through the handle slots which would allow things to get inside since I since I was going to store bird seed in there. It has not been mistreated at all nor used as a bench. Now the top has warped to where it does not fully seal and there is lifting at both far ends and I now have ants in the box. Of course you could say ants might have been small enough to get in any way but it won't be long before other Critters will be able to get in also. Disappointing to spend so much on this and have it warp.

I bought this for my small garden tools. Wasn't happy that it snaps together, light plastic, and will easily come apart because of the lame way its put together.

In order to attach the sides to the bottom the sides have large tabs that are pressed into slots in the bottom. Unfortunately it does not easily click into place and needed a significant amount of force to press into place. See photo.If you can’t rig up something to squeeze the parts together you may not be able to assemble this fully.

The pistons broke day two.  Trying to get Amazon Customer Service to find extras.  Don’t call the phone number listed for support.  The manufacturer is zero support/ refers you back to Amazon who wants you to ship this giant thing back.  So frustrating.

UPDATE: 1/13/2024Purchased 6/30/2023 - Today, about six months later, I looked outside and noticed the deck box lid wasnt sitting flat.  When going to check it out - the lid appeared to be warped.  I open the lid and the screws were ripped out, and the top is too warped to even push back into place with my hands.  It still opens and closes, but the weather protection is compromised.  When opened, water poured out of the inside of the lid.Very disappointed this didnt last more that 6 months. Lowered to 2-stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Very big, kind of challenging to assemble - would recommend a rubber mallet.The lid is heavy duty, very well made unit.

The storage box was a breeze to assemble and it was water tight for 4 months.  Then after only 4 months of sun and rain in Florida, the lid warped and pulled away from the frame and curled up at one corner and away from the base.  Now critters and rain can get into my storage box that I had purchased it to avoid.  Without a new top, my storage is no longer secure.  I am now worried about the second storage box I purchased 2 months later.  Will it happen again ?  I want 2 additional units for our dock, but will wait to see how they handle this customer service issue. If the manufacturer could ship me a new lid and hinge/frame I can repair the unit.  Thank you

There is a deformation for the deck lid secured to the top, but bottom side arrived for the crack in it several inches long and screw heads actually stripped out.

The side panels don't click into the bottom panel so the box isn't very stable. Screws are provided to connect the lid to the sides and that works great. I wish they would have used the same construction for the bottom panel. Too bulky and thus cumbersome to return :(

I bought one of these in May. It went together with minimum difficulty. Based on that experience, I ordered a second one last week. The unit I received, had a different hinge and latching mechanism. In addition, it was a bear to assemble. It does not snap together. I ended up having to use a rubber mallet. In addition, the predrilled holes are not aligned properly which puts the lid out of alignment and locking mechanism is out of alignment. . Also, it came out of the packaging with a number of small cracks. Now that it’s together, it may be more of a hassle to run return it than to live with the short comings. I will check with Amazon customer service. I would definitely not worth $329.

This is more incidental splash resistant than weatherproof. Don't put it in an area it will get rained on. This is the biggest reason for the low rating Im giving. When I am looking for something waterproof and you advertise it as such, it should be waterproof. This is not.Installation was a bit more tricky than it should be. Takes some flipping over of pieces a few times to understand what the pictures are showing, and the snap in part is quite hard. Some go in nicely, many do not. I had to have myself and 2 other guys to get enough weight to make a couple of the areas snap in place.Also the advertised 1000lbs rating of people on top like the picture shows is not even close. Id say 250lbs can be safely placed on top, anything more risks the sides falling over and it collapsing.

Top warps and screws pullout of the plastic lid as it separates from the metal frame supporting the lid. Lasted 3 months before problems arose. Do not buy!

Large and seemingly waterproof but was a nightmare to put together because the tongue and grooves didn’t line up. We had to Macgyver it with clamps and wedges to finally make it fit together. Definitely wasn’t a 7m build.

Easy to out together but screws missing and the last 2 screws didn’t line up!  Very Frustrating because once I got it together I could not take it apart to send back. Once you pop the sides into the slots, it’s together forever. But then there are screws to reinforce it and if they don’t line up properly or you’re missing screws, there’s no way to return because you can’t take it apart.Also, it is not White. It is definitely light gray/with blue tent, which really upset me too because I wanted white.  Beware

The lid curled up on the lids front corners after the sun heats the plastic.

I bought the 230 gallon version of this as it was cheaper than the Keter and Suncast products we normally use. Ive assembled close to 30 of these at the resort I own. I am very competent at assembling chests like this.This unit is very poorly blow molded. The sides slide onto and clip in to the base. They 'snap' together. There was no way at all to get them to do this. The blow molding as uneven and had lips that prevented assemly. Only because I did not want to return it did I spend an hour messing with it. ultimately shaving down all the tabs (a very laborious process). The lid hinge doesn't line up and had to be twisted and contorted to get the screws in place. Some of the screws used by the manufacturer to hold metal supports in place (installed at the factory) were loose and cannot be tightened as the plastic is stripped.The front panel bows out slightly, so closing the lid has the lid catch go inside instead of outside the box, it also means the divider is loose.Steer well clear of this. Any money you might save is long gone on the extra work you'll put in to get it together. Even after all the assembly effort you'll be left with a saggy box that I suspect will last a year or two, rather than the 10 or more my other brand boxes are lasting.Note: I bought the 230 gallon. version. I have no idea if this is a universal problem across all sizes, but I won't be buying another to find out

3 screws popped out of resin top that were holding the metal bar frame. Now it doesn’t fit secure

Great amount of space however after 3 days in direct sunlight the same side on all 3 boxes I have bent upwards. Not meant for hot weather I guess.  Otherwise besides being a pain to get the lid on and the warp, the item holds a ton of stuff and still looks empty. Just wish it was made of better material, at least the lid

I have had this less than two months and out of direct sunlight, and this has completely warped already. Do not buy this, if you live in a warmer climate.

Received the box unassembled in a large flat, well packaged box. Condition is great. The wife and I put it together in about 30 minutes. Easy to build. Light weight enough to move with two people after assembled. Heavy enough to seem sturdy. Fairly expensive but I think it’s worth it. Looks great. I would buy another deck box from this brand if I need it.

The rattan storage box is well made (very thick), definitely waterproof (already rain tested), has plenty of room and worth the money.  I assembled it by myself and must say it was truly a task.  Once put together, it looked very nice but didnt realize how huge it was going to be.  I would absolutely recommend!!!!

Wasn't sure what to expect, but this was a pleasant surprise. Unit is well built and sturdy. Hasn't rained yet so I can't say for sure that it's waterproof, but the lid fits over the sides and there is no obvious way for it to leak. Unless you put it somewhere that it stands in more than an inch of water.Assembly is mostly very simple. The instructions are generally very good and everything fit perfectly. Two things could have been better. The instructions refer to the top/bottom and side panels by letter but the panels are not marked. The sides and top are obvious because of the screw holes for the hinges. The bottom is not. I had to guess which direction was the front, which is odd because the instructions make a point that it will only fit one way. The word "Inside" was molded into the top side of the bottom panel, so it would have been a simple matter for them to also mark "Front" or include an arrow or something. The front and back panels are each attached to one of the sides with a sort of hinge (just plastic that runs the width of the panel and folds). There are tabs in the front/back and sides that insert into the bottom and click into place. The first panel is easy because you can angle it to get the tabs to fully insert, but the rest have to be pushed in perpendicular and that proves a little difficult. They advise you to use a rubber mallet and that did help because you have to drive it in a bit and a steel hammer could damage the panels. I wound up using a wide putty knife tapped into the slot in the bottom to get the tab to fully insert, then used my body weight to push down and get it to snap into place. Worked fine.All in all, just a few minor things, none of which proved insurmountable. Again, very sturdy, and I would buy another product from this company at this point without hesitation.

We purchased the 150 gal white storage container. When I was unpacking the pieces and taking them back to my deck, I was happy with the double sided thickness. The panels were sturdy, and did not bow or warp at all as handled. So far so good. Got out the directions. They were total crap! Barely indicated what you had to do. Just basic pictures. But screws all fit, no hardware missing. Even included a cheap screwdriver. Now came the fun part. Under the cautionary statement on the first page, it says “align the holes before assembly and snap into place (the tabs) with a slight tap”. My hubby is a 44 year career engineer, and had issues. The directions say “note that the front and back of part D, which is the bottom piece, are different, so pay close attention during installation “. Well, the piece is clearly marked “inside “ but we could tell no difference at all in the front or back edge. We finally took a shot and lined it up so you could read the word “inside” as you would open the lid. We guessed correctly! Then, we started tapping the tabs into the slots . Well, we tried. A couple popped right in, but with way more than a “slight tap”. After cracking a couple tabs, we stepped back and looked over the situation because I was aggravated that the tabs were breaking. At my suggestion, we flipped the box over, and tried tapping in the tabs from the BOTTOM of the box! Worked perfectly! No more broken ones. I was so miffed that I would have sent it back at this point, except we damaged it assembling, and those good ‘ole directions say that “once installed, the product cannot be detached”. Oh, great. So all in all, we have a very sturdy box, assembled, with some cracked tabs that don’t seem to be much of an issue, yet, that looks very nice. But they absolutely have to do something about improving the directions, like adding WRITTEN instructions and tips on better assembly procedures! I despise following assembly to the letter and damaging the product in the process! Ridiculous For what we paid!

I bought the 260 gallon x-large box. Unfortunately it came missing some of the hardware. It would take up a lot of space to describe everything they did to make it right but suffice to say they made it more than right. It is a great box, not difficult to assemble at all (I did it without help) and it is very well made. Great product and even better customer service. Highly recommend.

The box is very roomy and it looks nice. The instructions were not clear at all. My husband and I  took about an hour to construct it, and we both are usually adept at putting things together.  It isn't water tight unless you caulk some of the connecting areas, which we did. Despite these criticisms, we are very happy with the end result.

I purchased this box to store my crabbing gear and camping stuff at my lot on the coast. Almost 11 months later, I have noticed (like others) that the top has become warped and some of the screws have pulled away from the lid on one corner. I think a lot of it has to do with it being in the direct sun all day and the drastic weather we've had this past year in Louisiana — first extremely hot then freezing. Even with the warping, I see no signs of water intrusion. I am going to do what one of the other reviewers suggested and add 4" hook & eye closures to the corners to prevent further warping and possibly try some longer screws to replace the ones that have pulled out. Customer service was very responsive and offered a partial refund.

The product came undamaged and in good condition.  Instructions are just pics but were easy to follow, hardest part is making sure you grab the correct screws for each step.  Its so easy to assembly you'll want to try without the instructions until you grab the wrong hardware and it doesn't fit.I found the product to be rugged and mostly well constructed (see below).  When fully assembled, it seems very strong.  I can easily get on the top without it buckling under the weight.  The walls seem sturdy and do not flex and bow out like many single wall storage containers.  My main concern for the future is if the corners become brittle and break due to UV.Assembly was very easy, except for the hinge insert nuts in the top.  They are poorly attached and will come out easily.  I plan on removing them all and epoxying them in to hold better.Only other negative comment is that there is a small gap where the sides are attached.  When you put the sides together an push them tight, the gap disappears, but comes back when you put in all the screws.  I can see where water could get inside in a driving rain, so I put silicone caulk at these joints, as well as the joints at the floor.  There are also small gaps around the lift supports that mice could enter, so I had to seal these.Overall, I am very pleased with the results and would recommend this product.  For the money spent and time consumed vs building my own, it is a bargain.

Serves its purpose well. It was pretty simple to assemble, and does keep our outdoor cushions dry and clean, as intended. Only issue is our lid sags in the middle, which means rainwater accumulates on the lid. Doesn't leak, but is a little aggravating to have to sweep the rain puddle off the lid after each rain. The mfr was very responsive, and did offer to give us a partial credit to try and address the issue, but did not offer to send a new lid.

We had ordered two of these boxes during Prime day.  The first one went together nicely and we were happy with the quality.  The lid is a soft open/close lid so that was nice as well.  On the second box, however, the metal frame of the lid was not square on the left side.  Because of this the three holes on the bracket for the hydraulic shock would not line up and could not be attached to the lid.  I emailed Yitahome to see if they could send us a replacement lid and offered to ship the defective lid back.  They simply offered to send us an entire new complete deck box and said we could keep the other one also!!!  What a great company.  I'm not sure what we're going to do with this other box though.  Ill probably experiment with the lid and see if I can come up with a fix and attach the bracket somehow.

The lid bows in the center and collects rain water. I expected the lid to be rigid. Now rain accumulates for mosquito breeding.  Do not buy if you will be in exposed place on porch

I would have given higher rating but you can see when you are lied to. This box is NOT waterproof, cannot be. The joints on the bottom have openings. So manufacturer knew about this but lied. Otherwise it is decent. You need to have it covered to protect from rain.

Hard to put together. Needs a warning for adults not to sit on it. The top is warped.  Not made very well.

The first one we bought was perfect and we love it.  This is the second one and we are disappointed.  One of the side panels are warped and won’t sit in the bottom because it’s curved and the lid was broken.  We didn’t return because we needed it badly.  I glued the lid but the side will leak because we can’t get the panel to straighten.  Also little mice or whatever and slip in if outdoors.  Very disappointed

The blow mold is weak and the top holds water. The pre drilled holes have the side seams gapped

There is a major defect.  The 'snap' system is designed incorrectly.  The walls have to be leaned in and then pulled back for the inserts to go into the hole well enough to snap in.  You cannot just push down.  This is problematic in 2 ways.  First, the front long wall and short side wall are hinged together.  you can snap in the front wall but then you can not snap in the side wall because you cannot lean it forward.  Second, because you have to slide the second long wall and side wall down hinges on wall one, you cannot lean either piece in to snap.  This is the 2nd Yitahome 260 gallon deck box we have ordered.  We had the same problem with the first one but were hoping that was a defect as the box is really of high quality.  Both are inside a shed so they are still usable for our purpose but they could not be used outdoors.

The product assembles easily. The front corner of the storage box lid warped in the sun after a few days. I have to weight the corner to ensure water and pests do not get into the container

Overall, I'm neutral about this product. It's a little complicated for one person (and I'm an engineer) to put together as in some situations during assembly, you need three hands. My biggest complaint is that the 90-gallon storage adequately holds my eight patio cushions with some degree of stuffing, but adequately. The problem arises when I try to close the lid; the plastic front wall/siding is too soft and bows under stress, not allowing the lid to latch. For a fix, I purchased from HD a 2' threaded rod, drilled through the plastic walls, and ran it front-to-back, somewhat stiffening the bow-effect and correcting the issue.

The instructions say you should be able to simply line up the sides and bottom and snap them in. This didn't work for me as I tried several times without luck.  I had to use a rubber mallet and turn the box upside down and tap each plastic fastening hooks on the side panels into the holes in the bottom section.  I tried to be careful, but I cracked one of the openings surrounding one of the hooks.A simple snap-in may work on a smaller deck box, but I don't believe it will easily work on a 150+ Gallon Box.  Recommend the manufacturer use a different technique to fasten the sides to the bottom.

The lid holds a little water. it has no dome up in the center of the lid.

the lid plastic had a significant split.  Noticed after assembly and placement.  disappointing.

Awkward to put together.  Some items didn't line up.

I had to use a wood clamp to press the sides into place.Once together seems pretty sturdy and won't blow away in a wind storm.

The deck box is a great size to hold all the patio cushions.  It seems to be very weatherproof although we haven’t gone through a winter with it (only summer).  It did not get the cushions wet from the rain.  The only problem we had was that the top lid warped and the screws ripped out.  I wrote to the company and they were unable to send me a new lid, however they did issue a full refund to me.  I thought as far as my communication with the company, they were very responsive and they did the right thing.

Placing the sides to the base doesn’t work. The only reason I am keeping it is cause it is a hustle to send it back. Try to find something tat was made in America instead.

Located under a covered patio.  When washing patio floors, water got in through the bottom.  Items inside got wet.  I don’t recommend left outside in the elements.  Assembly was rather easy.  Looks good and keeps patio items neat and out of sight.

Box is sturdy and decently made. Our issue was with the lid…when it arrived, there were a couple of screws along the longest part of the lid that were stripped…we honestly didn’t think much about it due to where they were so we didn’t think they’d become an issue, but within a week of it being put together and used, most of the screws in the brace of the lid have fallen out. When I contacted the seller, they didn’t have just the lid in stock so my only option was to take it apart and try to ship it back for a refund…. this thing is heavy so that wasn’t an option. So now we have a box with a broken lid…this thing is too expensive to break within a week of having it.

This is the second of three boxes which we have ordered. As others have said , the assembly looks simple but it is not as the sides DO NOT click easily to the base. I actually called customer support and the individual who responded also said it was an easy click. I have a picture of my 160 lb son STANDING on the corner between the panels on top of the  unit to no avail. I did use a mallet and turned the unit sideways and that helped. I hope the units make it through the winter.

The box was easy to assemble.  By adding caulking to the joints helps make the box water tight.  Big problem is the lid.  Over the pasted few months the lid has warpped.

So, I was banging on this trying to get the tabs to fit with a rubber mallet (and it cracked on me in a couple places) when we decided to flip it over and just sit on the areas where the tabs weren't attached. It took two people to put it together and it was a pain. We will see how well it holds up with the cracks in it, but seems to be ok. It's fairly sturdy. I can use it as a giant crate for my dog (j/k). The big test will be to see if critters get into it to nest.

The screws ended up stripping out of the plastic and caused the lid to warp on both boxes we bought. Design flaw that shouldn’t happen on such an expensive boxUpdate 10-12-23 Seller contacted me and after receiving pictures refunded me for both boxes. Appreciate the integrity of the seller to stand behind their product!  Rare these days.

The box was great at first for storing our outdoor furniture cushions. It was delivered in April so we’ve only had it shy of four months. We left town last week and when we got home yesterday the kid is warped and isn’t closing right, there was rain water in it. The screws that hold the metal frame to the lid are ripped out and stripped and won’t go back in. Very disappointed and hoping a new lid can be shipped.

Small should have gotten the next size

Easy to put together. Looks nice.But seems flimsy and cheap for the price of it.Look into buying east oak brand. Solid materials.

The white bin is actually light blue/purple (This is why I didn’t give it 4 stars). It was easy to assemble and luckily matches our outdoor colors, so we opted to keep it. Also - It successfully held up during tropical storm winds this week as well.

It is a good sturdy, waterproof deck box but everytime it rains there is a puddle on the center of the cover.  Other than having to always open the lid for the water to run off after rain it is a nice deck box for the price.

I ordered a white box.  It’s not white.  It’s a light gray.  It’s serving it’s purpose, it looks like it will hold up OK.

This box is exactly what I needed, size wise to store my pool accessories. Unfortunately, the build quality is only average. The front wall bows outward enough that the lid won’t close. The screws holding the lid to its frame are stripped out of the plastic of the lid on one end. I had to make repairs with JB Weld to a brand new product.

The item cannot be used for sitting on it. The lid bows in the center even without any weight applied. The back panel goes inside a little.

When I first put it together, it seemed Great! After a few weeks, I noticed it was wet inside. Looked at the unit and idk if it got deformed or what but the lid is off when it closes and left about a 1/2 gap for rain to get in.

Product was easy to assemble however the arms for the lid support just fell apart.  Quality of product is borderline.

Product is sturdy, but lid needs to be redesigned.  The lid bows in the middle and accumulates water.  Disappointing, since it could have been designed with a steel bar to maintain shape.  Also, because of the bow critters can find a way in.

The lid doesn’t stay fully shut and water gets in. I’ve checked all of the installation parts and it seems to be done right so it appears to be defective. Like others said it’s too big for me to feel like returning it…

Arrived with a few broken or chipped edges

The lid was closed and was ripped all the way off in the wind. Don’t feel like this should of happened. Where & how do I get a replacement lid?  This was an expensive storage bin that is now useless without a lid!

The media could not be loaded.
                



This started out great. Easy to put together,  cushions fit great, keeps cushions protected. The top somehow warped at the hinge area after only having it a week.

Heavy/good quality...fits together securely. However if you are looking for a white container to match rails,deck,furniture etc then find something else. In no world is this thing white! Ruined the entire look of our patio.

Very heavy, difficult to coordinate the base.  Instructions for top lift are impossible to understand.  If I could have sent back, I would have but the effort to lift, place in car, take to shipper, etc outweighed it.

All the screws in the lid was stripped out and will need replaced

Hi,This came, just put together but missing the front latch, can this be sent?

My deck box showed up slightly damaged.  I think the lid closes harder than it should.

If you're looking for an assembly challenge that takes you through various stages of annoyance, despair, anger and finally (?) triumph, then look no further. No instructions in the box, no instructions to be found on the vast World Wide Web either. You're on your own. You got what you paid for.Other reviews are right about the tabs not snapping easily into slots. Not surprised other people broke a few of those tabs. The version of the kit that we got did, however, have all the screws needed, so I didn't have to get new screws at the hardware store like one of the other reviewers. Eventually it makes sense how to screw the lid on. Hopefully it will be water proof.

Requires two people to assemble, but was what we wanted for storing all our cushions on lanai.

A little stiff to assemble, also seemed a little smaller than I expected, oars don’t quite fit , but I didn’t formally check dimensions against specs

I originally purchased this item due to the size and the favorable reviews. Upon receiving the item it had a small rip and tear in the box it was delivered in. I checked the item thoroughly and there didn't seem to be anything wrong with item.The directions were fairly easy to follow, but I would recommend putting the sides together upside down on a firm flat surface and then setting the bottom on the connected sides, front and back. Then taken a rubber mallet and snapping the bottom to the sides in that manner. Much easier process. All screws were properly identified and how they needed to be applied.As you can see by the pictures I supplied my unit warped as it was facing the west and recievithe hot sun. I didn't realize how bad it had become until the backside of the top inside metal frame had separated from the formed plastic top. The screws actually were pulled out from the plastic. With this being said I would have done two things to insure this would not have happened.After weeks of negotiating with the maker and supplier of the product they finally agreed to send me an entire new box. I expressed to them how I believed they could make their product better by including side, back and front lockdowns on all four corners to insure the integrity of the box. I took the initiative to put 4" hook and eye attachments on each corner. I would then suggest upon receiving your box that you check each screw in the underside top of the box to make sure they are secure.I was frustrated at first with the company but I stood my ground, always trying to be kind and sincere with the people I was dealing with, until they realized that maybe they could make a better product that won't warp in the hot sun. I reviewed my new box within a month of my first complaint. I am giving them 4 stars for their customer service but I would only give them 2 stars on the box itself until they fix the possible warping. I hope this helps. So far the 4" hook and eye seem to be working. I will let you know after next summer to see if they did the job.

Fairly easy to assemble. A bit heavy, definately 2 people to get it done. Had it up and ready in about an hour.Update: I suppose since it is so big, the top seems to droop in the middle. We had some rain, and a puddle formed on top. It was about 24 inches x 12-18 inches, and maybe a quarter inch deem in the middle.

The box may be weather proof if sheltered.  It is not water proof.  Caulking the junctures around the bottom should be considered to enhance it's  water proof quality.

I missed the message the company sent when I posted my prior review.  They did offer a replacement or refund.  I would recommend thos product

It was almost the kind of easy assembly I was hoping for. I thing they could have constructed part of it that required tools to make it a no tool assembly. I unboxed and put together the box but still have not finished assembling the tool required pieces because I am too busy

Directions just say side panels will "Click" into place.  And it says use a rubber mallet if you can't get it to click.  Well only was able to get one tab to click by hand.  Used mallet. did work. Had to turn chest upside down and mallet worked well. Use just enough force to make it click but cracked the plastic in a few places. probably not waterproof now

The product was what we hoped for:  big and solid. But, it arrived damaged.  The customer service folks fixed it up quickly and with no fuss.  Five stars for their customer service.  We could tell from the undamaged parts that this was the really solid item we wanted and we are looking forward to getting one once it comes back in stock!

It was easy to put together. It took about 30 mins  very large. I like that it had a piece to make it two separate compartments.  The only negative the top does not close as tight as I would like.  I am guessing with a lock it would stay tightly closed.  Very sturdy

Ordered this product and found it was missing all the hardware to assemble.  Contacted the company and they sent an entire new storage box at no charge.  Thank you for making this right!Word of caution, be careful with assembly or plastic may crack.  Install bottom panel from the top to avoid cracking the plastic.

Resin lid warps making the box not waterproof. The screws pulled out of the lid braces letting the weather and bugs in.  Ruined my deck cushions and pillows.Not worth the money.

I had a problem where the lid was internally taking on water. The box was dry until you opened the lid and some water would drip down into the box out of holes near the hinges. I contacted the company and they offered $50 if that would satisfy me. But, I like the box and just wanted a replacement lid.  They don't stock replacement parts so instead they sent me an entire new box. That's great customer service!  The general quality of the box and ease of assembly is great.

This feels way sturdier than the Keter xxl that it replaced. My one complaint is, I wish the bottom didn’t just press fit on, a few screws into the side walls would be a good and cheap addition to the design.

Update: The top won’t stay closed unless you use a lock. I would have preferred that when you shut it that it stays down. Therefore, I’m downgrading from 5 to 4 starsI wasn’t sure about the quality given some of the reviews, but I just finished putting it together and I’m pleased. It looks great.Everything fit together as expected. I’d suggest laying it on the side if you are assembling the lid alone. Otherwise, you need two people so that one person can hold in place as you screw. It took me 45 mins to build this alone. I’m sure that I could have done it more quickly, but I did it while watching football.Also, I tried using my electric screw driver, but I don’t think it was as effective. Plan to build this manually.The box itself is more spacious than I expected so I’m happy about that. I like that there are joins to hold the lid. Only time will tell if they last.I’ve owned several Suncast bins in the past that last 5+ years. Only time will tell the durability on this one. It seems sturdy though so I’m hopeful.

Looks good on the front patio, bigger than I thought it would be. Needs a skinny long lock for security

This out door storge box assembled easily and seemed perfect for the first 6 months or so. Then the lid began to warp so that the edges lifted up a bit while it seated nicely in the middle.  So far no water has leaked in, and if the warping continues there will be a area on each edge in which water will be able to enter.  I am using this as a delivery box at the end of the driveway so that delivery drivers do not have to come all the way to the house, and it suits my needs well.  However if the goal were to keep out all water long term (years) this item will likely not perform.  It is my opinion that as plastic is forever, things made of plastic should be made to last a lifetime.  This item is not.

I had the same problem many complained of that the sides did not want to just snap into the base as the instrictions indicated.  But the other reviews were right. turn it upside down and use a 2x4 and rubber mallet and they do then snap right in.  Also if putting the lid on by yourself lay it on the ground with the top side down, install the hinges & lit struts on the container first, turn the container on its side so the hinges line up with the holes on the lit and attach the lid first to the hinges then to the struts put screws in all the way but not tight, when all the screws are in place flip it up and then tighten everything up to finish.  Seems like a really good storage container once you get the assembly out of the way.

The only negative is that I could not get 2 screws in. Otherwise it is a great product. It is very sturdy and despite my little hiccup assembly was a breeze. It is a great product. It should be at least 4 1/2 stars.

After a few months of having this deck box, it's pretty good to me so far. It has very good storage capacity. Its closing and locking mechanics are well made and versatile. The only things hindering this box from being perfect are that after a few months of keeping it outside, directly exposed to the elements, the lid has bent slightly due to prolonged sun exposure and its compatibility with locks is limited. That doesn't mean it doesn't protect everything inside from the outside weather as it still does that fine, even with this hiccup. As for the locking compatibility, you need a slightly smaller than your conventional padlock size to go with the locking rings on this box. Even so, it's still an overall solid deck box at the end of the day.

Easy to put together and well built. ILike the option of putting a lock on it as well. Storage space is perfect for our kids outside toys.

Easy setup, good quality, great customer service

I’m using this product to store my outdoor cushions. It is very sturdy and the lid opens easily

This was a giant pain to build. It didn't want to snap together..ended up having to use a mallet to bang it together and dented the edge. Bought to use as a package delivery box as I get my toilet paper, paper towels and cat litter on Subscribe and save. Recently moved to the country and we have a gate and mile long drive way the USPS won't deliver to our door because it's too long so I needed something water proof, big enough to hold Subscribe orders and easy for delivery people to use.Has a place where you could lock it if you wanted. I added stick on hooks inside for when I need to leave paperwork for the my employees to pick up.I plan to place a large empty box inside so delivery can put small packages on top of it to make it easier to reach. I'm 5'2" and can't reach the bottom. My son is 5'9" and has no issues reaching the bottom.

The size is great for long bench cushions. It can hold so much and looks sturdy. The only issue was that the lid got severely warped within a few months. The screws got detached from the lid. I contacted the customer service of the company and they were highly responsive and helpful. Since they did not have a lid available for shipment, they offered a full refund. Special thanks to Yuumi for great customer service. If they improve the lid design, I would buy from them again.

Pros:- sturdy in comparison to other brands- quick assembly- nice looking- big storage dividerCons:- latch on cover does not line up with body unless you direct it- assembly of sides to bottom needed warming with a heat gun to get them to snap in (summer temps may alleviate this)- one insert for screw was not secured. We glued all 6 of them which was not a big deal.

The inside has stayed dry, though it is not "in the open".  It is sturdy, I sat on it and it held up well.  Very easy to assemble. A second pair of hands makes putting the lid on very easy. It could be done by one person but two makes it so much easier.  Spacious interior serves our needs.

I gave a four only because of the instructions, The written instructions are missing a very important step. If you don’t want to struggle, then I suggest watching it. Many reviews sounded as they were as frustrated as we were. Why the company doesn’t change the instructions or include this video when purchasing is beyond me! They said they would but who knows why they let it go on as long as they have.The deck box is very sturdy and easy to install if you follow the video.

This box does not assemble like their other boxes and the instructions included act like the sides just 'click' in like the other boxes do.  I spent several frustrating hours back and forth trying to get this to just 'click' together as per the included instructions.I finally did a search on the internet and found a video showing how to put this box together:https://www.amazon.com/vdp/03423ab1d60448dd8411b6b4c44f3a41?Once I saw this, then it really did only take a few minutes to put together.  Please change your instructions!!The box is big and feels sturdy, but it did come with one of the corners already ripped (see photo). However, due to the size, I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of trying to exchange it so I just kept it as is.I also sprayed some Flex Seal around the inside bottom edges to keep bugs and water out.

This provided the large capacity we were looking for. It appears to be solid in construction, but assembling it is a bit of a challenge and it seems like there is definitely a better way to improve upon that aspect of it. I had my adult son help by leaning with full weight down on a panel while I was on the inside pounding fairly hard on a short, angled 2x4 at the base with a rubber mallet to get the inserts to click into place. One noticeable design flaw is the lid is a bit concave so a wide expanse of water can pool on top after every rain which, if left, could cause discoloration or other issues over time.

Purchased the YITAHOME XXL 230 Gallon Large Deck Box in Brown. The deck box is large enough to hold all of our patio cushions (8) and pool floats and it looks great out on our patio. It was also very easy to put together.Giving it four stars only because we did have an issue with the lid not closing properly after some use. When we contacted YITAHOME, they were extremely responsive, great to work with (thank you YUUMI) and quick to assist to ensure our satisfaction.

Box is well constructed and sturdy.  I thought hinging side panels to front and rear panels was a good idea.  However, I found it somewhat difficult to assemble.  According to instructions the male tabs on bottom of the side panels, were to simply "snap" into slots on bottom panel.  In my case, it required tapping on top of side panels with a rubber mallet and eventually a dead blow mallet to get them to seat properly on bottom.  Once assembled I'm very happy with box, which has sturdy closures on both ends to simply operation.

This was easy to assemble and it has a great amount of room inside!

This has a great storage capacity.  We have it on our patio.  My only complaint is the top of the storage unit worps a little with the warm and cold weather.  I just hope our cushions stay dry.

I bought this item to store seat cushions over the winter. It wasn't until the summer when I was using the cushions that I noticed a problem I contacted their customer service by email and sent photos and they immediately solved the problem to my satisfaction.

90 gal white - This is a durable, easy to assemble, nice looking box. I ordered the white but it looks light gray. (Pictured) I didn’t want to send back because I need it. Just wished it was really white : (

Good value for the price. Easy to assemble.

Purchased this as our storage fees continue to climb.  This is a perfect fit for our needs.  Not sure about waterproofing (hope it totally is).  Would highly recommend. Update:  The container is not fully waterproof.  Driving rains did access the container on the bottom.  Would I purchase again?  Absolutely.  It fully met my expectations.

This box is very well made and looks good. My only complaint is the comment in the description that says easy assembly with 2 people in 7 minutes. It took us over an hour to get this thing together because the sides would not snap into the bottom. I struggled for quite awhile. I finally had to turn the box upside down and hit the bottom with a rubber mallet to get the sides to snap into the slots on the bottom. Also, to get the top on, it took 3 people. 1 on each end of the top and 1 person to screw in the lift hardware.

i had trouble attaching one of the hinges to hold the lid open.  I finally realized that the hinge was installed upside down to the actuator.

This unit is sturdy, and feels strong. My biggest issue was assembly was not accurate. A tip I found online was to flip the walls upside down and hammer (Use a towel to soften the blow) the base into the sides. That worked a lot better than trying to snap them into place which didn't work at all.Assembly aside, it is definitely solid and looks nice. The front wall does seem to be bowing out a bit, but I think I can fix that. I got the largest size considering I have a large couch with cushions. Overall, if you need the space for cushions, this will be a fine option.

Container is very nice. Good quality and will hold a lot of items. Assembling the container was a pain. The sides do not snap-in, we have to get a mallet and wedge them into place. Besides assembly we are pleased!

This storage box is truly the size to store patio cushions. Attractive and a good “value” for the cost. In a perfect world it would have either a sturdier frame and lid to tightly close. We have ours under a roof and out of the sun where it is protected. I’d buy it again after using it for 30 days.

It arrived on time and in good condition. It was relatively easy to assemble - no parts were missing. Design is good. Overall pleased with product.

Works well for storage on our deck saves a lot trips to get item for the deck.  Cushions, blowers, etc.

Looks, storage capacity , functionality

This a a pretty big storage box and will hold a variety of things.  It seems well made and came quickly.  There were no instructions on how to put it together but it wasn't difficult once you looked at the pieces.  Two people make it easier to put it together as the lid is big and you need one person holding it while screwing the hinges to it.  Seems like it will be water proof and is heavy enough not to blow around in a normal to heavier wind.  Would recommend.

It was easy to assemble and had lots of space to store cornhole boards.

First of all,  I was able to build myself without any help! The snap in walls were a little difficult. I turned it up side down to hammered in with large t-shirt wrapped around a heavy hammer and eventually slammed the whole thing down on ground. It worked! The rest of it was pretty simple. I love how it made all my seat cushions and yard stuff organized and makes my yard look nicer

Perfect for cushions and pillows! Huge!!!

First item had an alignment issue with lid, company sent another one to remedy the situation. Great support thanks.

Purchased this very large deck box to hide our pool solar cover when not in use.  We are extremely happy with it!  Looks nice and the solar cover fits perfectly inside.  Wish we would have bought this YEARS ago!!

This is huge.  But is what I needed and keeps the water out well.

I ordered this box and it came with damaged packaging which meant it was missing some parts.  My only option with Amazon was to return the box, which would have been a hassle and waste (I already had it mostly assembed before noticing that one of the hardware packets were missing).  I reached out to the maufacturer and they tooke care of the issue directly.The box is well made and was relatively easy to assemble.  The box is heavy, I am almost 60 and, although it was clumbsy, I was able to move the pacakged box myself and assemble the box myself.  There are a couple of steps of attaching the lid hinges and hydrolics that would be much easier with two people, but managable with 1.  Total assembly time was ~30 minutes.I would not expect the box to be waterproff in standing water more than about 1/4 inch deep.  The design does make it pretty water resistent in even heavy rain.  If you don't put something in the locking mechanism (I am just using a bolt as I don't need it to be secure) the lid can open in heavy wind.Overall a solid product.

I love but it does have cheap plastic hinges. Otherwise it's pretty perfect.

Recently purchased outdoor furniture for my deck. Didn't want to have to drag cushions in the house nightly.Was able to treat myself with this storage unit, so glad I did. LoopMy son was able to put it together in about 30 min.Looks nice, sturdy and very roomy. Can even be used for seating.

Pool toys

Very easy to assemble. Start with it upside down so you don't have to flip it to snap in the bottom. Larger than expected but fits the patio cushions perfectly. The divider is nice and we'll likely keep stuff like lantern oil and citronella candles on that side.

I bought this to store a Honda water pump, fire hose and a gas can in near our dock. We have a community association volunteer fire fighting group and everything has to be available when ever a call goes out. I let my nieces put it together and they had no problems. It's just big enough and keeps everything together and dry. I put a small D-ring on the latch to make sure it stays closed in any wind. We had a severe storm blow up yesterday and to box works perfectly.

We use it on our boat. Works great…easy to put together. Water proof.

Assembly was relatively easy. It has made our life so much easier. Instead of dragging all of our stuff on the pool deck into the house, we just load up the box and are done cleaning up. We are very satisfied.

Works great to put our pool rafts and toys in it

I had order another brand of one of these a few years back but I have to say the quality of this brand is excellent.  I bought this one for my daugher and put it together for her.  It was a breeze even for me as a senior citizen to assembly!

When you have a big patio set this is the box for you!

Fits all of our huge pool floats in it. Great price for what you get. Very sturdy doesn’t take long to put together. Quick tip when putting side on flip it to where the side are on the floor and the bottom part is up in air take rubber foam that comes in box and a mallet to click the sides pieces in quicker and easier. Make sure to hit mallet on the rubber not the box it self.

Great quality. Easy to assemble. Definitely recommend

Purchased to store a small bounce house. Everything fits fine the blower.  The box looks great on the deck and was very easy to put together. I highly recommend.

Seems sturdy, easy to assemble. Hold LOTS!

Exactly what I needed to store my patio cushions thank you

The directions call for a second person to help. I did it myself but with a little time consuming. Feels strong and it only takes the screws it came with to put together. It came with decent screw driver. I used my own. I will be using it for storage of fake Ivy I have hanging fence. This will be for winter storage. I think it is worth it so much I bought a 2nd one for use of all outdoor yard decorations.

Ice and big

Amazing company with superior easy to assemble products.  Great customer service and follow through.  Highly recommend this item.  It’s huge.

YITAHOME 260 Gallon Extra Large Deck Box is perfect for my deck. I can store chairs, covers, and deck umbrella inside it. It looks good and gives me gallons of space to store my deck furniture. Only one drawback, putting it together alone is not feasible. You need a second pair of hands to build it for the cover. I ordered a second one for inside this time as clothing storage. Good buy for storage.

I needed my girlfriend to help me put this together, because she is better at that stuff then I. Took a little figuring out, but it went together and it's big enough to store a body, I mean pillows from your deck, I have 14. I also had to have a place to put my wildbird seed, so squirrels won't get it. It's a great size and easy to move.

"We are thrilled with our new Yitahome deck box. We needed an extra large size because of the cushions for our outdoor couch and this box works out great. The size, design and color are great and an extra bonus is that we will be able to use the top as a food serving area when we have guests over. Really nice!We had an issue with our installation and contacted the company. Can’t say enough about their customer service! We heard back from them within 24 hours and they were fantastic and worked with us to completely solve our issue. Couldn’t be happier - definitely recommend the deck box and the company!"

We needed a storage unit to house our outdoor sofa cushions to protect them from tree pollen, leaves, squirrels and rather large Texas lizards that like to eat them.  This product seemed perfect.  Very sturdy and weatherproof.  It was also offered at a great price.  As a large item, it came via a different carrier than most Amazon packages, but it arrived promptly and without any damage.  Turns out, it was much larger than I expected, which was my mistake as the dimensions are clearly stated in the product description.Though we ended up not needing this unit, the team that handled our return request responded promptly and we were able to come to a very fair resolution for this rather large and heavy return request.

Loved it!  Was the perfect size for my cushions.

This box is big enough to store all of my cushions and pillows for my 9 piece patio set, plus some room to spare if I squished stuff down. It's a huge box!Easy to put together. I slid the sides together first, flipping it upside down and putting the bottom on and pushing dowm to snap the tabs in. I had a hard time doing it the "right" way.Had an issue with my delivery and the customer service team was responsive, helpful and sent replacement super quick. Would buy from them again! Thanks!

I was worried because of some of the reviews but I got it and let it sit through a harsh winter in the woods before I reviewed. You can see how much snow I got but still everything was perfectly dry inside not a drop of melted water! I think it’s excellent value and fits snug with a soft open/close lid .. take time in building it right and it shouldn’t leak. You can sit on it too it’s very solid. My only advice is if you have a little sitting water from rain on top wipe it off first because when you open the lid a little will drip in as it opens but it’s a small thing considering the quality and price. I’m waiting for them to come back in stock as I ordered the 90 but might treat myself to the bigger one since it’s only sale and only about 25 more! I highly recommendIt’s got some dirt on it from the winter but easily wipes off and looks brand new when I clean it but wanted to show you after a hard storm how it held up

The product initially came slightly damaged during shipping. Audrey in customer service addressed the problem and shipped the replacement very quickly. The product was very easy to install, was designed excellently, and was a perfect solution for my requirement. I was very happy with their customer service.

Perfect size for all our patio cushions. It looks great too!

I purchased a YitaHome deck box for it's great quality.  The deck box definitely has quality and has a great look too!  I had an issue with a piece damaged by the shipper.  YitaHome's customer service was excellent in working through the issue with me.  I would highly recommend their products and their priority in making sure their customers are happy.

I love the size, the ease of assembly, the durable construction, the way it blends with my patio furnishings without looking overwhelming. The price was great but the value of what it cost is immeasurable. It can seat two more people when we are outdoors because it’s a great seating height and very strong, it also stores maintenance equipment we use for the little yard and flowerbeds. I do love it and I’m glad I took the time to find just the right piece to complete my outdoor area. I am very pleased. Although two people are recommended; my handyman did it alone in just a few minutes.

it's a good product, but the installation menu needs improvement. I had to google and checked the previous review to find the correct way to install it. Please update the installation procedure on user menu.

Able to store all our beach stuff in

We ordered this storage box to hold all the cushions we have for outdoor furniture.  The dimensions specified are exact and everything we planned fit in there perfectly.  The divider that comes with it makes it perfect for different sized things.  When we got the first one the lid was damaged by the shipping company.  We reached out and Amy responded right away and within a few days we had a replacement without any troubles.  It was great to have a good quality product and such great customer service.  I would highly recommend.

The box was of very good quality and size. I did however have an issue with a defect on the box. My issue was promptly responded to through the customer service information they provide with the product. The issue was quickly resolved to my satisfaction. I would recommend.

This came damaged and the company was great about making it right. I’m sure it was FedEx who stuck the fork from a fork lift into the side of the box damaging the plastic bottom. Other than that, the deck box is made very strong. It was easy to put together. I recommend this company because of the customer service is great. It’s waterproof too.

well made, easy to assemble, stands up well to rain, you can rest assured your items will stay dry.  You can add a lock.  Well worth the money!

This was easy to put together and seems pretty durable. I highly recommend using a power driver and 2 people.

I bought the 260 gallon box to accommodate all my patio pillows and they fit perfectly.  Sturdy, spacious and well made. All pieces were included, also liked free shipping.

We ordered this box because our packages got stolen. We opted for this one because of overall decent reviews and speed of delivery compared to other sellers. Retrospectively, this was our worst decision, because it is not worth it. It is fairly lightweight, it does not feel sturdy. It requires purchase of a separate lock, but it was difficult to find a lock that would fit through the whole (it needs to be fairly skinny). We ended up finding one also from Amazon, but unfortunately, it requires an unusual sliding motion to be opened, which leads to the majority of couriers (including many Amazon couriers) leaving packages behind the box or by the door, which defeats the purpose of even having it. Additionally, it is fairly difficult to open, so even when a courier makes an effort to open it, they grab it by the "deliveries" sign which pops off every time, and we are too tired of this to keep putting it back in. This is our only purchase from Amazon on which we have so many regrets about buying it, and it feels like a huge waste of money. We are happy for those whom it works for, but for us, it ended up being a waste of 100$.

UPDATE on 3/17/24 from 3 stars to 1 star: Now that it's been outside for a few months, it's even moreso contorted. It is difficult to close the door now and there is a gap at the bottomCons: Water drips inside easily. And the door doesn't stay flush when closed (the top of the door sticks out a little). Now I have to figure out how to rig something so water doesn't get inside. It's also not sturdy enough to caulk the back corners because movement will crack the caulk.Pros: Even if my packages get a little wet from rain due to water intrusion, it's still much better than having them sit in the rain. It's large and it's not too expensive.This was a waste of money and time. In this case... you certainly get what you pay for.

Was great for a while but fell apart after 6 months. I cannot get the sides to clip into the base anymore. Additionally anyone with a brain can just slide the top off and access any packages.

This was the biggest waste of $ ever. It falls down when the wind blows and won’t stay together: the parts don’t go back together if you have to reassemble. Get a chest type box instead - this one is not where it’s at.

Smells like it sat in a smoke shop for a year then they decided to sell it doesn’t lock in place and there’s huge gaps everywhere. Would not recommend

Originally was pleased, but over time the plastic warped. The unit needs better handle to open (when assembled)  the grooves in the molded handles are not deep and you cannot open.  I bought a small handle and attached it so the door opens more easily.  Over time the warping caused the tabs to separate and the unit was blown across the yard.6 Month Update.  Do Not Buy!  Complete garbage.  Sides no longer stay attached to the base.  Its going in the trash.

The box looks great and is easy to assemble, however it doesn’t stay together at all. If your package weighs a little bit then the box falls apart. Our anchors also broke off right away so we had to look for alternate ways to tie it down. Don’t waste your money on this box.

Fell apart and broke after 1 month of use outdoors

Purchased on sale, just under $70, and well worth it. Perhaps not the sturdiest thing available, but easy to assemble and seems like it will protect packages from the weather. My husband made a small concrete pad to bolt it to. My only gripe is that you can't anchor it on all four corners.

I am on the shorter side and was struggling with my existing package box as I had to reach way inside to get packages off the bottom and could barely reach them. This is a very large package box so make sure it will fit in your space. It was a bit hard to open the door so we installed a cabinet pull (does not come with the box) and now works great. The box is sturdy but not super heavy duty.

The hole for the lock is too small!! The box is flimsy…Some drivers from Amazon don’t even fallow instructions and leave packages on the open in front of door . Those are stolen of course!! The box is right next to the door… go figure the excuse for not using the box….

I did not purchase this for its intended purpose - preventing porch piracy - so, I cannot speak to it on a security level. I purchased it for vertical storage in my garage - it easily fit all of my beach/camping chairs. Its a nice material, like those more expensive storage containers from the home goods stores, and it was super easy to assemble (though the directions do say it cannot be unassembled, which makes sense as a security feature) - it even came with a screwdriver! I was skeptical since there were no reviews at the time I bought it, but I'm glad I made the purchase anyway. Its perfect for my needs.

Easy to assemble and came with everything to put it together with except the rubber mallet and that’s understandable!! I ordered a sign to go with it so the delivery services will see it better.

It is all plastic and it doesn't look durable. It is cute and functional, but I feel like that's going to break soon

My dog pinch the mailman in the inner leg. I’m an Amazon flex driver. I seen these out on the road and used them. So I bought one put it at the end of my driveway. Now I don’t have to worry about drivers getting nipped by my dog. Mailman make her nervous because they were fast. She doesn’t like people running in and out. She is six years old and that was the first time she’s ever done that. So to protect me, I bought one. It is dirty, but I put a paver in the bottom of it . I will take a picture of it later. I recommend this product.

The door sometimes opens with the wind but other than that it keeps packages dry

I have wanted something like this for awhile for packages. When it showed up in the recommendations and the price for it, I jumped on it. Received it today and set it up. It's not as light as others have posted, but a patio brick wouldn't hurt if it's out unprotected. Mine will be on the porch with railing, so I'm not worried. The grandkids wanted to hide in it and the bottom came un-snapped and the top is friction fit. I wanted to make it hold up a long time and not planning on taking it apart anytime soon. So I added some screws to keep snaps in and hold the top. Another review said the handle is hard to open. I agree and added my own high for the delivery person. I also added a bungee cord to close the door and painted the sign to make it nicer and unique. Solid 4.5 stars, but with some screws, it's a 5 all the way.

I love the IDEA of this: someplace safe for all my packages? Sign me up! The reality isn't quite what I had hoped.It's a huge pain to assemble. The pieces don't much like to stay together once as they're assembled, and the directions aren't great. We needed to move it from our living room to the porch after assembly.  The top slid off and the bottom fell out.Once we finally had it in place (and put.back together, again,) we struggled to slide the "deliveries" sign into place. We actually had to scrape it down to make it fit! There's also not much of a handle to open the door, which is a bit of a pain as well.Overall, it does the job. It's large enough to handle our big monthly subscribe and save delivery, and it's worked well for grocery delivery, too.When I eventually need to replace it, I'll be looking for a different option.

I got this for outside my apartment door because I order from Amazon daily and was worried about the safety of my packages. The setup was quick and easy with minimal effort. It’s lightweight and was easy for me to move around. I used my power tool just to drill in the screws and the rest you just snap into place. The first day I had it up USPS actually put my packages inside without me having to tell them! Nice because it does say “deliveries” on the front which makes it easier.It’s super roomy, a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. You can definitely fit a ton of orders in it. I didn’t read the measurements but was surprised at how big it actually was. It does have a latch that you can lock while you’re away, not sure how that would work however unless you gave the delivery person a key. There’s no way to put packages in unless it’s unlocked.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I’m not sure as to the stability of it. You click the pieces into place and then basically just screw the door on, so if a lot of weight is added to it whether that be the sides or on top I’m not sure how much it could handle.

I'm often not home when my packages arrive, and while I'm not worried about them being stolen in my rural area, I'm always worried about the rain. Often I've come home to packages at my gate that are wet and soggy. Not anymore. This parcel box has made for less stress on rainy days when I know I have a bunch of packages arriving. This is not only a life saver but a mail Saver aswell!

This package delivery box is a fantastic solution to not only deter package theft, but also to keep your packages dry and protected. It was easy to assemble and looks great.  The only issue I have is that the plastic “handles” are super tiny and not convenient to grip.  You can only fit the tips of your fingers on, so it’s hard to pull the door open.  Other than that, it’s a great outdoor storage box.

good for my purpose

Nothing to dislike (so far?).I purchased it to house my electric pressure washer whose manual sternly warned me not to store it outside. The PW fits in it very nicely. The door shuts perfectly well without a lock, although I may add some sort of clip later if the door loosens up. The all-plastic construction is ideal for an item that may still drip a bit when put away.

I use it for my delivery box.I put additional screws and bolts in itIt’s under my eve. So it doesn’t get much water in itMostly keeps stuff out of view from the thieves we have these days.

Love it !, but they still  won't put in box! Lol even with a sign on it that says please place packages in side box lol

Love it

Great product.

This product is exactly as listed at a very reasonable price. Very happy with the quick assembly! We anchored it down outside of our small Office door. The Amazon and UPS drivers are using it frequently. Just remember to order the decal for the top side for UPS and Amazon and USPS to please leave packages here after hours.

I actually ordered this to Have the Amazon driver put my packages in so it keeps them out of the rain and believe it or not it really does a great job. Highly recommended.

A spacious and secure storage box for package deliveries. The lockable feature adds a sense of security, and the double-wall resin construction keeps items safe from the elements. A practical solution for porch deliveries.*This product was given to me through the Amazon Vine program for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have no affiliation with the company/seller. I hope you find this review helpful in your decision-making process. *

This storage locker or secure package locker is super awesome and exactly what we needed. One side has the word “DELIVERIES” which is perfect for deterring porch thieves. We have a home business and at times receive multiple deliveries from all the different carriers. This has already given us more freedom and more importantly,  peace of mind that our important deliveries are safe. Not to mention our miniature dachshunds who do not like people using the doorbell or knocking on the door. It pays for itself in less barking. Anyway, it has some fabulous features such as being weatherproof. We live in an area that receives weather from all four seasons and rain and snow has also been an issue for us in the past. The whole locker is made from super high quality resin. Strong and durable. Heavy duty and build to last. Was easily assembled by one person in approximately 15 minutes. Another great feature is that it has pre drilled holes on the bottom that can be used to easily secure the ground or porch or garage, where ever you may need it. Drill not included. It has a place for a combination lock; then you are able to leave the lock combination in your special delivery instructions. Lock not included. Will be using this with Amazon Key feature that allows delivery drivers to access your garage. Super spacious inside and able to accommodate a few days worth if needed. And still some space to leave your delivery drivers a treat or bottled water. Perfect. Super happy. 60 gallon capacity. Would definitely highly recommend this super useful and super high quality delivery locker. Overall, we are giving this modern and easy design ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I know this was originally meant for packages, but we have amazon key - so no need on our end. However, this is the perfect size for some of our outdoor tools! We use this to store our weed eater, blower, and mulcher (handheld, smaller one) and it fits them all with zero issues. I also contemplated using this for storage - however, you'd have to get storage totes that fit perfectly inside so you can stack them up and make the most of the room that is available.This was super easy to put together, it comes with everything you need and I was able to get it up and standing within 10 minutes. It's lasted well outdoors, and I have no worries about this lasting through the California winter.

This storage box is not just for packages.It was super easy to assemble, and keeps the rain out. The door operates smoothly, and it is easy to toss a padlock on it.I'm using the box to store a couple 5 gallon buckets and a couple bags of food for the wildlife. Bird seed, cracked corn, black oil sunflower seeds, peanuts, and dried corn on the cob for the stellar jays and squirrels, enough for everyone.The door is secure enough to keep the riff-raff out (raccoons), but if it was on a porch with packages, a person could easily get into it if they wanted. -or just pick up the whole thing and run with it.It assembles easily, keeps out the rain, it a good size for packages and critter food, keeps out raccoons, and is as strong as you would expect a plastic storage box to be, and it is easy to throw a padlock on it.

This is great to store things outside if you don't have an enclosed garage. Our "garage" is open to the elements on one side and we can't put a normal garage door on it, so we need extra protection to store some things.This is SUCH a great size to store small things in the garage, though!I will second what others said - it does need some reinforcement to stay securely together. I recommend using a mallet for assembly to ensure the pieces are tightly secured, and if you don't have anything heavy stored it in, a bag of sand or some bricks will help keep it secure to the ground.

This box is very large.  It has tons of space for even the largest packages.  Very sturdy and heavy duty.  It was super easy to put together.  The door closes tightly to keep the even most persistent rain out. I love it as I get alot of packages through the week when I'm at work. Definately a must have if you get packages.

This container was pretty easy to assemble, although I required a mallet for a bit of persuading on a couple of the snap together parts.  Assembled, it's good size and will easily hold a number of small and medium sized packages. UPS and FEDEX have been happy to use it with no delivery instructions or problems at all - I put it on the porch and the next day packages started showing up in there as expected.  It holds up to a solid downpour and keeps packages dry, so it's at the least water resistant.  Next task will be to attach it to the porch, but the size alone will deter a lot of would be pirates.  Recommended.

This delivery box was quite simple to install.  Most of the parts simple popped and or slide into place.  The only screws involved were for the door hinge.The box is large & sturdy.  It should last a long time.  The price for this product is actually on point for the quality, sturdiness & size of this storage/delivery box.

Easy to put together came with tool needed heavy resin construction seems quite durable .

Easy tonput together bit doors are not stable or secure.

I much like the ability to buy multiple units and stack them, I bought a 73 gallon and a 37 gallon and stacked them.I bought the two mid-winter, and put them outside.  The pictures show the unit can be used either inside or outside.  Worked well for 4 months.  On the first sunny hot day of the year the rolling front door completely warped - see photo.  The vendor was very responsive and gave me a full refund.If planning to use inside or outside in a shady location I would recommend.  If planning a sunny outdoor location I suggest look elsewhere.

I purchased this cabinet to sit beside my pool to hold towels, pool bag, sunscreen, etc. when we aren't swimming and to keep our cell phones, Kindles, etc., out of the sun when we're in the pool. I specifically purchased this product because the Amazon listing stated it was waterproof. Unfortunately, our first hard rain resulted in standing water inside the cabinet, and everything inside was soaked. If you are planning to use this cabinet underneath a covered porch, I think it would work pretty well. I do like the way the doors slide back out of the way.Although the product didn't work for my purposes, the seller eventually issued me a full refund. I would have preferred a waterproof cabinet, but the seller's customer service was responsive.

It is nice and not expensive, but rain goes in easily, and makes the inside unit soaked! If you intend to leave this outside, consider that!

This is a very easy product to assemble. It comes with a flathead screwdriver, which comes in very handy as all the screws are philips (?). Anything this easy to put together can't be expected to be high on durability, but overall this product seems reliable. It's an attractive product, I just have to find a use for it.

I found this storage box to be of good quality, easy to assemble and perfect for pool storage.I liked it

Nice outdoor storage! Easy to assemble! Doors move smoothly, but unfortunately they don’t feel very sturdy. The unit is lightweight and easy to move! I plan to store my outdoor cushions inside this for the winter and wet spring! Definitely would recommend!

I didn’t want a monster storage unit, just something attractive and big enough to store a few pillows and other small items.  This unit is easy to put together and looks great in the corner of the deck under the eaves.  I’ve popped a few small plants on top and its a plant stand too!  It’s pretty enough I could see it being used inside for storage as well.

The YITAHOME Outdoor Storage Cabinets are a very attractive addition to my covered rear deck. Their modular design is perfect for my application as I combined one large and one small modules.. They are extremely easy to assemble, although I recommend a small rubber mallet to help fit some of the pieces together.  I'm very happy with my purchase and recommend this product to anyone needing ourtdoor storage cabinets.

This fit the bill on what I needed for an outdoor storage unit. I needed something good, weather resistant, etc. But I also needed something small. Then I found this! Easy to assemble and get going. Make sure to follow the instructions to a T, especially with the part about the tape / sliding parts. Otherwise, you will have to re-assemble all the slats. It has been outside in the pouring rain and snow and hasn't had any issues. Using this to store my grill tools, smoking tools, and also my wood chips for the smoker. Holds quite a bit, but also allows you to put or stack other things on top of it. Very good, for what this is!

Such a great storage unit. Very happy with this in my backyard.

Easy to put together & set up; the sliding door feature is a nice touch - it allows for easy access inside & it has a LOT of room! It's more lightweight than I anticipated & 1 person can assemble it easily.

This cabinet was pretty easy to assemble and has been working well for storing cushions. It's been raining pretty heavily the past few days and everything inside is still nice and dry.The cabinet was damaged when I received it, but it seems to just be cosmetic. I covered it with some tape and it's been holding up well.

This is a good modular stackable storage cabinet. I tllioe that it has sliding doors to save space and allow for use in tighter spaces. It's durable enough to be outside, but you can certainly use it indoors too.

First, as reported by others, it's nearly impossible to assemble.  Once it's put together, it's very flexible and flimsy and so light weight that I had to put bricks in the bottom lest it blow away in a 10 mph wind.  After three days of use, I am contemplating ways to stabilize the lid that wiggles and wobbles when being opened or closed.  Not worth the expense to send it back since it wouldn't be eligible for free return as it arrived undamaged.  It's just a cheap piece that I don't imagine will hold up for more than a year, if that.  VERY disappointed in the quality - or lack thereof.  It is waterproof though, so one thing in the description was accurate.

Just spent an hour trying to put this together.  Mind you, I successfully put the larger box of the same brand together which was no easy feat.  This thing came with hard to decipher instructions....and it is not built as it states.  There is NO clicking or snapping together the pieces.  Now, I am waiting for an abled bodied friend to find time to come over and help.  It REQUIRES two able bodied people to construct.  If you do not have two able bodied people, then do not buy.  I am not even sure we will be able to get this thing to come together.  I am really disappointed.  The big box was difficult but it went together with careful following of the instructions and now it is a useful piece of deck equipment.  I am not even sure we will get this together.  I would NOT recommend this item.

It’s ok at best. When locked, you can still lift both edges up a few inches, so it’s not secure from theft and I’m not confident about water leakage. The material is strong and waterproof but the way it puts together, I’m unsure if it could keep things dry inside if outside on the porch in Florida rains. Bugs too- but that wasn't my primary concern, just no water seal. Finally, It would be better if there were st least 1/2 feet so it wasn’t completely flat  on the ground(concerning mold & water issues)So, if using for a casual deck box with some cushions or pool toys- I bet it would be awesome. Just not for my needs.

Bought two. One was fine, the second had two backs and no bottom! Called customer service over 15 times their line for service is never answered and no voice mail. Finally got someone to answer phone only to be told it was a special they did with Amz and it was their problem! Never again!

Now I know why it was returned. Product package had two sides (A1) that were exactly the same and missing side (A2) making it impossible to put together.  Side A2 has notches in the top of it so that the top will fit.  Because of missing side with notches, this product is worthless.

very unhappy with this item. the bottom part of the trunk did not snap into the sides . it is defective. the bottom falls out and it won't stay sealed. I cannot use this in my yard

The color has changed, Brown is now a distinct gray color, not brown at all.

It looked good in the pictures, but it is really thin plastic which even a child could not sit on.  It is difficult to assemble and blows away easily.  I'll never buy another one.

I purchased this for outdoor use. It was easy to assemble and had more room than I needed. I was very happy at first. Then, we had a heavy rain storm and some water did leak inside ruining one item. Now, every time I open the lid, I hear water trapped within the lid. I assume it will evaporate eventually. If you keep this indoors, say a garage or shed, then it will serve you well. However, if you intend to utilize this bin as outdoor storage and your area has heavy rain, then you could see leakage like I did.I tried to return the second one I ordered--which I ordered during storm not knowing the faults--but they wanted me to self-ship. The UPS shipping was quoted as $242. So, I kept the second bin and gave it away to a family member and ate the $300 for the bin.

Very disappointed in the quality of the storage container lid. As you can see that the pre-installed metal bar for the front of the lid is not centered and has caused the lid to crack on the edge. Have tried to reach manufacturer customer service and all you get is a recording that they are unavailable and to call back. Not a happy customer due to I'm unable to return item.

Do not under any circumstance buy this cheap, poorly designed, poor directions, very thin pieces of rubbish. I don’t expect this to survive 3 months. Pieces not marked to match poor drawings. If you buy get ready to return.

After having the storage for one month in the back yard the top corner cracked!!! DON"T waste $$.

We received product very hard to essemble..products are not labeled at all..two pieces labeled and the rest wasn’t

I was very excited about these storage bins for seasonal outdoor furniture and sand toys. We ordered these in June 2023, built them in the fall to store furniture and toys through winter. As of February, the first time opening them since fall, one of the hinges is already broken which makes opening the top really difficult. I was really hopeful for high-quality because these were really expensive. I’m pretty disappointed!

While the item looks nice? Just not durable. I bought 2 of these. Within the first year I have had issues with a few components failing. As you can see in the pictures, the edges of the tops are splitting.

We were delivered the wrong size, but didn’t realize it until the box was spread out and nearly put together. We paid for a larger size and got a smaller one. Even worse, it’s cheaply made and a total pain to put together. Purchasing this was a huge mistake.(We had made an earlier purchase - we thought from the same company- but this box was completely different. Too much trouble to figure out why the product difference or to send it back, but we couldn’t be less happy with this purchase.)

Can’t get it together! The directions, what there are, are poor at best. Pieces do not click in like the brochure says! Will never buy anything from a Chinese manufacturer ever!

NO instructions!

Plan on bleeding.

We purchased 2 of these to store pool toys and towels. We completely followed the directions that came with these outdoor storage boxes. Within less than a week one of the tops broke away from the screws that connected the top and the bottom. We have contacted the manufacturer and explained what happened. Their solutions as to what they will do to fix this problem, have been insulting and ridiculous. To say we are extremely upset is putting it mildly. These were not inexpensive items. We expected more from the manufacturer since the problem is a defect in the top itself!

Horrible item.  Several pieces were broken, and they didn't fit together.  I now have expensive pieces of plastic in a pile.

This product is made from very thin, weak plastic that is not able to protect the contents from rain and wind.

Ordered 1 unit. Tracking stated package arrived at shippers facility and then shipper said package was undeliverable. No explanation why. This is where the poor customer service comes in. When I reordered another unit, it was $30 higher in price. Amazon and Yitamore would not give me original price on my replacement when the issue was no fault of mine.I did receive the replacement several days later. The product itself is ok and I would rate a 3 star product

The lid is already starting to break around where the metal bar is. Too pricey for the quality.

Lid damaged within one week of use.

was not waterproof. had an inch of water in it after a rain storm

In the front the lid split on both sides. It doesn’t like hot and cold weather. I did like the size

Why would any mfg. pack instructions under bottom flap of packing.We didn't find instructions until we tore the box down....AFTER....it was 3/4 assembled.Instructions say....ONCE ASSEMBLED PRODUCT CAN"T BE PULLED APART......Never put together anything where the instructions weren't the first thing you saw when you opened the box.Very disappointed

the base/bottom is very clumsy and thin.The very cheap material they used, is not made out of resin, but plastic.  I know what resin is. The resin is thick and sturdy. poor quality. nice design, but I do not buy design, purchase quality and it is not cheap either

Cheap and received broken. Disappointing to wait for something like this and spend this kind of money and it’s broken. Now I have to go through the hassle of packing it back up and returning it!!!

After 2 days the lid cracked where the shocks attach. Much of the plastic rib material was broken off on arrival.  The sides are bowed out, lack of proper reinforcement in high stress areas. Not worth the price.

Heavy duty but split already. Opened maybe 10times. Very disappointed

The assembly video is extremely misleading. It is soo difficult to assemble! Every single piece is a struggle to get in place and takes a lot of strength. Also, impossible to disassemble and return..

This product is absolute garbage!!!  now I have to take an hour to take the thing apart and repackage to send  it back for a refund.  All the screws pulled out of the cheaply made lid the second time I attempted to open and close it.  No attempt to make this sturdy at all.  TRASH.

The instructions dont help make sure you don’t accidentally put pieces together wrong, and if you do they don’t come apart without damaging the product. The pieces dont line up like the instructions say they should. 0/10 recommend based on how expensive this is.

Assembly directions difficult causing taking pieces apart to reattempt to assemble which will cause damage to the deck box.

Had a week and cover is warped

2 of the pieces were defective. Problem is, once assembled, it cannot be disassembled. We have a partially  assembled deck box and no way of disassembling it for return.

Damaged

Don’t buy this. It a waste of money. I’d give it negative stars instead of 1 if I could

This deck box has high quality plastic and solid corner connections, but unfortunately that's where the goodness ends. The side walls are supposed to snap into the bottom board, but getting them to actually snap in all the way proves impossible. Using a rubber mallet to lightly tap the wall into the base board reveals the inferior construction of the wall for vertical force – the walls easily break and splinter. Because the walls are not strongly connected to the base, the entire unit is flimsy. For example, If you try to pick up the deck box (empty) and move it to another location, the walls will lift out of the base entirely and the whole thing will collapse on itselfHad they simply engineered a better way to attach the walls to the bottom board this deck box would be on its way to becoming one of the best on the market in the mid-budget category. The divider also needs to be improved so that it attaches to the walls using the same strong slide-in mechanism used by the walls when connecting at corners. This would greatly improve the overall stability and strength of the box.This could have been the perfect deck box, but poor engineering of the base and divider make it a completely non-working solution.

We are using this to store pool supplies and a garden hose.  Since we open and close this several times daily the durability is tested.  The side struts also act as hinges and both ended up broken.  Keter makes purchasing replacement parts almost impossible.  Rather than imprinting the part number on the part or having a "part lookup" web site they want the model number and the part number.  Even after I sent a picture of the part they did not respond.  Very unhappy with this box.

The colour of this item is not as stated.Tried to return but because I don't have a printer I was told I couldn't.So beware some items are not returnable

Update 2: Seller replied in a timely manner to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, because this is plastic with a reinforced frame sending me a new one would result in the same outcome because of expansion and contraction due to weather. This would be any awesome box if the box material had better expansion and contraction abilities. If kept indoors or used on a climate where the weather stayed pretty much the same it would be a great box.Update: my deck box now has a crack on the corner and the lid does not close tightly. We have not had this 2 months even. After we had our cold spell in Missouri it is now warped as well. I am extremely disappointed in this product now. Everything about size and compacity still stands but right now quality is poor. Contacted the seller so we shall see. As of right now, don't buy the box or plan on keeping it indoors, which defeats the purpose!So my husband and I built a brand new deck and we ended up buying a Polywood furniture set. So we ultimately bought this box to store cushions in. It was the perfect size for the four piece set that we purchased. To give you an idea of how many cushions we had seven seat cushions and seven back cushions and it fit all of them perfectly. It does look nice and it does seem sturdy and I know from the reviews that I read it said that you could sit on it. I am 5'6 and I tried sitting on it and my feet hung a good foot or more off the ground. So unless you're sporting 6 ft tall or more or have freakishly long legs you're probably not going to be using this as an extra seating option. I also don't know how many of these reviews get bumped to some of the other size boxes in this brand but we bought the largest one that you could buy.

When I received the product, it looked decent quality for storing pool floaties and toys etc .. just noticed yesterday that the metal slider on the closing lid (towards the front) came off .. lid was just opened and closed normally but the plastic screw slot broke off. Also the lid warped from the sides and doesn’t provide a proper close without applying pressure on both sides .. overall, it’s not a good value for your money .. build quality could be improved.

The item arrived damaged, with the packaging already broken. I noticed the cracks after almost finishing installing. I decide not to return as it would be huge efforts to take it apart to fit into the packaging box, but still not happy it arrived cracked.

Upon opening the box, I quickly saw several loose pieces that broken off their corresponding parts. After unloading the entire box, I also discovered that several of the larger panels had cracks in the plastic. So before assembly, I had the pleasure of applying Super Glue and babysitting the repairs until the glue cured. I don't know if the repairs will last or not, but I don't think it would be very easy to replace the damaged parts, since the box is only meant to be assembled, but never disassembled. I guess I'll just hope it all stays together.Once assembled, it seems fairly sturdy. But the individual pieces all seem like cheap crap. . . I guess only time will tell how it stands up to use and the elements.

We purchased the deck box and began putting together based on the handbook, which has NO WORDS.So taking it from the front, I snapped together the major pieces, based on a picture on page 5.However, when I turned the page, I saw that there were other parts, not shown on page 5 that should have been assembled BEFORE the major pieces were snapped together.I got on chat with support, and he didn't speak English well, but tried to help me, and after about 30 minutes, told me to that he didn't have an answer.  So I called the phone number, but it went to voicemail. I then wrote out a very detailed email and sent it in, never to hear back from the email. I waited a few days for the never-arriving email, and then called the support line again. This time, the gentleman was very helpful and told me that it was a ONE TIME ASSEMBLY, and solidly put together. He told me to rubber hammer to take the parts apart, and if it breaks then to return it.So we followed his directions, using the hammer and a screw driver, we were able to pound the pieces apart and continued to re-assemble it.We had trouble with the hinges on the lid. The pictures were unclear. We tried installing them two different ways, and never got them to work, so we left them out.  :)This box, now put together seems very sturdy (Unsure about the lid!) We hope that it will meet our needs well. It is very sturdy.We had initially wanted to purchase two, but after this experience, we want to purchase one, already assembled, from a local store.... to save my stress level! LOL

I bought this box for package delivery and the size it’s great. However, the main reason I got a box is because I don’t have a dry area for packages to be delivered to. The very first rain we had there was water all over the bottom of the box and the package bottoms were soaked!! Not an improvement in the situation!It’s also so lightweight that the wind blows it around on the patio… it’s pretty flimsy compared to a Suncast box. (Suncast doesn’t have the size I wanted or I would have bought one of those.) If I can figure out how to get it apart I will be returning this box and buying a Suncast even if it is too large.

We returned this because it was to small. Never used, box was perfect and returned the same as delivered. They do not give a full refund. Kept 5.00 for no reason.  Just FYI if you plan to return

Bought this to store the garden hose and sprinkler, etc in my back yard.  Bought one from a different manufacturer and was very pleased,  had to go with this one in order to get the rightcolor.  Very disappointed in how flimsy the material is

I purchased this to store my patio cushions in on the back porch. 2 stars only because it is definitely nice looking, though thinner plastic than I imagined. I haven’t tried sitting on it, but I don’t trust the sturdiness so I won’t attempt. The dimensions are slightly smaller than advertised (round down to the nearest inch), which was annoying since I had purposely measured the cushions to get a container to fit exactly. It’s a pain to put together and while I did it myself, I suggest having 2 people so one person can hold the pieces together while the other snaps them together. Finally, the corner of the top piece came bent. This means I’m sure to get water inside the container when it rains. Overall, I would not purchase again.

Nice looking container and love the net attachment but the bottom will not stay connected to the side panels so I would not recommend buying it

Box is somewhat study and spacious, but seems overpriced for the warped molded plastic. Quality control doesn’t seem to be a thing with this manufacturer. Lid has a hole and multiple cracks or broken pieces. Shipping box was not damaged and the broken pieces weren’t in the box. So it was damaged before it was even shipped and they still decided to package it up.

We ordered this to match our deck and store our patio furniture cushions while not being used. This is a simple plastic box. Definitely not worth the price tag. I feel that a sterilize plastic storage tote from walmart is about the same quality. We were also missing three pieces needed to assemble it.

The cover doesn’t close and the product is not durable. Very flimsy. It will serve its purpose, but I wouldn’t buy another one.

Delivered early and already put together.! Took an hour to assemble so not bad at all.. I have a smaller one by this manufacturer but they discontinued the 150 gallon  and replaced with this one. It looked the same in the picture but the color doesn’t match :(. The only thing I would say is it is listed as waterproof but there are open gaps on the bottom so if you are in a high water area water can get in the bottom. We are storing beach towels and cushions so we may have to consider silicone to prevent water. It is very sturdy and like the hydraulics so the top doesn’t slam. I still think this is a lot of money for what is especially since it’s not waterproof but resistant which is the reason for 3 stars.

The box itself was easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough and looks good....BUT, it leaks, as-in allows water in when it rains.  It also requires perfectly level ground to sit on in order for the lid to close correctly.  Otherwise the frame of the box twists such that the latch and lid do not line up.  Even the slightest off level ground will cause the frame to twist and the lid to shut right.

This box was purchased last spring for the summer season in Chicagoland and it did the job well. It's huge, fits all of our pillows and has kept them dry.However, during the course of the summer the top warped badly on one end. It warped so far as to break off the screw in post that holds the aluminum straight edge to the top. Additionally, the straight edge was made too long and was just forced it into place during assembly. Over the winter, as the plastic shrank in the cold, both front corners split. The top still closes but but the split corners and the warped top make it more likely to leak in the rain.I cut off the straight edge about a 1/4" on either end so it doesn't press on the edges of the top anymore. I may put right angle braces on each corner and a screw down through the top to make it conform to the aluminum bar across the front edge which will make the top sit flat against the sides again.Overall, we're happy with the box, just not sure how long it will last on a sunny deck where, I'm guessing, where most people will put it.

Very flimsy...will blow off patio it's so light..no sturdy at all.

Kinda thin and cheap feeling. Will see how long it holds up. Needs a better set of assembly instructions.

We bought both 30G and the larger deck box and find both to be sturdy, attractive and if it wasn't for the installation instructions would probably give it 5 stars. We hope the manufacturer will promptly revise the installation instructions! We will describe the current problem, which would be really very easy to correct!The individual parts all have inside and outside surfaces. One would naturally assemble the parts so that their inside faces will be inside and vice versa, the outside faces would be outside as they are nicely finished.HOWEVER - what the instructions FAIL to mention is that one part (part D) cannot fit unless it is oriented in the opposite way: this part only must be installed with its outside facing inside!  I wish the instructions would have mentioned this very non-intuitive detail. This would have saved us long and frustrating installation. In fact we were ready to return the product! One such comment and a better diagram could be easily added! Another more minor issue is that the phone number provided for customer services is wrong!

This was a very nice and sturdy box.  Assembly was relatively easy.  I assembled it in early May 2023 and put it in place.  We have not moved it and it did stay outside for the winter.  (Missouri)  I am disappointed in how both sides in the corners have multiple cracks in the plastic in less than one year.  I feel that for the price this should not have happened.

It looks good and works but unfortunately it did get water in it a few times when it stormed.

So the instructions are not very good but got passed that. The side walls locking in is not that great keep coming apart but let’s see how well it does with water. I live on the water and I will have to make something to secure it because when we get flooded it could float awaySo in time I will know if it’s water proof I feel like it won’t be

I like the size of my box and color.  But this item needs an improvement.  It does not snap shut at all. The small little spot to try and put a hook or clip in for closure is very hard to use.  You need to have the same type lids as the large boxes do. they come with stable arms to hold the lip up and closes tight.  Wind can blow the small lids open and break the lid hinges.. We have a 12x6x2 inch brick sitting on ours because of this problem.

Using this to stow my Level 1 charge cord by 15 amp 115v outdoor outlet outdoors and out of the weather when not plugged in. The Level 1 charge cord was an Amazon purchase, while car's included J1772 rides in car stowage area. Less hassle than digging out "traveling" cord.Revision: dropped rating. Warped box that I thought would straighten out with sun's heat has not in about 2 months of use. Lid doesn't stay closed, pops up about an inch at the right front edge,  concerned for storage of my car charger in rainy weather. Would be otherwise perfect but this defeats some of its purpose.

It’s a little confusing to put together. We had two G2 parts and thought that they would work instead of one G1 and one G2 and currently we’re still waiting for correct parts to have a workable deck box lid. The companies been a little lax and getting back to us.

For the price I was hoping the plastic would be a little more sturdy. Feels like it can easily crack with little effort. Best to have at least two people to assemble.

Container is good EXCEPT the essential latch arrived bent and unusable. Contacted YITAHOMES customer service several times, spoke w/rep. twice. Sent the photos they requested. Only requested latch be replaced. Never heard from company again. If your item arrives damaged, I recommend you return it completely and don't request a part.

You get what you pay for. There are no brackets to support the pop in sides. All we have are pool floats in here and it stays popping out on each side at the bottom.

Finding it very difficult to put together!  You need at least 3 people to hold it in place!

The container was easy to put together and the size is huge enough to allow for all of my out door yard art over the winter, to protect it from the winds. But the walls are thin and I am not sure it will hold up to the heavy winds we get. Will have to see. I think all of these types of boxes are over priced, so this brand isn’t alone in my opinion on the price point, and this was one of the lesser priced ones. The lid has actuators that work very well and the lid itself seems sturdy. For five stars I would need it to be thicker walled, less expensive. I did also have a broken off loose piece of the product that I wasn’t able to figure out where it came from until after I had it put together. It didn’t effect the function though would have made the container better sealed had i been able to glue it in place before I had constructed it.

The assembly of this  giant storage bin is definitely not as easy or simple as the video makes it out to be.  After assembling the bin, we filled it with some garden and patio stuff.  The bottom (base) began to separate and we had to use a mallet to snap back the parts.  Unfortunately the size is not right.  Not only is it humongous, but also a total waste of space because when we fill it up the sides start to separate.Don’t know if we are doing something wrong, but if I could return it, I would go for two smaller size bins.

The box is sturdy enough. We got it to use as a delivery box and have had it a few weeks. We put a construction block in the bottom to keep it from blowing away, which works well. However, if there’s any wind at all, expect the lid to fly off and across the yard if you open the box.

Directions really did not help and not clear

2 D instruction booklet with drawn examples was very difficult to understand. Watched a youtube video at least a dozen times. You cant tell from either which way the pieces are turned. After putting together and taking apart by myself at least 6 times, I finally figured it out on my own. It goes together easily if you can figure out the process and the order that they go together!  I finally got ready to put the lid on only to discover that the aluminum brace bar for the lid wasn’t in the box!!!  Sheesh. What a pain. It actually made me angry to realize how easily it actually goes together. Printed pictures were no help and video had no verbal instructions, just music. The only useful part of the booklet was in identifying the parts and how many are SUPPOSED to be there. Count everything before you start

Wind blew the lid open and it broke the plastic hinge right off.... day 1

Reason for 3 stars is this item IS NOT EASY TO CLICK TOGETHER! I had to finally use my rubber mallet and watch video twice…..but easier to assemble by clicking B into D and the click  each side C to D and click A next , flip over and click final piece E…I suggest using rubber mallet gently around when completed.  I will say the storage box sturdy, waterproof and served the purpose for being purchased,however, I wouldn’t purchase same item or similar from this company again due to fact constructing it isn’t easy at all, my husband walked away from it, but I was determined to put together and I did with help from my mallet,lol!

One of the hinges doesn’t work and I have to wait 5-6 weeks for a replacement. It seems strong and no water has entered the unit with all the rains we have had.It occupies a lot of space on the porch and I can’t tell if it is too big for the cushions of the sofa and two chairs since I hesitate to open the lid until the hinge arrives.

So this is more gray than white.my house is white and black and this is a very grayish white. Otherwise I basically put together myself and only needed help with lining up the lid. I would have given5 stars if it was truly white

I hope I can get a refund. The loops for a padlock easily snapped off, now I can’t lock it. Dissatisfied.

This thing is huge!!! Unfortunately we are missing part "E" and I cannot get through to the seller or Amazon to ask that a replacement part be provided.

Box is very useful for deliveries and outside storage, but very light weight plastic that pops together. Instructions poor, basically pictures which are not clear. Put one together wrong and couldn't get apart. fits together well, but can't get it unlocked. Not waterproof.

I've put together many things like this, but this was a beast. The instructions aren't really very helpful. Hint:  take a very good look at pieces C & D and look for the little tiny tabs that match up with the slots. And note that the "D" goes on the INSIDE of the box. You'll save yourself a lot of swearing! 🤬

the directions to build are not good and takes awhile to assemble

Assembly was not easy. Need 2 people and if you make a mistake disassemble is even harder.

This is a cheap box but gets the job done

Took 3 hours for 2 people to assemble. Well built and sturdy.

The size and look are nice, but the way the lid opens and the hinges are poorly designed so any wind will rip the hinges off the plastic top making the entire unit unusable.  They need to reinforce the way the hinge works and connects to both ends

Missing a bottom  but did get lids

Shocks are very weak considering the weight of the lid

Not worth the fifty pounds I paid for it

Bought this for our deck to store our patio cushions and things in.  Wanted something large enough to hold alot and be waterproof as we live in a fairly rainy area.I would say it isn't 'difficult' to put together, you could certainly do it with one person, though two makes it easier.  Just go slow, make sure things are aligned and follow the directions.  A rubber mallet certainly came in handy.Once its assembled it is very very sturdy.  My kids can climb all over it and in it with no issues.  The pneumatic hinges make opening and closing the lid easy as can be.About the weather proofing.  The lid certainly closes and keeps rain out.  However the big isn't sealed tightly shut. Because of the fact that it is plastic panels snapped together, there are naturally small gaps here and there, particularly around the base and underside.  If you have adequate drainage under and around it, no issues, but water could conceivably seep in.  And bugs can certainly find their way in, but if u are just looking for something to keep the rain at bay and keep things generally dry, this works great.All things considered, I think its a great value for the money and would buy one again.  I can see it lasting a long long time.

Very easy to put together on a firm surface.  Seems well made, and will store miscellaneous patio/deck items well. Time will tell if it is waterproof.

Ideal for BBQ and it doesn't leak when it rains so for 25 bucks, the value is good.

This deck box is big enough to hold outdoor equipment and furniture cushions. It took two of us to put it together, but the instructions were clear and easy to follow. The two long side pieces were slightly bowed but it seems to be fine now that it’s together.

Only con i can think of is that be careful when assembling - the plastic corners / plugs might break easily during the assembling if you paired it with the wrong side, also if you do plug the wrong side its hard to remove, I had to use a flat head screwdriver, thankfully the one broken plug did not affect the integrity of the box.

We are using this for postal delivery and it’s the perfect size! Waterproof! Assembly was quick. Lid is a bit wobbly but does close tightly.

The lid hinges could be better.  A screw stripped and I had to put a bigger screw in.

Perfect example of why you wait to leave reviews. We purchased the YITAHOME XXL 230 Gallon Large Outdoor Storage Box on May 4, 2023. Early March 2024 (after Winter) we discovered one of the corners had a blow out. After reading some of the other reviews we discovered this is a common issue with this product that costumer service has had to deal with. In some cases they sent a replacement. NOT in our case. They replied as follows:Sorry for this issue, but we currently do not have this lid in stock and the warehouse doesn't allow us to split other items. How about we refund you 55$ to try to fix it locally? Is that okay for you? Look forward to your reply.My reply back was a follows.Its apparent that your company is allowing a defective product to be manufactured. This defect should be recalled. After reading costumer feedback and reviews i find this to be a common issue with this box.  I'm asking for a refund or full replacement.  As $55 is not nearly enough to fulfill repair costs in this economy. The time and inconvenience of searching , setting up a repair solution is very costly.Do Better please.Thank you.As of 3/5/24 8:20 am CST still waiting for a response.Update 3/6/24. Seller offered a full refund or replacement. we elected for the replacement box. +1 starr added. Will update my review after it arrives safely.Update 3/15/24 New box arrived safely, Assembly went quickly, I cut about 1/8 - 3/16 off each end of the upper lid support bar in hopes of this defect never happens again. +1/2 starr.

But when it was finally assembled it is a great storage box for all your patio essentials!. Very roomy!

Looks great but the hinges are sometimes temperamental. One sticks and is harder to shut.Definitely need 2 people to put together as the prices are long and hard to hold in place while securing.

I received my box 2 days ago and was eager to assemble it and get it out onto my deck for storage.  However, assembly would have been MUCH less frustrating if this one tip was included: When pushing the side slots together, get the smaller ones on a side panel done first, then it is much easier to snap in the others.  I was just about ready to return it and then tried this method.  After that, it was a snap!  I really like the light brown color.

The assembly requires 2 people. The instructions are a bit vague. The 6 major parts “snap” together.  The screws are only used for the top hinges and the locking hinges.

Top seems flimsy on opening. Will have to see if it’s waterproof

**05/29/24 Update: After working with the seller via Amazon, we were able to reach an agreement and I have updated my rating to 4-stars.Generally love this! The only reason I’m giving it a 2 star is because some pieces were broken during shipping. I’ve reached out to the company customer service team with no response. But for the issues I’d give this a 4 or 5 star!

Just the size and storage that was needed for a deck dinette cushion set. Also use as a side table.  Sturdy construction, the west winds dont move it.  Pleased with the purchase as it did what was needed.

My biggest complaint is that the cover doesn’t close tight. It took a few hours to assemble, but would be helpful to have an extra pair of hands. It’s not as sturdy as I’d hoped, but it is sufficient to store cushions, and it looks nice.

The instructions were pretty clear from start to finish.  There were a couple small parts that should have been packaged, but we found them mingled randomly in the box.  2 person job for sure, easily done in less than an hour.  Just built last week, won’t comment on waterproof but made it through a couple rain showers in good shape.

Easy too assemble.Vary sturdy.

Very easy to assemble and sturdy. Exactly what I was hoping for. A little pricey though.

Super sturdy! Easy to put together.Very happy.Arrived with a broken piece but seller made it right and sent a replacement

Deck box  assembled very easy per instructions. Seams on front corners don't fit as nice as expected.

The lid wasn’t aligning correctly when closing. I contacted customer service and they were quick to respond and very helpful.

the lid hinge is already rusted

Easy 15 min assembly. Use a powered screwdriver as has 40+ screws.

I would buy another one. Easy to put together.  Nice and sturdy.

Putting together was challenging! Using for porch storage.

This box is the perfect size for a couple nights worth of wood.  Box isn’t too big for patio fire pit.  Not the most sturdy but will do the job if careful with the wood.

We bought this storage bin for storing our holiday & Halloween decorations which works well for our purpose. However, the color description and product photo are very misleading. We spent more money to choose this “black and white” bin, but it is “black and GREY” for sure. We are still happy with the purchase overall, because it’s functional and this grey color looks fine & acceptable.

Needs to be slightly bigger. Doesn’t stay closed. Otherwise went together easy and seems sturdy.

This is a good economical choice. I bought 2 boxes and have had them for about a month. They were easy to assemble; just make sure everything completely clicks into place. So far they have been waterproof, even in strong storms. They have served as storage for throw pillows and grill covers and as extra tables. The only slight drawback is the plastic is a bit thin.

It is very huge and sturdy. I am using it for something other than patio furniture and it will definitely work for my specific use. Only thing I don't like is that it does not have wheels to move around. Gave it four stars for that reason.

I hate to review something before I have used it a while but this was easy to put together and is easy to move around.  I hope it stands up to long term use.  Due to is size -really big and roomy- it is a little less stable than I thought it would be.  Not good for sitting on but will make a nice place to put food for buffet type lunch.  As long as I don't try moving it a lot, I think it will be fine.

I love bad photoshopped images. The one for this product is misleading. It has a guy sitting on the corner of the box  However on the bottom of the lid is a do not sit on symbol (see photo). Putting it together was pretty easy. I did it by myself, but 2 would have made it easier. The ground wasn’t totally even so the lid wouldn’t close properly. I put a piece of wood in the corner and now it closes perfect. It is really big.Fed ex beat the crap out of the box. I’m surprised nothing was damaged or missing. But it was all there.

Got 2 of these. One lid broke after a few days. Ask for a replacement lid but they were unable to provide one. They refunded the full purchase price of the box.

This is the perfect size for our pool items.  Went together pretty easily,  and the box came undamaged. Would definitely recommend.  Only thing I would like different is bigger hinges,  otherwise it's great!

This box is big, sturdy and looks great, but it’s not white. It’s a very light gray. I’ve included a photo for reference. If I would have known ahead of time I probably would have just gotten the all black one.

Smartly designed regarding assembly and easier than I had planned. Total time was about 30 minutes. Quality is fine - a bit flimsy but nothing worse than expected for the price.  It is not white and black. It is light grey and black.

It’s waterproof, to an extent. I live in the PNW and some water did get in through the winter. It’s an excellent box for your patio or balcony. But, whatever you put in there, if it’s wet when you put it in, the moisture doesn’t escape. You may have to drill some holes for water to evaporate. It’s a great box though! Lightweight, but sturdy and easy to pop together.

It's neither fancy nor particularly strong (for clarity It's not flimsy either, quite average is what I'm aiming to convey) but it works well as a low cost outdoor storage bin for things that would be clutter inside the house otherwise.

Nice sturdy deck box . Only problem is that the top lid doesn’t line up correctly to the latch to lock . Working on more adjustments. Overall satisfied with the unit . Much deeper which is why I ordered it . Delivery was on time and no damage in transit .

Great box. Lots of room. Lid closes tight. I did find the same box at Sam's Club for a lot cheaper a couple months after I bought this one.

This only took a few minutes to assemble. It was flimsier than expected, but when assembled it works fine, but was a great price. It functions as needed.

good

Put together by myself in about 15 minutes. Pretty well built but shows person sitting on box and box says do not sit.

We had a 170 qt storage container that was destroyed this past winter by falling ice. We used it to store furniture cushions. This new one fully accommodates all our cushions with room to spare. If this until will keep the mice away it will be perfect!

Nice looking on patio  first season using

Nice product. Love the size to store some extra large cushions. Little more than I wanted to spend but needed the size. Easy to put together and arrived quickly.

I bought this to keep my spa supplies organized on the porch.It holds 3 large filters, a sump pump and several containers of shock etc.I like the looks of it and seems sturdy enough.

Had plenty of space to fit all my furniture  cushions as well as 2 ottomans.

Put it together using what I thought was common sense-spent twice as long taking it apart to put the bottom in. Looks great and functions as expected

Easy to assemble. Nice size. Sometimes they put my pkgs in and sometimes not. So frustrating at times because I've had stuff stolen off my front porch by porch pirates.  The lid is a little wonky but that's ok. Pretty sturdy. I put a brick in it to give it some weight. We get a lot of storms where I live. Value for the money.

First of all, this can be assembled in around 10 minutes or even less if you realize that the pieces don't just snap together; you need to line the edges up and then basically bang the pieces together with your hands (or even a hammer). Once you realize that it requires a little "zetz" (force) to connect the sections, it's very easy. It looks good, has a good amount of space and is very reasonably priced. We use it mostly for grill-related accessories. Definitely a good purchase!

I recently purchased a seventy-five foot steel garden hose and I wanted something to store it in as I did not want a wind-up hosemobile.  This Vitahome 30-gallon deck box is the perfect alternative. This container is made out of lightweight plastic so if you're looking for something more heavy duty search on.  With the hose being heavy as it is I don't have to worry about the box taking off in the wind.  Assembly is easy.  Simply follow the instructions while snapping the letter-coded pieces together.  For a personal preference I might drill holes in the bottom corners to drain any water leaking from the hose.  Looks great too, kind of matches my siding.  I was unable to find a lock for the unit's small hole.  The one I purchased along with this from Amazon was too big and the two that I bought at my local big box store did not fit either and were returned.  Finally, the unit seems to be waterproof as advertised.  Mine sits outside by the faucet but on that side of the hose there is no gutter so the rain just bounces off the lid.  Highly recommended.

Since that’s what plenty of you might be wondering.We have our 15’ pool complete with all of the poles and a 50# sand filter with pump in ours with room on top to spare.Seems sturdy enough, the lid is a little wobbly if you open it from the corner but that’s to be expected. The gas shocks are a great feature.Basic hand tools (a screwdriver) is all that’s needed. Wife had it assembled it a matter of minutes.Looks nice, closes securely, and it holds everything we need. Can’t ask for much more.

After having a set of patio furniture cushions ruined by the Winter weather in Boston, we wanted something to store them in that was reasonably attractive. This item was just right for our needs as it is spacious enough to fit all of our cushions in the Winter and various lawn games and fire pit tools during the Summer. Building it was fairly easy with two people (one may have been tough in a few spots) and it was lightweight enough to be able to move it around until we found a good spot for it.The only thing I wish was better is the lid, but it is a minor issue. It works ok with the pneumatic hinges but if you don’t lift and close it by the center, the lid bends a bit. It has some metal bars across some of the sides for stability and it feels like if there were another one in the lid, that would keep it from bending. May not be an issue but I just don’t know how the bending would be over time, so we are trying to remember to use the middle each time.

The deck box is perfect. It's very large which is what we wanted. The deck box was easy to assemble and very well made including the hinges on the lid. You can also lock it which is nice. We have a lot of outdoor furniture with cushions so we were initially afraid that all of the cushions wouldn't fit but when we put them all in we found that we not only had room but we had room to spare. I did reach out to the company with a question and they responded very fast and went the extra mile which is normally unheard of these days.

I got these for some extra storage on our covered patio and they look and work great! While it hasn’t rained yet, I can tell these are not waterproof but since I am using these in a covered area I’m not too concerned, but something to consider when purchasing. They are extremely light, the plastic isn’t that thick which might bother some but once filled it adds some nice weight to the bin and they feel more sturdy.

I had so many baskets filled with outdoor balls, bats and play things that have now found a home in this box.  Neat, organized and looks good. Easy to out together.

I was hesitant to but a "generic" storage container, but it's great quality, sturdy and thick! It's been great!

Simple and easy and fits well in the space I needed to put it!

I LOVE IT AND ITS SUPER EASY TO INSTALL IT.

This tote holds a lot! I bought it to put all my patio cushions in, and there are several big ones and it holds them all. It also looks nice on my patio.

perfect for storing our outdoor sofa cushions and seconds as a table surface for food line (Company had to send an extra hydraulic arm hardware piece because the one we had was defective.  They sent 2 replacements just to be sure the issue was resolved.  Great!)

It was easy to assemble & it’s a good size to store some of my Garden Statues.

So easy to snap together, no screws needed. Sturdy/durable and quality for the price. It took me a few minutes to snap together.

Good box, easy enough assembly. Will work well for what it was bought for

As advertised very happy.

Outdoor storage.

Perfect fit for my deck.  Large enough to hold so many garden items.  Strong plastic and strong hinge. I shopped and compared to all avaiable and this was the best choice in size and price

Very well made, sturdy and easy to put together.

What a great addition to my porch! We love it! It is big enough to store pool towels, hats, and sunscreens. It adds charm to my porch, and it is versatile!

I was looking for a medium sized deck box for some emergency supplies.  This is exactly the right size for what I needed.  It was extremely quick and easy to assemble - all I needed was a small Phillips head screwdriver. The assembly directions say it takes two people to put this together, and that might be true for their larger deck boxes, but this 51-gallon box went together easily with just me doing the assembling. I am extremely happy with this purchase.

Deep enough and a great easy way to snap together simple anyone can do it

I came across this outdoor box and was almost immediately thinking of things I could use it for.  I've got yard tools, gardening tools, tabletop tools, etc., all in my backyard that need somewhere to be stored when not in use.  Perfect!  Then it came in...So after assembling this thing my plans changed.  We'd had a few packages delivered just close enough to the edge of our porch to get the exterior package damaged.  Nothing major, but enough of a concern to want to address it.  After assembling this outdoor box, we had our answer.  Staging on the front porch, next to the door, was easy - Even when fully assembled the box is light enough to move around by hand, yet heavy enough to not get pushed around with my leaf blower.  Once in place, we tested with the next few deliveries from Amazon -- Each one was placed gently into the box with no issues.  I even had one longer package (the box was ~ 3 ft tall) get placed into it -- Yeah, it didn't close, but the packages were all together.In this day and age, we've seen issues with package theft all over the news, YouTube, Facebook, Nextdoor, etc.  So when I was assembling this, and saw that it had the lock functionality as an option, I both smiled and frowned.  I appreciate that it's an option, but I hate to have to think about it that way.  We kept the kit but did not install it for now.Overall, this has worked out much better than expected.  As mentioned, I was going to use it to hold gardening supplies, yard tools, etc; but decided to go with this as a package holder instead.  I'm very pleased with how it turned out.Pros:- Lightweight for placement, but not so much that the wind can easily take it- Easy to assemble- Comes with a kit for adding a lock- Large capacityCons:- I have no complaints about this box.We're considering purchasing another one for my Mother-in-Law's deck (completely uncovered) so that her packages don't get damaged in the rain.

Bought this to replace an absolute piece of trash Rubbermaid version I had bought earlier this year that literally would not stay together. This assembled easily and made a satisfying audible click when a piece was firmly in place. Plenty of room and looks nice. It probably is not watertight around the base if that is a concern for you.

This storage box is ingeniously designed and packaged. Took minutes to put together and opens and closes perfectly.

Like the box, for me it was hard to put together.  Then I read the instructions.  Typical for me.

Study, worth buying..

We use this box for all of our deliveries. We live in the country and it gives delivery drivers one spot to put all of our deliveries. This is useful for us to know exactly where our deliveries are and not have to go on a hunt for them. This box is sturdy and the lid covers the sides so rain doesn't get inside. Overall, a great product!

I really like my new 150gal deck box. It looks nice, is roomy and all my cushions fit nicely. The assembly instructions were a bit confusing and I reached out to their customer service through the Amazon app. I had a problem connecting the bottom panel with the front and back panels. After going back and forth several times with their very kind and patient customer service they finally reached out to their warehouse who took actual pictures to send me. The problem, I discovered, was that the side of the bottom panel with the embossed C was pictured on the OUTSIDE of the box in the instructions, when it is supposed to be INSIDE the box after assembly. I also was trying to fit both tabs on the edge into what I thought were 2 slots in the other panel but there is only one slot for one of the two tabs to fit into. It's a little counterintuitive but it's because of the design. If you look carefully at the instructions you can see this on a tiny inset, but I was just really thrown by the C panels being upside down in the instructions. Once I got this figured out, assembly was fairly easy by myself but it would've been faster and easier with two people as others have suggested. Yitahome offered me some money back on my purchase for all the trouble and said they would address the problem with the instructions. That is excellent service. I have not had the box for long so I cannot judge its durability but I would not hesitate to buy products from them again, as I believe they would satisfactorily address any problems.

I bought this for a package box on our front porch, and assumed it would be cheap looking but do the job. I was surprised how clean and polished it looked when I finished building it. Would I recommend sitting on it? No, at 140 lbs it bends under me some. Could it be a great looking storage solution? Yes. Would buy again, highly recommend. Building took roughly 5 minutes and no tools were needed. Cat in photo for scale, he's 20lbs lol

This was well built and relatively easy to assemble. Well worth the money.

I was looking for something to put the patio furniture covers in rather than having to take the into the garage.  This is perfect.

It took us a few minutes to figure out how to connect the first three pieces together as the side pieces have the rough, carved out part on the inside, but connect with the smoother part, which is the bottom interior of the box. So the bottom inside of the box looks like the outside. This way it has a nicer interior finish. Once we figured this out, the remainder of the assembly was straight forward. We have found that this 30 gallon size is a perfect size for, functioning well and not overbearing at all. The color coordinates with our house tones too.At first I wasn't going to get a sign, but after several issues with my paper sign, sanity told me it was worth the investment, which it has been. We have a nice covered porch protected from the elements, but this deck box sits right next to our front door, easily accessible, as well as now being a convenient spot for setting my purse, bags, etc., while opening or closing the door. Plus the deck box provides an extra seat if our porch swing is already occupied.I now wonder why I didn't order this deck box sooner. So if you're on the fence regarding a this, I believe that you'll be glad you did, as it has so many practical uses and has made our life easier.

We have a lovely wooded backyard, but with it comes a large family of squirrels who make it their business to scarf food from our birdfeeders and chew through the plastic storage bins in which we store our birdfood on the deck.  My daughter who had a similar problem recommended that we consider a resin deckbox. We looked at several at Amazon, and we liked the looks and size of this one. It is not too large, it is a muted black (like Charcoal gray) and it has a wood grain texture so is a welcome and attractive addition to our relatively small deck.  So far it seems to be a successful way of storing our seed without it being detected by those pesky tree rats, thus we are happy with the product.  We would not hesitate to recommend it to others.UPDATE:  Oh well!  Apparently, I spoke too soon.  We have been away from our home on vacation for just short of a week and were sad to hear from our neighbor that the tree rats have had their way with our deck box. They chewed a substantial hole in the lid, so it seems we are back to the drawing board.

I was concerned initially because the instruction says it is a 2-person job, but I was able to put together the 51 gallon size alone using a Phillips screwdriver and mallet hammer.  So far it has protected my items from the rain.  I will update my review if I have any issues with the product.

Satisfied with the product

First let me say I purchased the last two in brown. And I couldn’t have made a better purchase. The description is as exactly as stated. My boxes came in perfect condition. The ease of putting my deck storage containers was a breeze. It took me about 30 - 40 minutes for both and that included getting them out of the boxes. . They seem sturdy. It supported my weight but I don’t know about a 300 lb person.  And I do not plan to sit on top of them. Not sure how much they will fade in the sun but everything fades to some degree. And at this point  cannot attest to the water tightness.  But they seem to be constructed to not to have any faulty henges or seams to allow water inside. That is why I rated it a four. So far I’m 110% satisfied with my purchase

This thing looks great and stores a tone of pool supplies.

Product is reasonably stable enough and cleverly engineered to use mainly the locking clips on the sides to put it  together .It’s light so can be moved by one person and It looks good so much that I had to buy a second one

Very satisfactory

One of the hinges did not work properly and they were wonderful in getting replacement parts set. Quick response to my emails and frequent follow up until everything was taken care of.

This thing is sturdy and it’s six panels were easy to snap together

This thing is awesome. I have a group furniture patio set and I can put everything in there and towels and stuff for the pool. Awesome. It’s big and it’s nice.

Bought a first one and assembled it. Decided to get another.  The second had the top panel damaged when it arrived.  It looks like the fork of a fork lift had gone through the box.  I called the customer service number from the paper in the box.  Response was awesome.  Resolution was fast and easy.  I do recommend this if you are lookig for a pool/patio storage box.

Nice box. Super easy to snap together.  No tools needed. One person job.

I was able to put it together by myself. It works for what I need. I am happy!

Love this item. Just what I needed. Got my yard tools in it. And I use it for a side table on the patio.However, the instructions putting this together was not so friendly.  But once I figured it out it was easy.Good quality,sturdy!Love it!I needed this!

Storage space for patio cushions, when it rains.

This product is pretty durable I use it in a very windy and salt water area. I cannot say it is waterproof but it serves its purpose. Easy to assemble and I like the fact that you can lift the lid on top and also open the sides like a double door.

Our ‘Big Name Brand’ trash can enclosure was being thrown around (and frequently disassembled) by residuals from hurricanes and winter winds. I decided to give this brand a try as the replacement. It scored a ‘whoah’ out of the box. This is no thin pop-together thing. The hardware is a mix of nylon/plastic and that trusty metal stuff. The the wall, floor, and lid pieces have some serious weight to them. Well beyond their predecessor. No slide & pop connectors for 1/16th thin plastic here. The pieces screw together into embedded threaded nuts and the door hinges feel pretty heavy-duty as well. Overall, very happy with this product.

We Purchased this 4 x 6 shed to use as a chicken coop. It states that it is made of resin, which is not  true, resin is a hard plastic.  This is made of cheap plastic like a garage sale sign. (See photo) It states that it has a reinforced floor, which we did not receive. Not only was it made of cheap material and not resin, it is NOT STURDY AT ALL! Many of the parts were missing screw holes, which we had to drill ourselves. Of the screw holes that  were drilled, many were misaligned. We are not idiots. We assemble things all the time we know how to read instructions, This had a ridiculous amount of parts and the instructions were somewhat confusing at times, but however we put it together correctly. Had my nephew not already started assembling it for me it would be returned because the description is very inaccurate as well as embellished. I expected it to be hard resin so I could hang the heat lamp in it during the winter time when it was very cold to keep the chickens warm, There is no way I would hang the heat lamp in this even though they don’t get extremely hot . It would probably melt it. I am sooo disappointed in the quality . One of my worse purchases from Amazon

My shipment arrived on Friday, but when I opened it this morning the lid and floor were not in there. The box did not mention 1 of 2. Contacted CS, but haven’t heard anything back. Just got another shipment and this box contained the lid & floor and the box had 2/2 listed on it!The cabinet went together pretty easy. I put it together by myself, even though it says 2 or more people. Would have been easier with someone else’s help. Took my about 45 minutes.

This was the perfect size for my gardening items. It matches perfectly with our house & trim and the best part, it was easy to assemble!

The design and materials are acceptable but the amount of work it took to put this together belies a design failure. Even though this was the cheapest option for this size the fact that it cost over $1,000 in material was exceeded by the crazy amount of time it took to put together. Not worth it.

I’ve just finished assembling the shed today. While it was easy to do, I disliked the fact that the plastic parts were not very sturdy. I couldn’t make the sides lock in properly and started gently pushing them to go further in the slots. To my surprise, the plastic started bending inwards. I had to be extra careful to not damage the plastic parts. Also I had originally bought a pretty good padlock for it. Again to my surprise, it did not fit. The hole for the lock is very short and a bit recessed into the front doors. This makes it only possible to use very tiny locks such as the luggage ones. Any decent lock won’t fit on this shed. If you’re hoping to protect the stuff you put in there from theft, think again.I do like that the shed is spacious and easy to assemble.Edit: After a day and about 3 hours in the sun, the lid started bending like a banana. Now I have to figure out how to reinforce it so it won’t bend.Do yourself a favor and get a better shed.

Got it today, went together super easy and I'm impressed with the quality for the price.  The two backs and two sides are held together with 18 nylon bolts.  The nuts are molded into the panels and the whole unit is quite sturdy.  The sides also have additional threaded nuts molded in for shelves, or other additions.  I'm using them to attach elastic cords to keep folded up lawn chairs from falling over.  Also, unlike some other brands, this has actual hinges--two for each door and two for the top.  My only minor complaints would be the locking hasp seems to get in the way, and I'll probably take it back off.  Also, the support rod to hold the top open is not super convenient.  Overall super impressed and would definitely buy again.******Been a few years, and bought another one in larger size.  Still goes together simply and everything is good.  Had an issue with a missing part and the company shipped a replace out immediately.

Its tough to put up, definitely need at least two people and it takes several hours, but worth it.

This was just what we needed for extra tools etc.

There are video instructions as well as a booklet with pictures that comes with the shed pieces.  They do not match up as far as sequence of installation.  We had 2 small pieces missing and the only way we could get these parts was to have an entire shed shipped to us (3 boxes over 100 lbs each) and then had to dig through the boxes for those parts and put them back together to return.  So is someone else getting a shed with 2 missing parts?  My husband had to redrill several metal pieces whose holes did not line up.Plastic floor is very thin and when we used a stepladder to complete one of the processes we found that the legs broke thru the floor. Only way to fix now is to install some plywood over floor to prevent further problems. Definitely would not recommend this product. Amazon was wonderful in how they have handled our problems so far. Time will tell if this product will hold up to the weather in our area.

Upside - it is exactly what I ordered, an inexpensive shed to store my generator.Downside - it is cheaply made and the top warped in the Texas heat when left in the up position.  Fortunately, it eventually went back to its original shape after a few days of being closed.  It is thin, and kinda flimsy.  Expect it to last a year or 2.

Easy to put together and offers a nice amount of space, but this thing has deteriorated so much over the mere 8 months I've had it I'm compelled to give it a poor review. The top cover has warped tremendously (presumably from weathering? I'm not sure) to the point that it does not seal shut anymore, and the foot-operated latch for the front doors has broken off. I always appreciate reviews that reveal how a product holds up over time not just the immediate first impression so this one is giving back to the community a little bit. Unfortunately, can not recommend.

We had an old plastic shed that we decided to replace with a slightly bigger one. The old shed was very sturdy with thick walls. This shed is flimsy in comparison. I’m concerned it won’t even hold the weight of snow in the winter. This was a pain in the you know what to put together. It took two of us several days of working at it for hours each day. Things didn’t always line up. The roof ridge was the worst. I suspect all sheds like this are a pain, so I don’t know if this is worse or better than others.

THE PRODUCT CAME BROKEN AND THE BACK BOARD IS CHEAP , MY GARBAGE CAN WILL NOT FIT IN THIS AT ALL . TOO SMALL . NOT LIKE DESCRIBED

This was THE HARDEST thing to put together! Took 4 people and 2 full days. The instructions barely had words on it. Pictures that made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!!! I do not reccommened getting this unless you're gonna pay someone to put it together.

Doesn't fit together well. Uses lots of screws that go into pure plastic. Flimsy when finished. Told by customer service that additional parts were "not available for sale".

The box is very misleading in the photos. It is a lot smaller than they make it appear. The measurements are accurate, however, the items the picture shows it can hold is far from true. The box does not have good structure and bows out when resting items (a shovel) against the side walls, making it difficult to close properly. Not sturdy at all. Item is very overpriced for the quality and size you receive. Would not recommend to hold yard tools/equipment.

Finally getting around to putting it together and the back panel is ridiculously insufficient for outdoor usage. Too late to return, so I will probably have to make my own back panel out of something more sturdy and weatherproof.  Wouldn’t recommend.

Top lid didn't keep It's form once put together. Front sides curved up on both right and left front exposing gaps which didn't keep rain totally out. Only took about 3 days for this to occur with the sides of the lid curving upwards about 1/2" more. Other than that is structurally sound. If in an area exposed to direct rain water might think different and go in another direction for a product.

Storage is mediocre quality at an inflated price. The images are photoshopped but I figured it would still be able to fit some of the things it suggests. I bought this just to store my lawn mower and see what else would fit with it. My lawn mower itself doesn’t fit. I should have measured but now I’m stuck with this garbage. Buyer beware.

not as sturdy as a 12 year old one that we use for wood storage in the winter

Package arrived in two separate boxes and was easy to put together. However, there were mulitable damaged parts and the quality of the product is not so great.Definitely not worth $300.

It looks very sturdy but we decided it was too big for our needs.

not sturdy

This product does not fit a mower in it without lowering the handle. Very small

I thought this would be a great deal but it really isn't. You have to have some power tools and guess where the screws should be drilled. The plastic is thinner than it should be for being an outdoor shed. It won't take much to break into this especially since the back part is just treated cardboard like the kind that serves as the back part of cheap bookshelves. The price of this is far too high for what you get. It feels like the only purpose of this is to put yard tools in to make the yard look cleaner. Maybe if this was like $100 it would be worth it but at $250, no way. It needs to have better materials, better instructions, and be designed to be easy to put together without additional tools.

1.  Directions not specific enough or detailed enough2. Plastic melted over metal pieces added extreme amount of time to remove, adding many hours to the project.3.Back side of storage has no screw to brace the back to - i.e. allowing a small bow of the pieces in hotter weather.

The quality of the shed itself is as advertised. I debated on keeping this once but had to send this item back. The problem with this brand is that you have to try and find a shelve that will fit this shed because the company does not make shelves. The price is great for what you get but not worth the money if you want shelving at all.

Great size but water gets inside of it when it rains

I like its compact. It is alright but not too sturdy.

Wanted a shed to store folding lawnmower, power washer & extra chairs. Packaged well, nice looking, simple to put together by yourself but not something for heavy duty use. Back panel is a thin plasticized version of corrugated cardboard, only suitable for against a building & easily susceptible to poking or other impact damage. If the back panel were rigid plastic like the other pieces I'd rate it higher & it would be more suitable for different locations. The size was right for my needs & will do for now. I bought it specifically for the medium hight. Did not want tall item & deck  boxes were not high enough to store what I wanted. As mentioned before, would have rated higher if back piece was rigid plastic like the others.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Fairly easy to assemble if you're used to Ikea-style instructions. One person can assemble if you use braces to help you stabilize parts as you build. It does require some strength to lock in parts. I used a mallet to gently lock in while pushing down on parts. Also, shelving can be bought from Ehhly that fits this model. (Ehhly C030-C)

It went together easily but the top warped after 2 weeks and now it’s somewhat open on two sides, which may affect water resistance. I had to buy a small cable lock to secure it because a regular sized lock will not fit. The box is a good size but I wonder how long it will last.

Item is not ready heavy duty. It not worth the money asked. It was easy  for me to put together and I really don’t put anything together. D was missing the holes and I had to make holes with a nail. My push mower handles was a tad bit too long but it’s ok. I’m not going to return it.

Looks good and assembly was easy. However the weight of items stored seems to push the bottom down causing the right-hand door to not reach the bottom lock. When empty, it is fine. I will have to take everything out to see the weight capacity and distribution.

It's got a good design, but the material is not as strong as competitors. I have another similar one (which I got at Costco) of a similar price, and the material is much more stronger. Not sure how it will withstand the Florida sun.

End result is good, however it takes two very very strong people to build. Had to hire two guys who also struggled.

Product pictures the large garbage cans provided by disposal companies but it’s much smaller than expected. I took a picture next to our other storage container for comparison. Seems sturdy just the size was disappointing.

After just 4 days outside in temperatures below 80 the corners of the lid started curling. Concerned how bad it will be when temperatures get in the upper 90's!

The box was ripped open when it arrived and we were short one door hinge. Other than that mostly everything was there. Hopefully we can get another one replace.

For the price it is not very sturdy and showed up cracked. The side walls start to bow outward when only putting patio cushions inside.

This little outdoor storage shed is pretty decent and mostly easy to assemble, but there were some hiccups and the overall sturdiness is questionable. Let's start with assembly.Assembly is mostly easy with self tapping screws and snap together pieces. The major problem I had and reason for 1 star removal, is that one of the sections on the floor piece had an extra knob of hard plastic that clearly isn't show in the instructions and shouldn't be there. There is no way to physically snap the side wall into place with this plastic piece in the way, so I had to use my oscillating tool to cut it off, while being careful not to cut off the locking tab so I could properly secure the sidewall. I have 3 pictures of this. The first is the other side that did not have this issue, then the side that DID have the issue, and the final sight after cutting the extra plastic off. Once I had it corrected I did get the sidewall to snap in place, and moved along with install. My other complain about assembly is that some parts (like the lid latch) are both labelled incorrectly (supposed to be part T, was labelled L) and was physically different than the instructions. Luckily, it was the only part that looked anything like what was needed so we made it work.After assembly, I noted that the doors sag quite a bit - all plastic construction, so I didn't expect it to be perfect, but I have to lift up on the doors to get them to close. Additionally, anything on the inside that is heavy and leaning against the inside wall or the door will cause the entire structure to flex and lean some. Because of this, we decided to use this as more of a deck box than a shed. We have it on our screened in porch and will use it to store stuff that would normally be on the porch, not "shed" things like lawn tools or anything like that.This shed might work out as a good buy in the long run, but initial impressions are mixed and the frustration of not being able to get beyond step 2 without breaking out the cutting tools was a a real downer. Some of the other sizes might be better, but this size, while passable, isn't fantastic. YMMV.

The storage shed took me about 30 minutes on my own to assemble. There were two screws in the corners that went through several layers of plastic that I was unable to do by hand with a screwdriver and required a drill. The screws were all self tapping screws and so they were able to drill their own holes through the plastic as only two of the 11 or so screw holes were pre-drilled. I really like the overall look of the storage shed and the top lifting up as well as the doors opening out we're nice design features. However the frame and the structure just are not very sturdy and the shed is incredibly wiggly. I am disappointed with how little rigidity it has. The back wall/panel of the unit is also made from what looks like corrugated plastic. What I mean by this is it looks like corrugated cardboard but I believe it's made out of plastic. It was folded in half in the box and so is not even a solid sheet. I strongly feel that this does not help create much structure.

Pros - The shipping was fast and on time.  - The storage unit looks great  - Assembly was easy for the most partCons - The only issue I had was the side pieces not sliding all the way into the pre-cut holes that are on the outer rim of the flooring. After pushing as hard as I could and even beating on it with a rubber mallet to try and force the sides to slide all the way in, I ultimately had to use my oscillating saw to trim down the notches on the bottom of the side panels so it would slide all the way in. That worked perfectly and I was able to finish assembly which was a breeze after that.

This was very easy to install. It came with excellent instructions in a small booklet form. So often these days the instructions are too small to even read, but this is very easy to read with each page being the next step. And it carefully pictured the hardware so I would not confuse which screws to use where. This took me 90 minutes to install, but only because I took my time. I was impressed how sturdy the side pannels were especially. This comes shipped in TWO boxes, so don't freak out if the boxes do not arrive the same day. (Like I almost did until I noticed "1 of 2" on the first carton).

I had a metal shelf that got rusted and it because an eyesore.  Now I have this nice sturdy waterproof container that keeps all the pool toys and even my pool robot out of sight and safe from the sun, best idea

Firstly, it came very quickly….the pieces are clearly marked; the printed instructions are included (you don’t have to go online);  seems sturdy enough for its’ purpose.  Two of us put it together in under 30 minutes (I mostly held the walls up) and it was light enough for two of us to move it into place.  Now time will be the final review!

Nice size storage shed for lawn mower

Expect a few days to put it together.  But, overall a very nice shed for the price..

Very easy to put together

I’m using this to store my cushions for all outdoor furniture and it’s a perfect fit for oversized cushions.

The images show two trash containers enclosed but this has to be the largest model as this one will not hold two. That said this was easy to assemble and looks to be waterproof (haven’t had any rain as yet).I really needed a larger storage but elected to keep it and glad I did. It’ll store what I need for now, may get a second one in the fall when we put summer items in for winter storage.

Worked great for my needs

I put this little shed together in one hour. It's sturdy and both doors open and shut easily giving plenty of room to store my 6500 watt generator with room to spare for gas cans. I Installed the generator to allow exhaust out the doors when running!  Raise the top, open the doors for easy access to the generator. Remove the gas cans and open or close the top and I run the generator in wet/dry conditions. There's plenty of space for air circulation and heat escape!  AVOID FIRE HAZARD  !!!  REMOVE THE GAS CANS BEFORE RUNNING THE GENERATOR  !!! !!! AFTER USING,  LEAVE THE DOORS AND TOP OPEN TO ALLOW THE GENERATOR TO COOL DOWN  !!!

It’s a wonder product plus Yitomotors after sales CS is one of the best Custer services I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. Thank you so much

We ordered two of these and one came with two left doors.  I emailed the company photos and they sent a new shed the same day.  The sheds were very easy to put together and have worked well for what we needed.

Clear, easy to follow directions.  Very sturdy, quality fit/finish.  Highly recommend.

I’m thrilled this storage unit went together in about an hour!! I needed something to protect my charity donations in bad weather. This did the trick! The inside stays dry!! I didn’t put it on a platform and it’s working out nicely. Very pleased.

I would not have been able to assemble this by myself.  With two people, it was very easy and went together quickly.  So far, all the wood that is being stored in it, is dry and no bugs or critters have gotten inside of it.

When I originally purchased the product there was an issue with delivery. When I reached out to the customer service team, they were quick to respond and very helpful. They resolved all my issues, and I am very happy with the product itself. It was easy and fast to assemble. The lock latch doesn't allow for a very big lock but that was not an issue for me. It is great for lawn storage.

I was able to get this setup by myself in an hour. Great product and easy to install!

Works great as a trash bin. It has plenty of room and easy access while looking classy curbside

this is a surprising good value, well designed, and beautiful next to our garage.  it is a bluishgrey color family (the one I purchased) so it looks excellent next to our sky blue garage..

Comes in two packages. Fast hassle free delivery. Overall very easy to follow directions that takes less than an hour to assemble. Pretty sturdy and overall very good value. From a size perspective it matches the description and has a decent capacity. Overall no complaints.

We’ve had a similar shed previously from one of the recognizable brands, and this one from the start seems every bit equal and maybe even simpler in assembly. No special tools required. Straight forward design. Everything seems well thought out, durable, and sturdy. Great buy for $100-$150 savings.

So far, great product. Assembly was easier than anticipated and product is more durable than expected. Still waiting to see how weather resistant it is.  I bought this to keep my generator and pressure washer in so I can free up space in my shed

This box works great for me,keeps out weather and keeps things inside stored and dry.

Excellent

Bought this item for my garbage bins to keep raccoons from having nightly garbage parties.  Works like a charm.  Easily fits two 30 gallon bins and I’m no longer sweeping up garbage.  Little rascals were getting through bungee corded lids!

We lucked-out that UPS didn't pulverize the cartons, for once.  Shed went together with no problem.  Plenty of room inside and even matches our siding!

The instructions were very clear and easy to understand. All the sides are labeled, it took me about 20 minutes to put it together. Once together it’s fairly sturdy and easy to open.

easy to put together, great for a small back yard, sturdy and nice to look at!

Great Product - Easy  to assemble

After having our house re-sided we thought having the 2 old trash cans against the new siding looked pretty crappy. This is the perfect solution. It is easy to use (open the top or open the top/and 2 front doors), spacious, and clean looking.

Very easy to put together. Best with 2 people but if you’re cleaver you can figure it out. Keeps the elements out nicely. Using it to store hay and we’ve had some rain lately and the box kept it dry.

Went together fairly easily. It really helps to have two people do it but one person can. Seems extremely sturdy and good latching mechanism because I plan to use it to keep raccoons away from the garbage!!

Great quality for the price.  Purchased it to store trash barrels. Works great.  Strong structure.  Easy to put together.

Perfect all the way around.  Easy to assemble,  is holding 18 folding chairs for party times. Fits perfect and allowed enough room for 3 folding tables on side. Love it

Made nicely, easier than I thought to put together and so far no water getting in

Not much to say.  It is sturdy.  Looks good.  Easy to assemble.  Good value

I really love the product it’s made very sturdy. I only wish I’d gotten a bigger one.

Boyfriend loves it got everything to fit, lawn mower snow blower, shovels and a ladder. And it came on time.

So easy to assemble I did it all by myself and very easy to read instructions

look real neat

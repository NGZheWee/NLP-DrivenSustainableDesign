So Far, So Good!  This review is going through the docking station, the S9, and DEX, then displayed on a nice big screen!  I REALLY like using a REAL keyboard!Once it was delivered, I rushed to my workstation to see how it worked.  And it didn't!  Nothing, NOTHING would work.  It kept telling me to check the cables.  So out of frustration, I had lunch.It turned out that the case I bought for the S9 fooled me into thinking I had the DS plugged into the tablet, but it was not.  Once I had figured THAT out, the docking station, and the tablet worked well together.I like that I'm using two different RF Dongles for the keyboard and mouse plugged into the DS.  I don't have to use battery power to use Bluetooth for those accessories.  Plus, I still have one USB 3.0 port free.  The Keyboard and Mouse don't appear to lag, at all.  If it does, it is so minor that I am unable to percieve it.I like that I can power the Tablet from the DS.  I'm using a 20 watt Amazon charger, and it seems to work just fine.  The tablet doesn't give me any messages that I'm on a slow charge and it seems to charge as it does without the DS.The only real negative is that the cable from the DS to the Tab S9 is a bit too short for the tablet to be propped upright.  The tablet display remains on, and the S Pen can be used with it.  I'm thinking that I might want to use the tablet itself as a sort of touchpad sometimes.  I might find applications where I would want the tablet display to remain upright.  I don't know, but it MIGHT be a problem, maybe.Build quality seems good.  I think the DS case is metal, at least it looks and feels like aluminum.  And the cord going to the Tablet seems quite robust.  I can't comment yet on reliabiy,  It will take some time for that info to appear.  But functionally, it is everything the seller claims it is.

Brachmann,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024",1,"I needed a powered port expander for my DELL laptop.  I was having issues with data/communication to my printer and I read that a powered port extender would solve this.  This is the right tool for the job with a few caveats.  The multi-port is solid and well built and lightweight for travel.  My new DELL Inspiron 16 uses a smart power adapter.  The system must have a minimum of 65 watts to boot up.  When I attach the power adapter to the muli-port and then the multi-port to the laptop, get a message about a weak charge (see attached photo).  Working with the vendor and their support team, we tried several options.  They even sent me a 2nd unit at no added charge.  Sadly, the problem was still showing.  I suspect the smart power adaptor is sensing the draw of the multi-port regardless of the laptop and stepping down to a lower wattage.  Ultimately, I connected the power adapter directly to the laptop and then used a spare power adapter just for the multi-port.  My laptop now reboots properly and I have the powered multi-port I needed to support an additional display (HDMI), HP Desk Jet (USB 3.0), I-Book (standalone hard drive), a spare USB 3.0 port for thumb drive, and a port for my original non-powered 4-port USB extender which I still use for my free-standing keyboard, and my laptop vent (fan) system.  The USB-C cable used to connect the multi-port to the laptop is about 5 inches long, so I had some rearranging to make this spaghetti mess to workout.  I'm told it's to minimize data loss/corruption to drives, monitors, etc.  Everything now works great.The support team was very helpful and patient.  Never condescending or argumentative.  They responded to my original review the next day and offered a refund or a new device while we worked on the problem.  I kept the device and didn't seek a refund.  I'm very happy with them.  Do I wish it worked with the laptop adapter instead of a 2nd adapter?  Sure, but I don't see this as their problem but something with the DELL.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

Windows 10?  Android?  Yes!The design is a sleek metal case, seamless, with no visible screws.Slender, with no parts to lose, takes up very little space in the bag -- about as much as two Sharpie pens.It has a captive 6-inch cable with USB-C, and connections for USB-C PD, HDMI, Ethernet, and three USB 3.0 (blue) sockets.  Inside is a USB Hub, Ethernet Adapter, and HDMI display (&audio) output.The HDMI output is driven by your computer's internal graphics adapter, so the second monitor is integrated into both Windows and Linux with no additional drivers.  I believe it's done with a Via Labs VL100 ""Billboard"" Display Alternate mode adapter for USB-C, so it adds a second Monitor/Display instance, but not a new Display Adapter.The USB xHCI hub (VIA Labs 2109:0817 VL812 Super Speed Hub) appears on the bus, and this provides the three open USB ports as well as the new Ethernet Controller.  It's a Realtek USB GbE Family Controller:  VID: 0bda and PID: 8153.  Drivers were automatically available in both Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10.  It linked up to a 1Gb Ethernet as normal, no prompts or settings needed.For the adventurous, this UtechSmart device also works with the Samsung Galaxy S9+, and surprisingly well!Plug a USB Thumbdrive into the ports and it appears as a Storage Device, perfect for copying pictures off the phone.The Ethernet works as well, and automatically gets a DHCP address and switches over to wired connection.The HDMI monitor shows a clone of the Galaxy S9+ screen in perfect detail.  Best to rotate the phone to horizontal to make the most of the monitor.  (Sorry, no Samsung Dex environment here, but a USB Mouse and Keyboard work just fine.)Powering the adapter also charges the phone, as expected, but not as fast as a direct connection.  I was more impressed that the phone happily powered the whole adapter, with HDMI, Ethernet, and USB from its own battery, no problem.I was going to poke fun at the whole Phone + Adapter + Monitor, Ethernet, USB Drive, Keyboard, Mouse, but now that it's been running for a while on my desk, I'm imagining it could be useful if you intend to be at your phone for hours, hammering out email or Amazon reviews.All in all, this is a really nice piece of kit to have in your travel bag, or as a single-connection desktop dock.  It has replaced my USB-On-The-Go (OTG) adapters, as those were always a bit sketchy with some USB devices, and prevented charging..  Even if I don't need all the features, it's small enough on the bag that it's replaced a number of other adapters already.I accepted an offer to test and review this device, and received it for free, but this is my honest and unbiased review.

Tried using as the central component (hub if you will) of my Macbook Pro desktop setup. From the initial usage it was flaky, requiring multiple plug/un-plug cycles to get everything to work at the same time. 2/3 times the video would not work, maybe 1/4 times the USB would not work. Ended up taking an average of 4 or 5 times to plug in and remove to get everything working. Then after several months of this the power pass-through stopped working. I found out when I walked up to my device I had left plugged in and the battery was dead. Now it sort of works when I power through the other USB port but not when I try to pass power through. A few weeks after this the laptop's USB ports failed, I can't say what caused it of course but reading other reviews who also had their ports fail it does make me wonder.

Mine started to have difficulty connecting to my phone after 6 months, and at one year I have to plug it in several times to get it to connect. It also drops the connection at random.The other weakness it's had from day one is that the gigbit ethernet interface takes a lot of power. When using it to browse, the time it takes to charge from 15% increases from 2-3 hours to 10-30 hours (even with the factory charger that supports USB Power Delivery). Heavy use will drain the battery even when it's plugged in.Neither of these problems are the fault of the manufacturer or their engineers. USB-C just isn't as tough as USB-A or the ports on a good quality laptop docking station.

So I needed a hub that had PD so that power draw would always be sufficient to maintain connection.

I contacted customer service to request a warranty replacement, and they shipped one out within a couple days. After sthinking about why the first hub failed, I believe it could be a heat issue. I have 3 external USB SSDs connected to the hub along with the Ethernet port, and the USB C power delivery port to provide the necessary power.

I am using this product every day and it has been working.  I intend to keep using it and I would recommend it. But there are 5 minor things I experienced when using with a current model Catalina MacBook Pro.  I will document them in a quick video too:1.  it gets really hot.  This is typical of products that heat sink to the outer chassis, especially if it is metal and especially if you have all ports populated with active USB electronics.2. The connector is hard to withdraw from the USBC port because it fits tight and the handle is totally smooth.  Finger grips or surface knurls would make it much easier to unplug it.3.  When I use the HDMI output, for some reason my computer sees it as a DisplayPort device.  This hasn't caused any problems yet, but HDMI and DisplayPort EDID codes are not the same, so I can see situations where it could be an issue.4.  Every so often the audio over the HDMI output will not work.  I have been unable to track this problem to my computer or my TV since they work independently and with every other scenario I have tried.  So it must be the hub.  If I put the computer to sleep, the problem will be fixed when I wake it back up.5.  When the computer is shut down, sometimes the power light on my webcam will flicker.  This shouldn't really be happening since the power supply input is strictly for charging the computer and shouldn't be powering anything else.  So far it has not caused issues, but it worries me a little.It is worth the money, good size, good construction, so far I am happy with it.THANKS!",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I am speaking for my macbook pro 2019 I am not sure if theres a different result on older models. If you hook up two or more monitors to this thing the monitors will have the same exact screen. They can't work as their own. I had one hooked up to the hdmi and the other two the vga. Second, this docking station gets very hot. I have had to hook up two of them because I had another one I was going to sell once I got this one, but since this one doesn't work for dual external monitors I had to keep it in order to use both monitors separately. Finally and most important, it blew out the usb-c port it was connected to. I then googled what to do and was told by many forums to try and do a simple ""sms reset"" which could possibly fix the port, but instead it blew out my batter and destroyed my logic board aka ""mother board"" and I lost my data and had to take it in to be repaired. I have to believe that my port going out and then this happening to my batter/logic board were connected because an smc reset is harmless. My macbook pro 2019 was only 3 months old.  I am only giving this two stars because you if you can remember to unplug and or not let it run all day every day it might not end up happening with the same result. But it gets very hot very quickly so if you can find another docking station that fits your needs I highly recommend getting that one.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

When plugging in the XPS13 powersupply, factory, and then plugging the hub in to the laptop I was greeted with a message at startup letting me know that the charging device detected would not be able to power the laptop entirely on its own and would require battery usage.2.  High pitched noise coming from the the hub when the Dell XPS13 powersupply was plugged in.  This noise sounds like a coil whine, but is most likely some type of ground loop issue.Both of these issues could be a product of the Dell's power supply, but in either case it does not seem to be a good match for the XPS13 7390 2-in-1.

In addition, they inquired if there were any other remedies they could offer to make things right. Therefore I am updating my review as the product works well but buyers should be aware of the issue that occurs when the computer sleeps as noted previously.Been using this for over a month as a dock for a laptop to connect to dual displays with the lid closed. I quickly realized that every time the computer went to sleep while not in use, when I brought it back online the 2 displays would no longer extend, only duplicate the same thing on both screens. After some troubleshooting i discovered that the dock had to be unplugged from power and the computer and everything plugged back in to get the extend display function to work again.I contacted customer care via email and was told the item was defective and offered a $20 refund (it costs $79).  When I pointed out the original cost, they asked me to return it and they would send a refund.  I proposed they send a new unit and I would return the defective one when it was received. Then they replied that it wasn't actually defective, but that the product does in fact have to be unplugged each time the computer goes into sleep mode so it is working ""properly"".  If that's true it should have been noted in the description because who wants to unplug everything and plug it back in every time you walk away for a while? I adjusted my power settings somewhat as a workaround but don't want to leave the computer running 24/7 so it is still a problem I have to deal with.

For my desktop, My Wacom Cintiq 16 has USB-c ports which are more useful with different ports. more USB-A ports are nice and are useful and the Micro SD/ SD slots work well. I don't have a need for the Ethernet port BUT when plugged into my Ipad Pro 2018 it does pop up as 10/100/1000 possible connection. Officially, it does NOT support  Ipad Pros, but it kind of does. the ports all work for the Ipad, plug in a micro sd/SD card and it will open up the photos app to import pictures. If you plug in a keyboard to the USB- A ports (normal USB ports) the keyboard will work. If you plug in any USB hard drive/ flash drive it will not work correctly but that is an apple issue. My two complaints are minor, I wish it had an AUX port. More Apple devices are ditching AUX and adding that in somewhere would have been a better move than a micro sd slot since most micro SD cards come with an adapter to SD.  It also seems to require additional power when connecting the Ipad to a monitor, which is fine since it has USB-C power in, but you need to plug it in this order: HDMI, USB-C Power, USB-C to the device.Edit/Update: After talking to their support we discovered that a setting on the ipad needed to be turned on and then it would support 4k.

You don't have to have the power adapter, but it is nice not to have to plug your laptop into a wall socket and just have the single USB-C plug going from the docking station to the laptop.  I use 5 of the ports on the docking station - The two HDMI ports for the monitors, one USB port for the bluetooth keyboard and mouse, one for the USB-C power supply and the last is to charge my headphones for work calls.  This setup has helped me be as efficient at home as I am when I'm in the office.  I'll keep this setup even after I'm able to return to the office for those days when I need to work from home.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I really love how cute it is and how it protects my phone after dropping it on accident. The only negative thing I would say is that I brought my first one in May and I just purchased another in July, my old case started to turn brown/yellow and the purple outline kinda got bleached from the sun. Other than that I don’t really mind buying another one from this company, the case doesn’t leave any water marks or anything like that, just normal wear and tear. I would like to see them address the cases turning brown/yellow so quickly though. Other than that great product! Will be purchasing again in the future:)",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

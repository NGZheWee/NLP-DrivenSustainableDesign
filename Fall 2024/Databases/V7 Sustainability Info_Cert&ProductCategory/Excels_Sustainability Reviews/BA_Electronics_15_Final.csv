It's fast and efficient, especially duplex printing, which is automatic as opposed to earlier models that only duplex manually.  It is also a much quieter printing LaserJet as compared to our other larger P3005d.  As this is the wireless model it came in handy printing from my iPhone and avoided the usual process of emailing photos from my phone to my computer and then printing.  Also the set up was essentially plug and play.One down side is the paper tray that only holds about half a ream.

Fast printing, excellent print quality and fast auto duplexer with nice ""automatic duplexing"".  Only two drawbacks, as others have noted: (1)  Expensive toner replacement and security chip forces you to use HP cartridges in the guise of ""preventing toner cartridge theft"", which is beyond unbelievable.  (2) The HP support site is one of the worst I have ever encountered.  I consider myself lucky to have downloaded and installed the correct printer drivers/software on first try, just by chance clicked on the right buttons.  Perhaps this is an offshore support site?  I would never expect such a confusing support site from such a large company and flagship products with the good reputation of HP.  God help us if we need support from the site.  Otherwise, a great little printer for routine office print jobs and check printing, if you do not have high volume demands that would make the expensive toner replacement an issue.  P.S. Generic toner replacement is available, but involves removing a chip from the old cartridge and gluing it to the new one (the printer cartridge will no longer display the amount of toner remaining) and HP states that the security chips may change over time (obviously, to discourage the competition on toner cartridge replacement).  Someone should file an unfair trade practices case on this.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

My key functions requires are scanning and printing.  Not a high page volume, but good print quality is important.I do not connect my printers via wifi, I have found that regardless of who makes the printers, a wifi connection is not reliable.  I unboxed the printer, followed all instructions, and hooked the printer up to my computer directly via USB port.  Now on any other printer I have set up, that type of connection is very simple and reliable.The printer did print for me from my computer, but it seems to take a lot of time to warm up and print a page.  Not like 10 seconds, more time than that.  Like when you hit print then wait.....and wait....and wait.....then start wondering ""did I not finish submitting the print job?""  Then you go back, hit print again, then right when you hit print the first job finally starts.  That would be annoying in time.I found the desktop app which is similar to the app I had with my old HP.  I tried to scan and for some reason, the app cant find my printer.  Everything I tried, no luck being able to have my computer and printer communicate to scan.  How can it print but not scan?  I tried the printer controls, incredibly vague and seems to want to scan to email.  What about scanning to a computer?  Its like Kyocera felt that was not important.  Scan to a thumb drive, sure thats there.  But what about my computer?  I am not a spy, I want to scan to my computer.The instructions are a joke.  They only cover 5-6 steps on the install and provide one line of instructions per step.  Then have that translated to 10 different languages so its hard to find anything helpful.  I tried going online, again nothing.I am returning the device and getting something different.  I bet the printer works fine and it requires a technician to install it so it works.  That is kind of ridiculous for no networking being involved.  Even if I bite the bullet and pay the $150 to have a tech come out and install it, what happens when I get another computer?  Another $150?  This is not a device that is easy to set up.  If you have your own IT department, ok it may be fine.

I use wired ethernet. The only thing to know - it took literally half an hour to transfer toner from a cartridge once powered up for the first time. After that, it's super quick.It should be very serviceable, with lots of replaceable parts. Cartridge contains only toner, and it's cheap at $60 for a genuine one. Drum is a separate part which should last way longer than usual. And there are more parts which could be replaced if needed. Could be cleaned too.Read the manual!

There are multiple problems, some of which are systemwide for HP and some of which appear to be that I got a lemon. Lemon Problems: 1) It cycles through sleep/wake up like every minute. I actually timed it once. It goes into sleep mode at 10:19 am, wakes up before 10:20, whirs and clicks for about a minute, then turns off again...then right back on less than a minute later. It was crazy making! I have to turn the machine off when I'm not trying to print or it drives me crazy. So, every time I need to print or scan anything, I have to turn the machine on and wait for it to warm up. PITA! 2)Today, I came into my office (at home because pandemic) and had to print something first thing before settling down to work on a deadline. Printer won't print! I can see the job in the job queue on my computer, I can see the printer view screen responding to the information being sent, but the printer never prints anything. I've tried changing to a different network (I have several), I tried turning it off and turning it on again, I tried changing to direct print. Nothing. Then, in the midst of this, I get a blue screen with an error code. That was the last straw for me. My IT person told me he thought the sleep/wake issue was a sign of a lemon and I should return. So, today, I came here to log a return, only to find out the return window is one month and it's over. So, my only option is tech support and HP has me on hold rn. They told me that *if* they determine replacing the machine is the thing to do, it will be replaced with a refurbished machine, not a new one. That is utter bu11sh1t. I'm pissed. I run a non-profit. We aren't made of money. We had a grant that covered this. Giving us a used printer when this is 100% an HP-cause problem is unacceptable. NOW, for the HP-system wide problem. If you use a MAC, you will not be able to scan to email. In fact, it sounds like no one can scan to email because everyone in the world has updated their security protocols EXCEPT HP. So, there is that. You will have to scan to thumb drive and then plug that in to your ocmputer and then move the files over. Who has time for that?!

And when printing black and white, I always shut the color option to off.Imagine my surprise to find EXTREMELY LOW levels on the color cartridges.Their marketing states that my 414A toner cartridges are “designed for lasting use.”They’ve only been in for a little over two months and I’ve only printed approximately 50 color sheets.Why on EARTH would my toner be this low? This is the first time I’ve ever owned an HP product of any kind, and as we all know, HP printers and your toner cartridges are not cheap in any way.So, is this some kind of a toner rip-off scheme? How ... HOW HOW HOW HOW can my $130 PER CARTRIDGE  toner be THIS LOW after 50 color sheets?? HOW?!If anyone knows someone in higher management at HP, show them this.

It came off fairly easily but did rip in half and get pretty crumpled up which I thought was odd.I proceeded to set up the printer and test everything but when I tried the copier with a page fed through the top tray, everything jammed up.  It's at this point after googling for answers my brain finally registered the ""red circle with a slash"" over the piece of flimsy plastic covering the scanner surface.  I felt pretty stupid until I looked at the comments online and realized MANY people make the same mistake.  Seriously HP... you shower the printer with all kinds of little pieces of plastic protective film and this looks no different, but you highlight this particular piece and actually have a diagram of a hand pulling it off.  I know I should have properly registered the fact that there was a ""circle and slash"" over it, but clearly I'm not alone in misinterpreting this!  How about WORDS that say DO NOT REMOVE!I tried going to HP support and it simply does not work.  I can't log in, register the product or an account, etc.  It's been one hell of a frustrating day with HP!!!  Can someone here tell me how I can get a replacement piece of cheap plastic for the copy scanner head / feeder???  This piece TOTALLY looks like an afterthought fix for something that clearly wasn't working properly.  Who lightly glues a piece of cheap plastic film as a mandatory component to the outside of a very expen$ive printer?!?!?!?

Hughes,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023",1,"This HP Pro MFP M479fdw prints fine until you need to buy a set of replacement ink / toner cartridges which cost nearly as much as a brand-new machine. Then the HP Pro MFP M479fdw becomes nothing more than a paperweight.HP places chips in their ink / toner cartridges and requires you to only use their refills. The problem is that their refills are incredibly expensive, and no better than non-OEM cartridges.There is no way to disable this feature from the firmware, so once you buy the HP printer, you are forced for the life of the machine to pay whatever HP decides to charge. You have no right to repair or replace the HP ink or toner cartridges at all.This printer now costs me more to own and operate than any other laser jet on the market, and I will never again buy an HP-- personally or professionally.

We first ordered the ""Enterprise"" version of this printer (model #M480F), which is essentially the same but with a higher ""pages per month"" rating. It arrived completely useless with a defective fuser. HP tech support agreed. We were able to return it to Amazon, and then we purchased the M479. At first, everything seemed fine with the new printer. I tried to order the optional 3rd paper tray. It arrived, but it would throw a jamming error any time it tried to grab a piece of paper. Again, HP determined that it was a defective unit and it was replaced. The second one has been fine. Now, flash forward to a month or two later:The M479 comes installed with some cheap introductory toner cartridges with limited capacity. I expected that these wouldn't last too long, but we also don't print anything with color in the office. The printer eventually told me they were empty, so we purchased a full set of high-capacity color cartridges (which cost approximately $600). When I installed these brand new genuine HP cartridges, the printer recognized them as having the same capacity as the introductory cartridges (I think it's only like 150-200 pages?). In fact, the embedded web server showed that new introductory cartridges were installed and that they were not the high-capacity version. Weird. I figured it wasn't a big deal, because if the cartridges have toner in them, then we'll still be able to print color. It shouldn't matter what the display says, right?Wrong. About a month later, after barely printing any color pages, the printer again told me that the cartridges were empty. They were not. They were still heavy and obviously full of toner. So again, I contact HP. After hours of troubleshooting and trying various methods to reset the printer, they determined that it was a defective unit and acknowledged that something was very wrong. We were also out of warranty. At this point, the color cartridges had begun to seize and squeak. Even though they were still full, the printer was telling these cartridges to act like they were empty (hence the squeaking and seizing, the grinding, the constant messages telling us that the cartridges are empty). It's important to mention that these noises from the seizing and leaking cartridges are still audible when you're only printing in black and white.So after purchasing 4 separate pieces of hardware from HP, 3 of them were delivered as defective. We purchased $600 worth of color toner and were told ""sorry"" when the printer refused to acknowledge which cartridges were actually installed. We've also seen multiple error messages which indicate a fuser motor defect. This printer is now two years old and has printed 60,000 pages. Sure, it still prints in black and white, but the noises are unbearable. I'm talking about a solid 80-90 decibel screech. You can't even talk on the phone if someone is printing something. HP's suggestion was to replace the color toner cartridges, because they make noise when they run out! Great, so the noises will go away for another month or two at a cost of $600 and then you'll tell us to replace them again when the printer decides they're empty? It is now essentially useless to us and we wasted more money on toner than it cost to buy the entire thing in the first place. We're replacing it with a Brother. I will never purchase hardware from HP again.I'm giving this 2 stars because the scanning/copying features have been fine and have never failed us.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

Then I saw the newer M479fdw was on sale for $398, only $50 more and decided it to buy it, since it was to be a newer better model and with 2-sided scanning. But after using both models for the past week, I can say that the M281fdw is the better built unit, while the M479fdw has some issues.First off, the M479 has a very loud cooling fan that always stays on while the unit is on (even when not printing). The only way to stop the fan is to have the unit set to go into Sleep Mode after 10 minutes of non-use. When printing, there is also a noticeable high-voltage electrical sound coming from the vents on the right side. This is the only laser printer that I've ever heard this type of sound from, and it just sounds like there's an electrical problem. The M281 model doesn't have a loud cooling fan that stays on all the time (in fact, I'm not sure if it has a fan) and there is no high-voltage transformer buzzing when it prints.Regarding the actual printing, for Black Text and basic color documents, both M479 and M281 are identical. But when it comes to printing a color picture, the M281 produces better looking and more realistic colors, while the M479 colors are more dull/faded and don't match the original picture. I made sure both printers are using the same color settings and have the newest Firmware and Drivers installed. But no matter what I try, the color pictures from the M479 don't look as good as from the M281.Lastly, for copying Black Text, both models are the same, with the advantage of 2-sided scanning on the M479. But for color copying, the M479 looks terrible. I tried to copy a few pictures (that where original film-to-paper prints or from an inkjet) and the color copies on the M479 look way off. But on the M281 the color copies are much closer to the original.That being said, the M479 is Made in Mexico and the M281 is made in Vietnam, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.Overall, I wish the M479fdw worked as well for colors as the M281fdw, as I like the 2-sided scanning and the larger LCD Display. But the loud cooling fan and high-voltage electrical buzzing on the M479 are a deal-breaker for me. Between the two, I just like the M281fdw more, it prints better colors, is a quieter and smaller unit, and feels better made.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

Quality of print is great.  Speed is acceptable though it bogs down with complex jobs.  Paper handling is solid.  Networking and configuration are good.  And all of this seems to be at a reasonable price... so long as you never have to replace the printer toner cartridges.  Be prepared to shell out at least $450 for HP cartridges.  There are after market cartridges but those require that you pluck the proprietary chips out of the HP cartridges to use them and even then you will see errors on the printer.

Hawks,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024",2,"I started in IT before laser printers were invented and before HP even made printers. When they came out with their initial laser printers, they were the workhorses of the industry and their printers were built like their calculators - tanks. But even then, there were always driver and/or functionality issues. Later in life, after HP had somehow established itself as the defacto standard in laser printers, I headed up a large IT department and HP somehow always convinced us to go with their products. My support team certainly had way more than their share of help desk triage calls to go deal with dysfunctional HP printers. You'd think I'd have learned over the years to avoid these continuously worsening pieces of technological disasters, but no... I have made the mistake several times of purchasing and installing HP printers in my home & office.Now having owned and attempted to regularly use a Color Laserjet MFP M479fdw AIO for a couple of years, it has become my proverbial last straw with HP printers, and most likely ANYTHING HP. This printer has always/continuously had some sort of issue, since day one. These days, it stops working not daily, but literally hourly or less. It is constantly going offline, printing errantly if online, and/or suddenly out of nowhere waking up and printing a document you gave up on hours or days prior, even if you deleted it out of the source's print queue. These machines come haunted from the factory. And the drivers/files are HUGE 470MB just for the printer driver alone on a Mac. IIRC, larger on my Windows PC. It's got a scanner, so add another 190MB for that too - and that's just the install file size. Once it's done installing, it actually takes up far MORE space on your drive.Oh, and HP's replacement cartridge strategy of: when it runs out of toner, we're going to charge you so much to replace the cartridges that you can literally buy a new printer for less, so go do that - is completely unacceptable (which I have fallen for a few times with HP color lasers - what a ridiculously wasteful and environmentally disrespectful approach to printing - SHAME ON YOU HP!) And several times, when we've purchased new HP cartridges, taken them out of the original HP boxes and installed them into this printer, it throws an error stating that the cartridges aren't HP OEM and it will not use them/print at all.Oh, and no Internet connection? Then no printing. It doesn't matter if you elect to go with their online account, or print drivers or print controlling or not, the printer still insists on having an active Internet connection (what kind of data are HP collecting without our knowledge??) before becoming functional.After 40+ years, I'm finally done. I have raged, complained, and dealt with their worst-on-the-planet (lack of) customer service, etc. for the last time. If you call them, they will tell you they cannot help you, and then attempt to upsell you on something, like support or an extended warranty - even if the product you're calling on IS still under warranty. Absurd!Ironically, I still have and love (even though I hardly ever use them anymore) my old engineering, finance, and computer programming HP calculators, and they are still phenomenal. What happened to those days and that company??If you are considering this (or any) HP printer, do yourself a favor and stop the possibility of being driven insane by a device that will work intermittently at best, have drivers that are always a royal pain to install and use (AND don't work/install most of the time), and buy a brand other than HP. What once, long, LONG ago was a halfway decent printing solution company has turned into a money grabbing, unreliable, torture device manufacturer with no support. PLEASE don't do it. You'll be kicking yourself and regretting it (like me) if you do.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

This printer is not cheap; however, it is already starting to pay itself off on reduced inkjet costs.  Full review below!Setup:The printer was very easy to set up for computers and from phones/tablets.  The HP Smart App was very user friendly and I experienced no issues getting it set up in just a few minutes.Speed:The printer is extremely fast at warming up and printing.  It is at least twice as fast as the inkjet I was using that was only a few years old.  Two sided printing for less paper use is very speedy as well.Print Quality:The printer has a variety of print quality settings, none of which you will use regularly.  The standard setting is fantastic for office level print quality.  For the occasional picture or flyer, it does a fantastic job on the print quality.Scanning:Openly admit that one of the features I had to have was 2 sided scanning.  Why have a printer that can print on two sides if you can't scan on both sides!?  This has just helped cut my paper consumption considerably.Toner:Toner lasts much much longer than any inkjet cartridge.  This is such a benefit to the environment if you look at your waste stream per page.  The toners from my purchase are still going strong after 428 sheets.  I was going through an XL HP 62 cartridge every week prior to this purchase.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Does not wake up for maintenance. - Supports a lot of protocols for printing to the printer (IPP/IPPS, AirPrint, some stuff through HP apps, Google Cloud Print, LDP, and a few more). - Thankfully allows for moderately complex setup of networking (can change hostname, configure/manage IPv4 and IPv6 networking, NTP time sync, etc.). - Wireless connectivity works as advertised. Did not try printing with a direct wireless connection, Bluetooth, or Ethernet (although options for managing all of those exist in the administration pages). - Printing works as expected. Seeing that this is my first laser printer, it is significantly faster than any inkjet I've printed. It doesn't take particularly long to warm up. Color printing of photos works well, although they seem a bit dark compared to a calibrated display (could also be the lighting in the rooms I was looking at wasn't the brightest). Details are sharp, and I'm honestly surprised at the quality. I'm not seeing any artifacting, really. I would still print photos with some other device (say, at Walmart or CVS or Walgreens using a dedicated photo kiosk) to conserve color toner (plus it'll likely be better), but this printer looks to be good for general purpose color printing.The meh: - Support was prompt, but had me follow a pretty basic script to diagnose issues with the scanner. They were unable to fix my issues, and told me to get a replacement unit from Amazon, which I did. The fact that I had to get a new unit was an annoyance, and looking at all of the forums online, it looks like ADF issues with HP printers are very frequent. Either HP sells way more printers than everyone else combined, or HP has a quality control issue when it comes to ADFs. - Installation software for Windows is slow and sluggish (and hung once for me). I expect some of that is downloading a whole swath of archives, but it also hung for about 20 minutes trying to set up faxing (I think, the UI was glitching) even though I didn't need to set that up. The second time I went through the setup the software didn't hang, although sometimes it looked like it did. It went much faster.The bad: - Bug in the web server: if the password for the email account one is going to use to send notifications has an ampersand (&) in it, the web server or whatever service the printer has escapes ""&"" to ""& amp"" (without the space, Amazon seems to be filtering out the & HTML code) (e.g. ""abc&123"" becomes ""abc& amp123""), which obviously causes SMTP authentication to fail. Since the internal software for the printer is closed source, there is nothing I could do to fix that. This is something that HP will have to address. - For my original printer, ADF scanning was tilted/skewed, which seems to be a common problem. Seeing that I specifically bought this printer for its ADF (otherwise I would have picked a Brother with better reviews for a color laser printer), this was a deal breaker for me. I followed instructions from HP support to clean the (brand new) ADF sheet feeder rollers, and to adjust the paper binders of the ADF, to no avail. They told me to send the printer back for a replacement, which I received. The very first thing I tested was the ADF alignment, since if that was bad I was just going to request a full refund and just buy a printer from a different manufacturer. Lucky for HP (for now), this ADF seems to work better.- This second printer developed a squeak when feeding paper through the system. HP support thinks is the toner/drum, but I tested removing one at a time to no avail, and the drum is very securely held in the system so I did not remove it (requires removing parts of the casing and unscrewing some elements and manually disconnecting a bunch of small wires). HP support did send a technician to look at it, and they replaced the power board, which changed the squeaking/chirping noise slightly, but it was still there. The first printer did not have this. In the end, I returned the second printer to Amazon for a refund. -- I did notice something about the ADF which seems like a design flaw, and might be the cause of all of the mis-alignment complaints that plague a lot of HP ADFs. Well, really two things, but related: 1. There is only one motorized wheel in the middle of the ADF to move papers through the ADF for scanning, and 2. it seems like this roller sticks out a tiny amount from where the paper rests in the ADF, so if the paper guides aren't set properly, the paper, once pushed into the ADF securely, will most likely lean to one side or another, likely leading to the skew or tilt I saw with the other printer. The paper guides must be set pretty much perfectly (tall order) to prevent this skew. I noticed this with my current printer, but I took a lot more care to make sure the paper guides were pretty much perfect to prevent the paper from tilting inside the ADF. The way to do this (or at least how I did it) is to take a stack of papers, place the papers on the ADF but don't push them all the way in (so the stack doesn't swivel around the wheel), make sure they stay as much as in a stack as possible, and now adjust the paper guides around this stack (the way I did this was over-adjusting the guides so the papers bent a little, then holding the guides with one hand and pushing the paper flat with the other slowly, so that the guides were slowly pushed to the perfect size). So long as nothing touches the guides after this adjustment (and one doesn't get a defective ADF), there should be next to no tilt or skew.I've taken a few pictures of the print quality report the printer took. The first picture is one of both the original (on the left), and the copied one, read in from the ADF. Notice the lack of a skew. The second picture is a closeup of the original quality report, and the third picture is the copy of the quality report as scanned through the ADF. One thing to note with the third image is  that it seems that with solid colors, the scan produced some line patterns. Since I haven't played enough with the scanner yet, I don't know if this is a limitation of the scanner, the result of some pre/post-processing to ""clean-up"" the image, or just the quality of the scanner. Looking at the quality of the printer, it's not the printer part that's producing those artifacts.Overall: If you get a printer with a decent ADF, it seems to be a good color laser printer for its price. Some units tend to have a bad ADF, and even with a good printer it looks like the ADF has a design flaw that makes it difficult to line up the pages, but it can be made to work. Printer works as expected and I am pleased at how fast it is, and the web administration is pretty nice. I'm taking one star away for the password bug I mentioned and how finicky the ADF can be, and another for HP's bad QA, otherwise this looks like a capable printer. I would like to see HP design a better ADF for future models, though. I'm sure some people will like the printer, but I just don't want to deal with the possibility of getting another bad one, so I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 0, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Still can't get the email to work but can print wireless so that is nice. The print quality is very good and only recently started to have problems with extra lines on the paper and the auto feed often feeds in a little crooked. My biggest con on this printer which is why I rate it a 3 is it runs through cartriges quickly and they run $120 to $170 for color and $90 to $110 for black. If you do high volumn printing this printer will do the job but it will cost you. I'm lucky to get 500 prints out of a full set of cartriges and yes, I reduced the quality to try to save but I need the high quality prints for my business.

So far it prints perfectly.  The ADF works fine, including the rare feature of 2-sided scanning without having to flip the page mechanically.  After a bit of a false start, I found that I can manage (and selectively disable) its many options nicely through the web interface. I love that is has features like being able to force it to use only black toner even when receiving color jobs, and that can even be done per user (if you're using authN). We have Macs, iPads, Windows 10, and  Windows 8 systems here. The only one that gave any difficulty with setup was the Win8 and it's flaky anyway.  I appreciate how quickly it starts, prints, and then shuts down -- much quieter than the old printer.CONS: The flatbed scanner works great for single sheets on it, but it's designed horribly for scanning from bound books. It looks like it should work, but cuts off more than an inch from the edge, making it useless.  The little touch screen app is not designed well. Even with small fingers and careful use, it's too easy to hit the wrong thing in some places. It's sufficiently functional but could work better.  If you know anything about how to configure networks and devices, you're better off NOT using the terrible HP app for ""easy setup"".  Like most cheapskate companies these days, its toner cartridges are INSANELY OVERPRICED, and it comes with crappy half-empty ones. But I'm hoping that the fact the cartridges include the drum units will help avoid some of the long-term maintenance problems I had with Brother (see below).Background:I recently bought this to replace the color Brother MFC-9840CDW I suffered with for years. Those Brothers have a great ADF but many serious design flaws in the print mechanisms, the worst being defective (real OEM) toner cartridges that spew toner throughout the machine, even when brand new.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Between the two the M479fdw is larger, faster, and it is cheaper to run (assuming you are buying genuine HP Toner).  Unless you are actually printing several thousand pages per month and need the speed, or you are a business managing a ton of printers and need some of the 'enterprise' management features, the only benefit of the M479fdw over the M281fdw is that it can do duplex scanning from the document feeder, which means a lot faster scanning of large documents.On the toner side, at least for the time being the M479fdw doesn't have any available 3rd party toner that doesn't involve removing a chip from the existing cartridge.  That is almost as much of a pain as cutting a hole and refilling it yourself.  In contrast, for the M281fdw there does exist 3rd party toner which works pretty well.  The color might be a little different, but if you are that picky on color accuracy you either own tools to calibrate and correct that, or you should be using an inkjet photo printer in the first place.Setup - make sure you download the 'F' driver for the M479fdw not the drivers for the non-Fax model, they are different and do not work quite right.UPDATE:  Like too many devices the wireless on this has an implementation error.  If your wifi uses 2.4G and 5G (dual band or even tri-band) you MUST have different names or this will have connection peoblems.  A fully compliant wifi stack is supposed to actually be able to connect to both at the same time and increase throughput when they have the same name or just move seamlessly between them.

I went ahead and bought replacements cartridges online, to have them whenever mine would be empty. That day has come and today, in need of printing documents before christmas, I installed them. Turns out HP has put in the firmware a check to disable any printing attempted without HP cartridges (which they sell for triple the price, for the EXACT same thing).So now, I cannot print my documents even though I have a perfectly functioning printer and cartridges, just because HP decides that their motivation to make indecent margins at my expense is higher than the motivation they have to put me first.Because now, I have wasted money on cartridges, I have to buy a new printer, and I still won't have my documents printed today unless I drive to town and find a place that will print me copies. So all of this will waste me about $500 plus 3 hours of my time at 150 an hour, so HP's policy of being anti-customer has costed me $950.When a company pretends to put customer first and then does that, you know that they have no link between the marketing values and their actual values.

The problem is the documents feeder:  when documents come out into the output tray the design is such that the rear end of the paper doesn't often fall down enough to avoid the front edge of the following document from hitting it, causing a jam in the output tray.  The level of the output tray just isn't low enough to prevent recurring jams, even when putting as little as ten sheets through, whether faxing, scanning, or copying.  Forget about putting more sheets than 10 through, you just can't place the sheets in the feeder and walk away.  You'll have to stand there and nurse the sheets through to prevent jamming, even removing them one at a time as they pass through.  As you can imagine that's a deal-breaker - I wish I never bought this machine because that's a royal pain-in-the-neck.  It's as if they never put the device through its paces before producing it because I can't imagine how they brought this to production with this huge flaw.

With that said, if you have the proper ecosystem established, this printer is a vertical or tour de force. I have mine configured in my home office running directly to the router hub via Ethernet cable. This would mean that as long as you access the LAN you can send print jobs to the printer.Being a laser printer, it’s blazing fast! The print is crisp and lines are sharp. I use this to print a lot of legal documents and declarations and it’s been holding up incredibly well. It is also very good on toner ( ink) conservation. If you want something suited for small to medium office use or even personal (given the connectivity limitation) I have no problems recommending this.

Compared to K740, here is my summary of the Cherry Stream SX:1. Its keys have more travel than Logitech K740 illuminated keyboard2. The key strokes feel slightly firmer than K740, i.e. the keys are more springy and have more resistance3. It is definitely not as quiet as K7404. It does not have back lights to illuminate the keys in the dark.5. The shortcut keys at the top are not scissor mechanism. As a comparison, all of K740's keys are scissor switch-based.6. It does not have a palm rest like the K740 does.7. The whole keyboard feels plastic dominant. Not sure if the key letters are laser etched onto the caps but time will tell.The verdict:Similar to the phone and computer market right now, the keyboard market is in an innovation desert. There are no decent keyboards with great typing experience. Logitech has rolled out some mediocre keyboards like MX Keys, but made a deadly wrong strategic decision to move almost their entire keyboard product line to battery-powered wireless crap. While doing that, they also ceased production of K740. As a result, the keyboard market is in a dry spell with no end in sight. Cherry's Stream SX is the only decent substitute for K740 for now. Believe me, your office colleagues will want to strangle you if you use a clicky, loud mechanical keyboard in the cubicle.Although it fell short when compared with Logitech K740, it is more laptop-keyboard like compared to Kensington Slim Type Wired Keyboard (K72357USA) and Perixx PERIBOARD-211US, Ultrathin Design Keyboard, as the latter two have keys that are too firm which will quickly lead to typing fatigue.All told, the Cherry Stream SX does deliver decent typing experience, is reasonably quiet, and is corded (this is important because you don't have to buy battery to power the keyboard; besides, wireless keyboards are never secure against prying eyes in the air). It is the only reasonable choice if you want a K740 substitute or a quiet keyboard with decent typing speed.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It is very comfortable pressing the buttons, and none of frequent typing errors as the previous keyboard. The keyboard has a good weight, so it does not move around once it is set up. I wish it came with a wrist pad, but that's just a minor gripe.I use a Mac Mini M2, and this Windows keyboard works fine for the most part. The media keys on the top row works without any tweaking. I use BetterTouchTool to reassign keys on the F key row. I use those to launch apps and for common keyboard shortcuts. Only the three keys on the far right side cannot be assigned. The leftmost button on that group (the one with lock icon) works for some reason.I prefer a wired keyboard, so I don't have to change batteries from time to time.

At first I was frustrated to see that I received what looked like the wrong keyboard based on the image on the box. Out of desperation to get rid of the keyboard supplied by my employer, I decided to take a chance and open the box to see what was really inside. To my pleasant surprise, I find a QWERTY keyboard with the added € sign as indicated on the box. So the box was misleading in this case. The seller/Amazon needs to be more mindful of how their products are advertised. I’m sure there are people who have retuned theirs thinking they received the wrong one when in fact they didn’t; the box is just labeled wrong. I’ve kept the keyboard and am currently using it. I’ve only used it for a day so it’s way too early to tell if it’s going to last but I doubt it won’t. I have a Cherry mechanical keyboard that I’ve used for over a year without any technical or mechanical issues. I was aiming to get a keyboard that’s as quiet as my laptop’s for work purposes and this one is pretty close to that.I have posted a picture of what I thought I received and what I actually received as well as a video showing how loud this keyboard is compared to my laptop’s. I recorded the video with all the noisy appliances in my vicinity turned off; however, there is some background noise because of the cars/trucks driving by. I also tend to press on the keys a little aggressively so if you’re a person with feather-light fingers that simply boops the keys to type, the noise would be considerably less.",-1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It is one of the better feeling keyboards to type on. The mouse was also surprisingly comfortable, as I don't usually like full size mice.However, the first one I ordered came in a package that had obviously been opened before and repackaged (thankfully at least with fresh batteries), even though it was listed as ""new"" and not ""open box"" (the seller was actually Cherry themselves). One of the rubber feet from the keyboard was already detached in the black tissue paper it comes wrapped in, but I was able to stick it back on. The keyboard would not power on at all without fidgeting with the batteries a little. I finally got it to work, and it was fine for about a week, and then the spacebar started to squeak. I exchanged it for another.The second one was fine also for about a week, and this time appeared to be unopened and had no problems powering on the keyboard. However, after a week, it thinks the ALT key is permanently depressed. Every keystroke registers as ALT + the key. I tried turning it off and on, replacing the batteries. Nothing helped. I also tried different USB ports just for the heck of it. Also, the mouse with the second set tended to sometimes lose the button press or register a double button press, which I didn't experience with the first one I returned. So I am returning this as defective and getting something else as these seem to be plagued with poor quality control.I am really disappointed in the quality. Even the USB transmitter, the metal piece is not glued to the plastic part. When removing it from the USB port, the metal tends to stay inserted while the plastic pulls out, so I had to use a pliers to extract the metal part from my port. This happened with BOTH keyboards I tried. FWIW, these are supposedly designed by Cherry in Germany, but they are manufactured in China. I really expected better than this, given Cherry's reputation and my past experience with their KC 6000 slim keyboard, which was excellent but fell the unfortunate victim of a spill, which prompted me to replace it with this.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

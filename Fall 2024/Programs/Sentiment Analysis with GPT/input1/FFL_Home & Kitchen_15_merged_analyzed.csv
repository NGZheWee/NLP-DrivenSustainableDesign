I guess i'll try 3-4 tomorrow and see how it comes out.I absolutely love Guayaki loose leaf, and so far hate these. Would not recommend.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I was born and raised in Paraguay and it’s extremely insulting to see people appropriating something so sacred to us! First of all IT IS NOT a product from Argentina or Brazil. It was originated in Paraguay during the first big war, where the tribes called Guayakí (emphasized the í) used the leaves of the Yerba mate because of the high hydration properties as they didn’t have access to clean water. Later on it was adopted by other cultures, also big part of Argentina and Brazil used to be all part of Paraguay called “Rio de la plata” under Spain rule. Terere and mate is extremely sacred to Paraguayans and the fact that they're the less credited is extremely insulting! Learn the culture first and they you can use them, we don’t mind you using them for profits but have some respect specially for a country where most people identifies as Guarani ancestry!",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Both of which gives me a powerful jolt of energy, it is more gradual then coffee but for people who don't consume caffeine regularly- you will feel it.I have been trying this on and off for about 2 months now. I can say with confidence that there is little to no caffeine compared to the other versions (same brand) I tried. Normally one tea bag would do the job and wake me up, however I have even used TWO teabags (supposedly 80 MG of caffeine) and feel nothing what-so-ever.The 2 stars are for :-The price point is great, the box of 25 tea bags cost more than this 75 tea bag. (This has me question the product even more)-The taste is relatively the same, if you are in it for the flavor then this works just fine for that.

This five pounds of loose tea is sold for only $.47 an ounce. The cheapest green tea from china sells for $.60, not organic not Fair Trade which makes this tea an excellent healthy option in USDA organic form. Guayusa has a smoother taste than Yerba Mate. Any food item sold directly by Amazon, not a third party means fresh due to high turn over. This is an excellent price especially when competition sells this tea for $9 in a 8oz bag.The first people to discover Yerba Mate were the Guarani (pronounced wa-ra-nee). Their traditional homeland in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil overlaps the home range of wild yerba mate. I was born in a tea family. I drink over ten cups of tea every single day. I have been doing that for decades and decades. USDA organic, a certified USDA, Kosher, Fair Trade. Those three items ORGANIC, KOSHER, FAIR TRADE, guarantee a superior product, fair treatment of workers and environment. I drink many different teas and even the cheapest USDA organic, Kosher but not Fair Trade tea like Davidson's green tea sells for $10 a pound and once again not a Fair Trade ingredient. Amazon has great pricing. To get the most out of my tea, I do not treat these teas like I do with the real expensive teas since I drink so many cups of it every single day. Instead I make these teas in coffee percolator since I like my tea really hot and I hate waste. Percolator get all its colors out but I treat the black tea differently.A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle -- this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling.Remember it is only a tea, there is no antioxidants, no youth, no energy, no nutritious stimulants except caffeine which is natural ingredient and all other miracles claimed by all those producers of Yerba Mate especially WEIGHT LOSS are all marketing tools. The only weight loss that I know of is exercise and cutting calories consumption unless one is truly genetically or chronically sick. These producers need to remove those claims since it is very misleading. Antioxidants are the most misused word in health and diet. There is not even a measurement of such ingredient called antioxidant in any food NUTRITION FACT table. It is a tea not a supplement either. I do not consume prescriptions for any chronic condition, supplements, pills, process foods. Only in US with relaxed laws these producers are allowed such marketing. I drink coffee as well as many black teas and none are supplements either except sugar free drinks. These are five star teas. Support those farmers through Fair trade or Fair for Life, certified programs and get yourself a nature given drink just like other plants that I use as tea when infact others only use as a food ingredient in their cooking but ignore the marketing.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This is where I was first disappointed, the majority of the contents were basically powdered. Yerba Mate should be fine put not powdery. I had to step back because of the plume of powdery dust that filled the air as I was pouring it into my container. Already let down I tried to stay positive and continued on. Next I smelled the Mate like I would with any other type of tea to get more of an appreciation for the tea, again I was disappointed. This did not smell like the typical pure Mate's I get from local and online suppliers. Again, I tried to stay positive and remain hopefully that the taste would be the decider. The following morning I brewed some of the Mate, left it on the light side to make sure that I can fully appreciate the tea and adjust the quantity to my specific taste. Once again I was let down. With all other pure Mate's I have had in the past they had a grassy, light lemony/citrus taste to them (which I love). This has a roasted nutty and dark taste to it, not completely unpleasant but I do not seek out the taste.Overall I am extremely disappointed. The only reason it got a 3/5 instead of 2/5 is because the cost is so cheap that I don't feel like I wasted too much money on it. I would not suggest this product to a friend or family.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I take them to school for situations when I need a caffeine kick (like staying awake in a boring lecture). I bought the loose leaf version because I can control the sugar content of the drink. I found the flavor pleasant and mild. I know some reviewers are complaining about the taste - perhaps they used boiling water to steep the mate. If you use high temperature to steep the drink it will be bitter and awful. Also, some reviewer are complaining of the dusty residue. It does appear a couple of minutes after you steep the mate. It did not really bother me though. I would like to point out the the leaves themselves are not dusty. It's only after you steep them that you'll see the residue. The main issue that I have with the product is it puts me to sleep instead of keeping me awake. I started nodding off 10 minutes after I took the last sip during the first time I drank it. I thought it was an isolated incident then I tried a week after and I had the same result. Maybe the loose leaf version has some compounds that affect me a certain way - it is unfiltered and unrefined compared to the soda version. I'll keep buying the Guayaki soda drink for the caffeine. I just want to share my experience - it might have the same effect on you.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

As a fan of traditional South American beverages, I can attest to the genuine flavor and aroma of this Yerba Mate.The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the tea bags fresh and preserving their flavor. However, the only downside I found was the lack of a string for easy removal of the tea bag. While it's a minor inconvenience, having a string attached would make the brewing process more convenient, especially when using a mug or cup.Overall, I would still highly recommend this Yerba Mate Tea for its taste, quality, and energizing effects. It's a great addition to any tea lover's collection, despite the small drawback of the missing string.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

What I will comment on first is ease of use:  Drop two bags in my large coffee cup put a little water on it then swirl to get the teabags wet (dummy water thing) and let sit for about a minute.  Then put the 170 degree or so water on it.  let it steep.  Enjoy. When you finish, you can put another round of water on it to get a weaker cup (I have gone three rounds on the two bags but prefer to end it at two YMMV).Effects:  As you have read or may not have read, this stuff has a caffeine content above tea but below coffee and has other components involved here as well (Theobromine et.al) so as a life long coffee drinker I can tell you that this will produce a much more elegant buzz that what Mistress Coffee provides.  I feel alert, focused, and very awake without the shakes and stomach upset that coffee sometimes does to the drinker.  I can also tell you that my appetite doesn't go away but I'm not digging thru my desk looking for snack machine change.  I can hold out till lunch.  The after effects are minimal.  I dont crash as hard (if you want to call it crash now) as you do when coffee wears off.  It ""ramps up then gently ramps back down""  Which is why I suppose folks drink the stuff in a weaker form all day long.  You keep getting weaker and weaker doses so that you gently come back down.  Does it have the same ""gotta go to the potty"" effect as coffee...kinda...sorta...not as pronounced.In conclusion:  If you are like me and trying to wean off the coffee and tea just isn't cutting it, this is a very good way to get introduced into the world of yerba mate without all the ritual stuff that you see associated with yerba mate (that slurping sound that is popular with the gourd/bombilla/knit cap in the middle of summer crowd drives me freaking nuts!).  If you like it then you can buy all the stuff and stand on the corner with a gourd or use a french press like I plan on doing.Enjoy your mate.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Their cans of mate are great and I have consumed many of them. I have also recently moved to traditional preparation: using a gourd and bombilla. I think this is fun although you have to get accustomed to the taste which is pretty strong and bitter--at first. However, I have found that the taste is acquired.My wife and I really like mate. Guayaki's products are probably pretty comparable to ""top of the line."" However, there ARE cheaper alternatives like Eco Teas, which is also organic and fair trade (whatever that means ...  I should look it up). I am going to review what I think are the PROS and CONS of mate AS A FORMER ENERGY DRINK CONSUMER (I'll never go back).My OWN experience:PROS--Mental alertness enhanced--Awakens me and actually makes me feel energetic (AS OPPOSED TO jittery and wired)--Enhances my mood. Let me elaborate: I am more introverted than not. When I have consumed some mate I actually feel more positive and inclined to smile and say hi to people, even across a room. I have really liked that.--I feel the claims to ""aids elimination"" are true. Things tend to keep moving as they should!CONS--Makes my urine smell. :) Like unto asparagus, I have noticed that drinking mate adds a certain ... smell ... to urine. Don't get me wrong though, not a big deal! Just kind of funny and would, well, technically fall under ""cons.""--The primary thing: I have seemed to notice that if I go a day and a half or so without drinking it I develop a headache. (I DID NOT personally get this with energy drinks for whatever reason.) I am currently doing a experiment to determine if mate ""withdrawal"" is, in fact, the reason. I'll have to update this later with what I have found.That's the main reason I brought it from five stars down to four. I don't like ANYTHING that creates or causes any form of bodily dependence. I spoke of my headaches to a friend of mine, an avid mate drinker, and he also told me, ""Oh yeah, If I were to stop drinking mate I'd have a headache for a week!""Hope the review helps!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I like tea, but I have never been a fanatic about it. The blog stated that the actual loose tea from South America is both inexpensive and POTENT (meaning strong in the effect) vs. the tea sold in the states. I just looked this up on Amazon, saw this was loose tea, it was only $11 (& change + $5 in S&H) so I gave it a whirl. I brew it in my coffee pot, & I usually will circulate it through twice to increase the strength of it. I'll set it up at night (while I'm awake) & brew the first pot, & then prior to going to bed I put the tea back in the reservoir, & set the ""Brew Delay"" to begin at about 3:45am in the morning before I get up & get ready to go workout. It works well for my digestive system, gives me energy w/out the crash, & I'll add some sugar free French vanilla creamer & Stevia to it sometimes just to give it a little creaminess that makes it ""yummy"" (for me). The downside to brewing this in your coffee pot is that if you fill up your reservoir for 12 cups of coffee - by the time it finishes brewing you will be down to about 10 (I surmise it is due to the absorption from the dry loose tea sitting in the filter). I am on my 2nd bag in less than 2 weeks, but then again, I am quite active and many times I work at a clinic during the day and then out of a fire dpt at night as a Paramedic so I like to sip it throughout the duration of the day (depending on my schedule). It also doesn't give me a ""sour stomach"" (when empty) like coffee does. I'd recommend giving it a try!! ...& the shipping was pretty fast!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Try a smaller count option first if you want to get some mate (you don't want to get stuck with 74 bags of something you hate). If you love mate and don't do loose leaf, this is a great option.For people just getting into mate, this is a great option because it is in bags and not loose leaf. Also good for having some mate at work or on the go because you don't have to have a little gourd stuffed with steaming hot water and a handful of mate with a bombilla.There are better tasting mates out there, but this is a very good option for the price and quantity. 75 bags!? You won't find many options out there with that many bags for this price. They are not individually wrapped, so you might get a little dust from the bag, but that's partly contributed to the lower cost since they don't have to package each little bag. Additionally, the tea bags are just that, tea bags. No strings or little tabs to lift the tea bag out. If you hate that, Guayaki makes individually wrapped tea bags with strings, they're just a little more expensive. Not much though, since Guayaki is the more affordable tea bag option for mate. If you're super serious about mate, loose leaf will always be the cheapest option. I've got a 500 gram bag of Rosamonte that I've been working on for the past 3-4 months at work (at ~3g per serving, that's ~167 servings, 30 servings a month, the bag will last just over 5 months).ProsPrice and quantity are greatTaste is goodBagged, not loose leafConsNo string or tab on the bagsNot individually wrappedNot the greatest mate known to man (but still good)",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I'm normally a strong black coffee drinker and while I continue to prefer coffee as my stimulant of choice, mate is a great change up.  The ""kick"" is a bit more subtle than strong coffee and in my opinion seems to not have some of the less desirable side effects (acid stomach, jitters, etc).

They are separate tea bags in a foil package that keeps them fresh.  I usually use two tea bags when I make my mate, but it still lasts a long time.  The tea tastes great and not bitter.  But of course, it all depends on the brewing time so keep that in mind.  The longer you brew it results in bitterness.  Also, the temperature of water also is a factor that can affect the taste.  I heat the water until its just about to boil.  That is the temperature that prevents the bitter taste.  Try this and enjoy it!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

But this particular type (mate tea bag) is not necessarily my cup-of-tea.  Catch my joke.  Lol.  So far I've tried Cruz de Malta which I love😍 and now Guayaki in tea bag form.  In comparison, I feel as though, I must add 7-8 Guayaki tea bags just to equal strength of one brew from Cruz de Malta.  On my part, I haven't done any digging to see if Guayaki comes in brew form, if so, I'd probably prefer that over the tea bag form.Happy mate drinking everyone!

This had good reviews which is why I chose this brand.I measure my blood sugar often and test what effects various foods and drinks have on it. - I'm prediabetic and trying to reverse it.  If I drink this tea alone on an empty stomach it will lower my blood sugar by approximately 14 points over the course of the following hour from when I first start sipping it.  For example, I would go from 100 down to 86. If I drink it with a meal it seems to suppress my blood glucose values slightly compared to when I eat the same food without drinking the Yerba Mate.I have consumed hundreds of cups over the last year or so and it has never once made me jittery.  The most I would have in a day is probably 2 tea bags.  I typically have 2 cups of decaf coffee first thing in the AM, then I have a cup or two of this tea after that.I will use one bag twice if I am having a second cup right after the first one.  The second cup will obviously be a little weaker but it is still satisfying.The tea seems to help calm me and focus me and help me get into ""the zone"" when I am doing creative work.  The effect is not strong.  It is very subtle.  So, don't drink it expecting a dramatic relaxation effect.I absolutely love the flavor.  It is very mild in my opinion.  To me it seems like the texture of the tea is almost as if you had a very small amount of butter in the tea cup.  (Not the taste of butter - just the texture - like silky almost)  I think it is just lovely.I have not been able to source this locally.  Someone local probably sells it but I haven't found it yet.  So I always buy it through Amazon.  It always arrives promptly in good condition.The large foil bag that these tea bags ship in is easy to tear.  You will probably want to have an airtight container of some kind to store your tea bags in.  The bag they ship in will probably end up tearing wide open on you before you get half way through the bag.I strongly recommend this tea.  Drinking this has become a daily habit for me.  At this point it looks like a permanent habit too assuming the quality never diminishes and assuming the price remains affordable.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's actually related to holly.Second, it contains vitamins, minerals, and more antioxidants than green tea (contrary to one misguided reviewer on here claiming that yerba only yields caffeine, which is not even close to the truth.)Yerba mate contains caffeine, theophylline (vasodilator) and theobromine (found in chocolate), but most who drink it find they do not experience the jitters, acid stomach or other negative aspects of coffee or green tea, myself included.I have found that yerba acts as a natural asthma medication for me, keeping my lungs open and giving me an energetic boost without feeling hyper, sweaty or keeping me from sleeping. In fact, I often take yerba before bed to keep the lungs happy all night and sleep like a baby. I cannot consume coffee or any tea (black or green) after noon and sleep at all, not even one cup. So clearly yerba is a special herb.It brews well in tea bags, in a traditional gourd and bombilla setup or in a French press.  Apparently in South America, they have it cold and brewed in fruit juice and similar things for a refreshing summer beverage. I cannot wait to try that! I've made yerba overnight in the fridge, cold-brewed, and it was delicious. Strong, but not bitter at all.Just wanted to correct some misinformation on here and share some of the reasons why yerba mate has been a treasured part of my life for 3 decades and counting!Original Review:I was introduced to Guayaki Yerba Mate by a tenant of mine in Los Angeles. He used to chuck a few tea bags into his 1.5 liter water bottle, shake it up and sipped it throughout the day for energy and the lovely flavor. I tried it and have been a huge devotee ever since. I like it sweetened with a touch of liquid stevia and I brew mine quite strong (so strong, you cannot see through the water, lol) because I adore the rich, smokey flavor which only seems to deepen when you add a little sweetness. I also noticed that while I do feel a little energy lift from it, I never feel jittery nor has it ever disrupted my sleep when I drink it in the evening. It honestly seems to help my digestion as well, I feel like it kindles the digestive flames somehow, but that might just be my own experience.Wonderful flavor, unobtrusive energy and a healthy substitute for coffee or ""energy drinks"".",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I also purchased some Red Rooibos as well to compare the two. I have to say that while I did enjoy the Red Rooibos, it had that very distinct tea flavor, and just didn't quite hit the spot.The Yerba Mate came in a few days later, so yesterday was the first time I got to try it as a morning coffee substitute. While again, it's not going to taste like coffee, this stuff was much more like green tea, which isn't bad either, but definitely not like coffee.  I normally add a bit of heavy cream to my coffee, so I did that as well, and found I enjoyed it much more that way.Claims that the smaller amount of caffeine being enough (95mg in coffee vs 40mg in this product), held true for me, as well as the claim that it felt more like a consistent energy, rather than the hard hit that coffee can give, and then fades.Yesterday I had to get up at 5:30 am and drive 2 hours to get to a 4 hour conference. I then had to run a bunch of errands, followed by a 2 hour drive home. After 6 hours of sleep, things didn't seem promising. However, I found that I really wasn't very tired at all throughout the day, and it wasn't until around 3-4, after eating a solid meal, that I kind of started feeling the energy drain, but I was still pretty good all the way up to my evening exercises, after which, I just crashed, but it was 10 pm by then.So, given the initial trial run, I'd say the Yerba Mate IS a good substitute. Granted, it could be a whole fluke of a day, but for now, my opinion is that the taste is pleasant, and the slow and steady energy buzz is actually preferable to coffee. As far as claims of being a mild appetite suppressant, I haven't noticed that.Just a final heads up: a quick Google shows that there's a lot of pros and cons about Yerba Mate, including that it's better for you than coffee, with lots of vitamins and nutrients and anti inflammatory effects,  but also studies saying it can put you at a higher risk for some cancers if too much is ingested. I honestly haven't looked very far into it, but will be doing so once I'm done with this. Just so you know!UPDATE: Oct. 7, 2019 - Yerba Mate has consistently held up as a caffeine substitute for me. I now drink 2 tea bags added to 16 oz hot water and about 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream in the morning. My energy levels are comparable to coffee, and I'm usually not hungry till 11-12pm. I got this because it's not supposed to stain your teeth like coffee does, and I can say my teeth haven't stained any.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

And that this could POTENTIALLY mean bad news for bones, teeth, and brain function.  I will leave you to do your own research on that, as I am generally NOT a worrier about such things (so I know how frustrating it is to hear yet another possible health risk.)  Still (obviously) I saw enough reason to be at least ""concerned"" at the levels of fluoride in black and green (and decaf) tea.  This led me to two new products: White Tea and Yerba Mate.Yerba Mate is a loose leaf traditional (south american) tea-like product that comes in many different forms.  And it doesn't have high concentration of fuoride in its leaves.  So, I tried it.I heard that it tastes ""grassy"" or like hay.  Some say it taste earthy.  To be sure, it doesn't taste like green or black tea (but more like green than like black).  It is unique.  I didn't find it ""grassy.""  I found it to have a pleasant, non-bitter taste.  Not like tea, as I said, but pleasant enough.I prepared it by putting it in my Mr. Coffee coffemaker.  FIrst batch tasted like coffee a bit.  I cleaned the coffee maker and tried again.  This time i got a pleasant brew.  I tried to make it STRONGER, the next time and I found no real difference.  So, I went back to normal brew.  It will look a little like green tea in looks, but it's unique taste was unmistakeable. I enjoyed it. My wife complained it had an odd taste.  However, my wife is self-proclaimed picky eater.  Even if she loves some recipe/item, then later finds out it has XYZ (whatever item she doesn't think she likes) then see will change her mind and never eat that food that she said that she loved.  All that to say this: If you are AOK with knowing this will have a unique taste, then you may just find it a good drink for you. If you are pretty picky about tastes that are new, then you likely will not like it.For me, I have to give it 5 stars.  Oh, to be sure, I like White Tea better than Yerba Mate, but it is a good product and worthy of 5 stars.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

He bought the stuff as an iced tea from Whole Foods. I tried it and it did provide an energy boost, but not a ""crazy"" one.After some research, I found out that as a ballpark figure, Yerba Mate provides ~1/3 (one third) of the caffeine of a cup of coffee. That's perfect for me, since I don't always want as much caffeine as a full cup of coffee, but I do want *some.* I did some research, and it turns out they don't just sell it at Whole Foods in pre-made iced tea. So I bought it on Amazon.== Taste ==Yerba Mate has a smoky flavor to it. If you like drinking green tea or other teas without adding lots of sugar, you'll like this tea.== Price point ==... is absolutely ridiculous -- you get 75 tea bags. That lasts a long time.== No string attached ==If it's an issue for you, the tea does come in bags, but it doesn't have a string for easily pulling out the bag. It's really not very difficult to pull it out with a spoon, but it is worth mentioning since most people are used to having a string attached to their tea bags.== Good hot or cold ==At first, I had this tea mostly hot-brewed, and it was quite good. But recently, my girlfriend and I have started adding about 5-10 bags to a large pitcher of water and letting it soak in the fridge for at least 12 hours. It tastes **awesome.** So while Yerba Mate is good for hot tea, it is even better for cold tea. Some teas just taste better cold -- actually, that's true of food in general. Some things taste better hot; some better cold. Black tea is the one most commonly used in iced teas, like Snapple. You can drink it warm, but it's far more popular cold.I highly recommend this product, and I also highly recommend that you try using it to brew iced tea.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After having downed energy drinks twice a day for a few years, switching to coffee to try to get an equal, albeit uneven, fix, I'm happy to have found yerba mate tea.What I love most about the Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea is the elevated feel and focus the tea provides through its 40 mg of caffeine per bag without the traditional shaky hands and anxiety I would get from coffee and energy drinks. It's a buzz without being a wreck.For comparisons, Starbucks coffee (venti Americano) doses you with about 300 mg of caffeine though independent reports I've seen have shown it to be upwards of 400 mg+ depending on where you go. Energy drinks typically range from 77 mg (8 oz Red Bull) to 240 mg per can (16 oz Rockstar Zero Carb) with added, and unnecessary to get you going, things like taurine that are questionable for your health.With yerba mate tea, you can stack your caffeine to your content. Want the buzz of an energy drink without the nerves? Put four bags in and let it steep for 10 minutes. Works like a charm every time for me.It's worth noting that the U.S. government recommends not consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine per day so going overboard with two ventis from Starbucks or two Rockstars can have potential consequences. Beyond the simple enjoyable taste of yerba mate, the stackable nature is what I enjoy most.For the price, you can't go wrong! Four bags (160 mg of caffeine) gets you close to 19 cups of tea.

I used to brew him other brands of Yerba Mate teas when we lived in San Francisco but could not find any strong ones in our area of Sam diego now . After looking around I came across this loose leaf tea one and honestly it’s been great , the taste is strong and not flavorful  as the Can ones but it also does not say it is lol , what I do is buy sweet flavor loose teas at my local farmers market that don’t have caffeine so I don’t add more and give the man a heart attack , also can use tea puches and ass a bit of honey or sugar to each it’s own for some sweetness . Works great and he has more flavor options than the canned ones , also Have the option to make it as strong or light  as he wants with many different flavor options , make a big pitcher that last all week and is ready to make it iced in a hydro flask . Overall GREAT purchase , money saver .",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green ""tea"" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland.

I prepare it by heating up water then throwing 1-2 packets into my giant mug, then slowly stir it for about 2-3 minutes.  My first few sips of it weren’t bad, but not great.  Overtime though I did like the grassy/earthy taste it has.  Noticeably different than any other varieties of tea I’ve ever had!  If you’re not into such a strong taste, try diluting it a bit!Whenever I drink Yerba Mate Tea I definitely notice a decent boost of mental clarity, but different than if I were to just drink a ton of coffee and get a huge rush from the caffeine.  Furthermore since there is much less caffeine in Yerba Mate Tea (40mg) compared to coffee (100-120mg) I don’t ever experience a crash from the caffeine and I feel alright drinking this at night and not have to worry about staying up all night.For 75 bags the price isn’t too shabby, but if you’re strictly after caffeine content I probably look to a combination of coffee and green / black tea for the best bang for your buck.  As for those seek a little more variety in their caffeine, this is a wonderful selection!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

When my coffee consumption started to get out of hand, I was looking for an alternative that didn't leave me crashing in the afternoon. A friend suggested I try Yerba tea because it has been around for hundreds of years, is a natural source of caffeine, has digestive benefits, all without the afternoon crash.  At the time, I could only find Yerba tea in health food stores. Each time I ran out of a box (usually around 20 tea bags), I would have to trek to the store for more. I'm not a fan of the Yerba teas with added stevia, vanilla, or the ""smoked"" flavor. When I found this Guayaki brand on amazon, I thought 75 tea bags for $11 would certainly sacrifice flavor for cost. But I was wrong! I love the tea - and it has successfully kept me from returning to my coffee over-addiction :)  The tea steeps for about 5 minutes. I put the tea bag into my mug and use my Keurig machine for instant hot water. I like to add some honey, and occasionally some milk or cream. By itself, it can be a little strong on an empty stomach, but green tea is also too strong for me on an empty stomach. I never have that coffee crash, and my mind actually feels clearer than with coffee.I would highly recommend this Guayaki Yerba Mate tea - for the taste & for the money! It's a great deal!!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Bear McBear,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2013","For $11.25 or 15 cents per packet at time of purchase for a total of 75 bags of tea this is a great deal.When I look for tea I generally look for three things: price, taste, and health benefits. Guayaki Yerba Mate tea is very cheaply priced online as described earlier and all you have to do is walk the aisles at your grocery store to see that. In terms of taste, it is actually derived from a plant of the same name in South America and is actually a species of Holly. It is somewhat like an earthier green tea with a slight (pleasant) bite depending on how you brew it.Health wise, I drink it every morning and it helps wake me up without the rise and fall that regular coffee provides, and like most fresh brewed hot tea I find it personally mellows me out and helps me get ready to face the challenges of the day. Additionally, it has helped regulate my digestion and overall just made me feel slightly better overall. When I got a head cold a steaming cup of Yerba Mate helped clear up my sinuses although I've found most hot teas will do the same, though I will qualify these statement with the fact that I am not a doctor and haven't done any studies, these are just my personal observations.I definitely plan on rebuying this tea when my current supply runs out.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I am one of the few that caffeine does not cause sleeplessness in, thankfully.The flavor of Yerba Mate is very refreshing and similar to a green tea yet does not give the flavor of the grassy flavor much like a sencha green tea.If you are watching the calories and crave the chocolate euphoria this will fulfill that craving without the calories as well as give you a nice pick me up.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and ""on edge"" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in

Lately, we have been using this loose leaf mate exclusively as our first tea of the morning, and, prior to any coffee. I really like the flavor -- rich and full. If there's more left, as usually the case in the glass pot I use, I pour over more hot water, use this way -- and/or use the leftovers to make a great iced tea, sweetened or unsweetened. I find that mate' is far gentler on my stomach and likewise, on the nervous system, than our good ol' coffee we love. Have reduced my coffee from two to one rich cup later in morning. By the way, I've tried other brands of mate' over the years -- anyway, a few -- and keep coming back to this.

I started drinking it to replace coffee about 6 months ago and this stuff is beyond what I expected. I've even managed to lose about 10 lbs because of it! It keeps me awake and active through the day without the uncomfortable jitters and sugar crashes that came as a result of over consumption of coffee. I've tried two different brands now and guayakí is my favorite so far. If you have never tried it I suggest trying it in a can before you dive in and buy the loose leaf. The loose leaf is by far the better value (even better than the tea bags) but has a little more of an earthy flavor. I've never been a huge fan of tea but I can't get enough of this stuff. It is seriously the best. If you are skeptical please take this review as your extra push to give it a try you won't regret it!!,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I have been an avid coffee drinker for over a decade, and as I have gotten older it has started to give me some stomach issues due to it's acidity. I was looking for a switch because I still love having a cup of something warm in the morning. This was the perfect substitute as it also gave me a bit of a caffeine kick.To brew I use my coffee maker like normal but don't put any coffee beans in. I put a travel mug underneath with two bags and set the alarm for the AM. I let it steep for 10 minutes or so then add a bit of agave and lemon. Easy on the stomach, tastes great, gives me a caffeine kick and I know I am getting a bunch of antioxidants in the morning.

From what I've read the chemical make up is different in Yerba Mate (YM) compared to caffeine in other drinks.What I absolutely love about YM is that it gives a slight energy boost & even a happiness without the jittery feeling & you won't have a crash after an hour or so as with regular caffeinated drinks. Don't misunderstand though, it doesn't bring you up if you are sad. I've tried triple doses to test this but on a regular day it adds a bit of a skip to your step. :)The flavor isn't much to be desired but add a little local honey (which is extremely good for fighting allergies) & it will grow on ya.I do not ever want to be without my YM.

Usually when I wake up I drink it hot with no sugar, and it gives me a nice boost in the day without giving me a jittery feeling.  When it's hot, I make a pitcher of this iced, with sugar, a spoonful of rosewater, and a squeeze of lime. Yeah, it's not traditional at all, but it is so good! :)This package contains 75 teabags.  The bags don't have strings and are not individually packaged, which I like because it cuts down on waste.  If you know what mate tastes like and drink it regularly, this is an economical purchase.  If you haven't tried mate before, I'd suggest getting a smaller sized pack at first because it doesn't taste like tea.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I use it occasionally in place of coffee. It may be an acquired taste, as it taste like liquid grass from your yard to me. However I steep two bags in a cup of hot water for several minutes. Squeeze out the water and add a little bit of milk. The Taste is not terribly objectionable it's just different. However the desired effect for me is to have a caffeine boost or a little bit of stimulant boost. This will do that because it has caffeine in it, however the way it works is not the sudden onset of the jitters like a strong cup of coffee can do. This is more gradual and without really a crash when it wears off. So I highly recommend that you try it and see how it works for you.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I would happily drink it any time or day, and it might even start to push my old favorite Early Grey out on occasion.Vanilla chai is excellent for warm pick me ups in place of earl grey",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Unglaublich, sowas überhaupt als Teemischung anzupreisen... Und an der Haltbarkeit mag es nicht liegen: die geht bis 2018!Könnte auch warmes Wasser mit einem Teelöffel herkömmlichen Pfefferminztees verdünnt trinken und es wäre dasselbe! ^^ Eigentlich eine Frechheit!Bin recht enttäuscht, denn ich hatte mich nach Lesen der einzigen Kundenrezension sehr auf diesen Tee gefreut... :(Ich werd' die Packung entsorgen, so eine laffe Plörre (und ich hatte ihn extra konzentriert aufgegossen!) hab ich noch NIE als Minze-Tee getrunken!!!Sogar ein billiger Aldi-Pfefferminztee schmeckt dagegen herausragend und kräftig!(Kann mich gar nicht genug aufregen.)Fazit: NIE WIEDER und diese Marke werde ich in Zukunft generell meiden!Keine Empfehlung, kann nur abraten, sich diesen Beutel-""Tee"" (übrigens auch mit wenig Inhalt pro Beutel!) zu kaufen!",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

It's not overly ""minty""; no overwhelming peppermint taste, and a lovely separmint taste left after you drink it. Not to mention, it's great for an upset stomach.Add a little creamed honey if you want a dessert-like taste. By the way, the other Pukka teas are quite tasty too.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We have tried various brands and types of mint teas, and have found this Pukka blend of mints (organic peppermint, spearmint, and field mint) to be the VERY best of them all!  This tea has not only helped her with tummy pains, but if any of our family of 10 gets sick with stomach pains that is typically one of the first things we use!

I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I decided to try this as an alternative and I find that I like it just as well, if not a little more, at a 1/3 of the cost. It is my FAVORITE tea flavor. The notes of both peppermint and licorice are noticeable, but not overpowering. I like it because it's a tad sweet and satisfies my sweet tooth rather than eating something I shouldn't. People think it sounds like a nasty combination, but it's fantastic! Try it. You may be pleasantly surprised.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I observed Latex Production in my teens,it should be like a car tire rubber with less  Durometer of hardness because Tires are made to endure roads/streets,etc.,not sleep on.Latex should be resilient,firm,rubber like,yet tender,(Not pasta to the tooth al dente)giving to a point,(Yet nothing of the sinking of memory foam I dislike),firm more than expensive leather couch padding,(Ok for a brief period,yet not too decent for sleeping on a lot.) Latex is the opposite of the cheap,airy,not even Polyurethane or latex foam they sent,I am insulted for myself and the unwary,as the reviews I read should have warned me,they almost did,especially the complaints of how it's like a no support foam,which is exactly what it is.I worked making furniture a year or 2 in my teens and at 20,this ""latex"" is super cheap foam,a joke,considered as only one or two of the many layers (They would be firmer for the middle inner of a mattress,than this rip off foam,though.)in making beds,needed near the top layer under the covering and stitching,I would choose a dry very stiff thin foam layer,direct under the outer cover,then this foam,it cannot really be noticed,it flattens immediately like nothing there,though helps protect the covering,it must be protected from underneath,a matress made like this can last for many years without flattening too much,I learned this from one of the best Mattress Makers,thats how she learned,after High School.This ""latex"" is about what I just mentioned,the most cheapest, unsupporting foam ever,not even worth maybe $2.00,about what I paid for it then while making matresses,at 1"" thick,twin size.(I thought it reminded me of something,even my first job stocking in a corner store for ""Umpteen"" $ a week,whats that mean,I asked.$13.00,I was told,the first teen after $12.00,your'e only 10 years old,just a child.(Ha-ha,I'm amused nowadays,I did not think it was funny then.Hard to forget.Not exactly big $,boy,did I work hard all my life.)Latex is the best I have had,(Except for air matresses,if they wouldn't flatten,a bunch cheap and expensive went in the trash,not really worth the $.)first Dunlop,which can smell,the plastic helps,then Talalay,which smells less,(Talalay is better,as the refining process is better and more cost to make than Dunlop,do not let anybody lie to you.)the reverse of any latex is bad,if the under matress is not of enough firmness,the latex on top is not supported enough.Expect splits in about a year anyway on either choice,D or T,placed on a hard board,or however,glues do not work too decent,tapes are better.Personally,I wrap my matresses,pillows and toppers in 6ml plastic,use enough to place mattress flat,bring over and beyond top,about a foot beyond,cut to match,or one an inch or so short,black Gorilla tape Tough and Wide(Better than other colors,worth the $15.00 or so.),tape so seam is in middle or so,fold and press,bring up on mattress,press and try to eliminate space,tape again,seam to matress,I use many small peices to shorten up any billowing,a small hole,(You usually do not need to,when you try it out,it'll pop,you may need a small peice of tape if too big,leave a tiny opening.)Do this first before wrapping a comforter around mattress and topper,(Topper is,of course,already on mattress top.),and hold comforter with under straps,though straps can and do break.The comforter stops much of the hot/cold/stick/noise problem,as it is thick enough to,hell,the comforter themselves doubled,2 can provide 4 plush layers,making your own topper,adjustable,the bargain ones at Departyment Stores are worth it here,way better than useless foam.(The ""useless"" foam is needed in bed making though,as the 2nd layer under the stiff styrofoam like layer just under the stitched covering must have this foam next,or the matress swiftly chaps,the next 10 or so layers are of varying foams,etc.,adjusted to the vare of firmness,etc.)A fitted sheet can work to hold comforter smoothly.Attach the straps to that,as the thickness of comforters tends to break the holders on straps.The comforter can be used a long time before washing,the 6ml plastic virtually water/dust proofs it,a spills a pain,at least the plastic can be damp wiped.I do not eat or drink on my matresses anymore,rare.I keep one comforter ready/stored for that reason,air tighted is best,or chew throughs can occur,they do not know what food is anyway.The pillow(s) need a zip case or 2,works better than 2 pillow cases,with 2nd one reversed,sticking to plastic is to be avoided.This ""Latex""rip off (I thought the name was funny.) is not even latex foam they sent for 137.79 twin size,with 4 year warranty,they claim it is natural latex,(No way!Real Latex is like actual flexible rubber.),and upon unwrapping,I felt and knew immediately what it is,a rip off.A lot of people do not know latex,having never seen it made,it is liquid rubber from a rubber tree,processed shaped,mixed sometimes,like Talalay, and cured in a form,so if that expensive latex topper or mattress cost x amount of $ to make,make sure to get the warranty,worth every penny,as they still make a profit from the cost of the warranty alone,it covers the obtaining and production,all ""Overhead.""Though everything must break, eventually,it cost minimal,or not at all,if so many acres of rubber trees are owned,#100,00 plus matresses can be made first,before machines break,what's 10 or $20,000 to fix a roller,(How expensive,compared to making many millions for a rip off.)thats what ruins existence,owners can have millions of $$ and more in their accounts,the next person's on welfare or ssi,or slave to a clock,not exactly because they want to be.(Yeh,charge thousands for something that costs $67.00 to make,overhead and all,not available to the Public.)Manufacturers,which are usually the Farm owners or source from etc.,think we are chattle.Well,though I consider I am my own person,they got enough $ to keep me poor,flattening my meager wallet condescendingly,they have too much $$, and do not share the land and resources properly,this Earth's a shame.Well,anywho,personally,I consider the Martha Stewart firm foam core pillow slight better than even shredded latex for a pillow,which is better than the whole latex pillow for me,though know I slept on a hard floor till I was 17.How cold,with just a bed sheet under me,it made me hard,though I grew up poor.Now I am 60,and not so hard anymore.It's always one thing or the other,if the water heater does not break,($14,000 plus,they wanted,I fixed it myself for less than $400.00,which includes $350. or so for a 40 gallon Electric hot water heater,just right for one person.),I gotta go up on the roof,though I got bunches more down time now,with time running out,now I gotta rewrap/return after waiting for delivery.I do not appreciate the excruciation and wall of ignorance on almost every product.Thank you.Mike",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

It arrived and it IS and still IS AMAZING! So comfortable! ZERO smell, a wonderful topper! I bought the TWIN size topper as a topper for my sectional sofa (I have an amazingly comfortable mattress) because I have Lyme disease and my bones, muscles and joints hurt when I lay down and put any kind of pressure on them. I found such amazing relief w this product that I ordered another one on June 21st, 2024 for the other side of my sectional so I could sit and lay on either side free of pain. Well, I was traveling and delayed opening the box to get the second topper set up until last night Aug 14,2024. Way past my return window. Thus, being angry at myself… This new topper literally STINKS like a SKUNK! It has the most DISGUSTING odor! I mean RANK! I am beyond shocked that two identical toppers can arrive in identical packaging from the same company YET be of extreme difference in quality! I paid such a high price because it is a natural organic latex! There is NOTHING NATURAL about my second topper and it had to be carried out of the house into the garage until trash day! Highly disappointed!",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

It is not comfortable at all to me. I've purchased 2 different memory foam toppers and I sink into both of them and get ""stuck"" in the middle of the night.  THen I purchased 2 egg crate toppers and they were a joke. I researched so long and hard trying to decide what to do and what to buy. I need softness, alot of give, in order to be comfortable while still being supportive. I'm a side sleeper. I really believed this was the answer. I bought the 2"" queen ""soft"". I almost bought the ""medium"" thinking the soft was going to be too soft and not enough support, but being a side sleeper I thought I needed the softness so I took a gamble and spent the money on this topper. (It's alot for a topper in my opinion so I didn't make this purchase without alot of consideration).  I was so excited to receive it, unpack it and heave it on the bed. Not an easy task for a 55 year old woman with bad arthritis and alot of pain in shoulders, elbows and wrists from tendonitis. I laid on it............it felt really firm to me, no soft feeling at all. I even wondered if maybe I was sent the firm by mistake, but I thought probably not, they don't make mistakes like that. The disappointment was extreme as this was barely even a little softer than my regular memory foam mattress. The only good thing is the bed is 2"" higher, but I didn't need to spend almost $200.00 for that. I'm so disappointed and dont know what to try now. I feel like i'm never going to be comfortable again because I don't even want to keep trying products only to be disappointed then go thru the hassle of returning them, it's not even worth it anymore. I suffer from menopausal hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain and insomnia now........so atleast being comfortable at night while im dealing with all of this was EXTREMELY important to me.......i'm just crushed.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I have successfully purchased and slept on latex mattress in the past and sold them with my prior house, so decided to get another one for my new place. After getting this mattress, I tried sleeping on it, but it had too many toxic off-gasses.  So, I spent a couple of weeks having it outside to off-gas, and also every day would spend three minutes to fold it up into a 12 inch pad for the chair, and sat on it up and down, up and down, over and over, making it breath in the fresh air and breath out the toxic air.  (The neighbors did stare sometimes as I know I must have looked funny).  But it still had a heavy odor.Plan B:  I took put it in the bath tub with 1/3 a bottle of liquid dish soap and did the ""crush-the-grapes"" walk on it for over an hour.  It took that long to get most of the soap out of it.  Then put it outside to dry for two days.I put it back on the bed and Viola! I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible smell... every time I would roll over, it would squeeze the bad gasses out of the topper and I could not get back to sleep... I tried for an hour... then finally took it off and in the morning got rid of it.Now I am a guy... meaning we are not very sensitive...  so I do not say this lightly, that I really could not sleep with the odor.  Now there are many good reviews, so I do not know if they changed the chemicals they used to create the topper, or if the topper is now a composite of latex and memory foam (which I have tried before, and it had way too much odor to keep)... anyways it is unbearable for me.  I am giving it a single star because it was unusable for me.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I returned the first item, but it was a few years ago, so when I ordered a topper recently, I did not realize I had ordered from them before. The first time the 2"" latex topper was way too soft.  This time I ordered a 1"" soft topper for my otherwise way too firm bed. For some reason Amazon won't let me update the purchase I made this time to reflect the actual item I am reviewing.  I had read reviews about the smell, but figured the reviewers were just unfamiliar with the sometimes initially strong smell of natural latex.I was wrong. Something is not right with this topper. When I opened the plastic, the smell was not THAT strong, though it was noticeable. When I went to bed that night, it was very noticeable, and did not smell anything like any of the natural latex mattresses or toppers I've owned.  All of those had a sweet, rubbery smell. This smells like cigarettes. That is not a natural latex smell.  I thought maybe it would go away after a bit. However, I went out of town for 4 days after spending only one night on this topper. When I got home, the topper had been on my bed for 5 days total and all my linens, including my comforter and my pillows, had the gross cigarette-like smell.I don't know what they are putting in this latex, but it's not right, and I can't imagine it's natural. Either that or they have a factory that allows smoking. NO joke. I am returning and will be buying a new topper elsewhere.Also, the topper arrived compressed, as they all do, but when this one was opened, there were deep groove/impressions in it. The impressions did not go away after decompression. They can actually be seen through my sheets.  That's odd. I don't know if they had this thing packed up for years in a smoky warehouse or what, but I've not had any new latex slabs arrive with permanent dips/grooves in them. I would not purchase from this company again. Too many sketchy issues.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I got this back in feb or march and the smell lessened over time but here it is almost October and the thing still stinks. Originally I thought it lessened because I covered it with a plastic protector and a mattress pad but I recently replaced the old mattress and those don’t fit it so I just have the sheet between me and it. It permeates the sheets and me. UGH!Original review: This definitely had a strong smell for at least 3-4 months. The smell recently stopped thankfully. Otherwise it’s good. My mattress is old and was soft when I bought it (not firm). I hated that I would sink like 4 inches in it. When I got this it felt wonderful to lay on but I’d wake up with horrible back pain. That was because my mattress was still too soft for me. The topper helps with sinking but it doesn’t fix all of it because the mattress under it still sinks. Another reviewer recommended flipping pillow top mattresses over if it was to soft. I did that got rid of my pain. There was still some sinkage from the mattress so I had to shove a blanket under the mattress that fixed all my issues. Now about the smell, that was seriously unpleasant. When I unpacked the topper I left the room and went into a room across the hall to work. A while later I noticed my nose was stuffed up. I didn’t think of the topper. Later I went into the hall to go to the bedroom and noticed it smelled and the hair seemed heavy. When I got in the bedroom it was hard to breathe. I opened the window and left it open. That night I put a plastic mattress cover and a thick mattress protector and sheets over it and I could still smell it. The smell was strong for about 3 weeks and I could smell it when I would roll over and on my skin for about 3-4 months.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I purchased the 3-inch soft in a twin xl size as my husband did not want any change to his side. It was thicker than 3 in and while it did seem to help my back a little it was just too thick and I felt like I sunk too far into it. I also did not like the three inch height difference on the mattress between my side and his. So I returned it and ordered a 2 inch king size soft instead. The first two nights I felt like I slept better after that my back pain returned and upon pulling the sheets off and inspecting it I discovered it already had dips in it where he and I slept. It cost way too much money to already have dips after a few days. The area with the dips did not have the support that the rest of it did when I pressed down with my hand. I was very disappointed as I had hoped that latex would hold up years unlike memory foam. I returned the king as well.I also noticed a very strong latex smell with both of these I have asthma and tend to be more sensitive to smells than most. The smell did not bother my husband but it gave me a sick headache.,-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

The holes in the pictures don't go all the way through, which initially is why I bought it hoping it would breath better than a foam mattress topper. It falls apart from touching it or trying to position it in any way. As for using as a mattress topper, it's not supportive enough to make any real difference. The worst part is the smell. Others have mentioned that you can air it out for a few days, but the smell never got any better. My whole bedroom stinks of this material, and I prematurely threw away the box so I can't return it (not that I would have been able to compress it back in there anyhow).

I've had it for over a year and the noxious fumes are every bit as strong as when I bought it. And minimizing the degree of offgassing is nothing short of deceiving.tl;dr: this was a waste of $300.I've had this mattress pad for over six months now. I used it for five days and it was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the latex smell is so intense that it was making me sick. I've kept it in a shed since then and I put it in the sun for days, but it's every bit as intense now as it was at the beginning. I know from experience that many things that I buy may cause problems for me, so it's something that I have to live with. One way that I get around it is that I read about products in advance. When it comes to latex mattress products, all of the manufacturers that I've seen will go to great pains to state how the smell of their products is minimal and “sweet” smelling (FYI: the fact that the smell is sweet does not lessen any ill effects that it may have). The reason why they do this is because they're trying to rightfully distinguish their natural products from the synthetically-polluted products of their competitors. In the process though, they misrepresent the truth: these mattress products produce a gas that is VERY intense. Many people won't be bothered by it, but other people are.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Candace Lillis,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020","I purchased this to see if it would help me to sleep cooler and ease pressure points on a new mattress that was just feeling too hard.Based on the reviews I expected this to accomplish both.To be fair it did help with the softness factor- it has a strange ""bowl full of jelly"" feel to it that was not bad-just a bit strange. I could have easily  lived with that.What I could not bear was the heat! This made me much hotter than the memory foam topper I purchased to replace it. It actually appeared to store my body heat and reflected it all right back even through a cooling mattress cover and bamboo sheets. It does not sleep cool...not at all.Perhaps the worst thing though was the stench. I aired it out for 48 hours before putting it on the bed under the cooling mattress cover and the fitted bamboo sheet. Even though the worst of the smell off gassed while we aired it out-two weeks later I still got a whiff of the stench every time I pulled the sheets back each night and caught a bit more of it each time I tossed or turned to escape the heat build up.The smell was strong enough that it even bothered my husband.I had to return it.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I've owned multiple mattress toppers over the years from down filled to fiber filled and this was by far the worst investment of $149 I've ever made.  First, the topper was too large for our queen mattress so the sheets wouldn't stay on the bed plus it is cut square so there is all this extra latex at the corners that doesn't fit into the bottom sheet.  More important however is that this topper is so soft it made our back problems ten time worse, to the point we couldn't stand or walk when we first got out of bed.  If you are looking for a super soft bed topper that you sink into and that provides zero support, this is the product you want.  If however, you are looking for any form of back relief or support in a bed topper look elsewhere because this one provides none.  We have taken it off the bed and I'll probably just have to throw it in the garbage because it's too heavy and bulky to store anywhere.

I have been covering it with several sheets to try to help with the hot sleeping part and cover the latex but it is just not working out for me.  I am considering another mattress cover to put over it because it does help with my pain but I am not sure it it will help.  I do notice that when I am gone camping for a week or so I do not have the rash problem so I am pretty sure it is the mattress or the baking soda stuck in the mattress.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

We purchased it a few months before trying it, and then found out it was way too soft, especially for 2 people sleeping in it. It gave me backaches and I was sore every morning.I gave it time to see if I would adjust to it, but I did not.So I tried to contact the seller, and ask if we could get one that was much more firm. I never heard back, and unfortunately, the window for return has passed... the $200 topper is still here, but not being used. I would be happy if they would offer an exchange for a topper that was more dense and supportive.NEW UPDATE:: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!We heard from the CEO who took care of the issue. He is sending a box to send it back, and has refunded what we paid, and will have his team give us better advice on what topper to buy next time. FANTASTIC TO SEE THIS CONCERN FOR THE CUSTOMER.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I'm so disappointed in this product, it actually gives me anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.  We purchased the 2"" soft topper for our queen size extra-firm mattress.  The mattress is only a year old, and high quality, but it was making my shoulders sore.  We chose to try this latex topper instead of memory foam because we didn't want to sleep hot, and didn't want the feeling of sinking into memory foam, struggling to turn over.  To our  dismay, this latex topper makes absolutely no difference in the comfort of our bed.  None.  My shoulders are still killing me.  Even worse, this topper overwhelmingly reeks of rubber.  We aired it out for a day before using it.  It's been on our bed now for well over a month, and the smell has not dissipated at all.  The rubber odor is absolutely overwhelming.  I feel like it's ruined our bed.  Sure wish I could return this thing.  Heed my warning:  Do not buy it!!!",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

And we also smell like burnt rubber in the morning when we get up. I wish I had returned it but I thought that surely the smell would fade. No. It seems as strong as the week we first got the thing. Also, this is my second 3"" latex topper (the other one I bought 10 years ago from a different seller) and this one is less supposed to be 3"" but is actually less than 3"" and just seems to be overall inferior. It doesn't give as much support and cushion as our other one, though they are supposed to be the same in terms of what they are, how thick, and how plush. I think this is just a cheap item, cheaply made, and probably incorrectly made (hence the burnt lingering smell).",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I smell so strongly like chemicals that it’s 1 am and I’m about to shower to get it off my skin. What’s more alarming is that for the past year my mouth has felt like sandpaper in the morning and since we’ve changed our mattress that has gone away.

Ramos,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2018",I’ve been reading up on the best toppers for mattresses and came across latex toppers. I had a memory foam one from bed bath and beyond which I’ve had for 3 years and wasn’t bad at all but after all my research latex was considered to be better. So I spent a little more and got this one and I regret it. I’ve had this one for 2 years and it’s heavy and has two huge dents in it I guess from our bodies. I didn’t think this topper was capable of that. I thought after spending the money on a “latex topper” it would somewhat help with aches and pains (i’m Only 38) but i got the opposite effect. The memory foam one was so much better. The latex comes off easy whenever I have to move my bed around or flip the topper because of the dents. I didn’t like it one bit and regret buying it.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

But, I would buy something softer next time. The one I bought is not quite enough to relieve compressing one's upper arm/shoulder when sleeping on the side. This latex is indeed a bit springier than memory foam as reported on various reviewing sites. This might make it better for sex?Later editing:I thought I had bought the medium firmness one. But, after checking again, it seems that I did buy the soft version. So, this company can't make anything softer.... Well, it's not soft enough to relive pressure points. I do have a cheaper memory foam topper from JCPenney (Isotonic IsoCool which I bought at a gamble before I found The Wirecutter review site) for comparison. I like the memory foam better.I'll note that I did buy the 2'' latex topper while I'm comparing it with a 3'' memory foam. Maybe it's not a fair comparison? I don't know, but it's all have to compare. At the very least, I'd say I would definitely get the 3'' version of this latex topper over the 2'' to see if it works better. But, I'm skeptical since the latex is springier & harder than the memory foam so that I can't see that another inch of this is going to improve things significantly (Anyway, it's an empirical question that can be answered....)Yes, it's true that you sink into memory foam. So, if you don't like that, then this latex topper better than foam. However, apparently you have to sacrifice softness to avoid that.Yes, the memory foam is a bit hotter than the latex. However, I didn't buy the best memory foam topper in the first place. So, maybe spending more will get you a memory foam that is just as good heat-wise as this latex? In the future, I'd take my chance with memory foam hoping that more cash brings it closer to latex. I do like the holes in this latex topper. (Is that all it takes to make this topper cooler???)What to do now? I'm going to try to fit another down alternative topper to put on top of this topper. I'm curious about down alternative toppers in this first place (you can't really know until you try for a several months) and hoping that down alternative + this 2'' latex will be a success. Well, I guess it sounds like failure, doesn't, haha?Smell. I think there was an odor right out the box. But, it dissipated. Totally fine now. I obviously don't have the smell issue that other reviewers are mentioning. (Inconsistent quality control? I don't know.)Also, gotta mention price. Now (2021 Jul) this topper is 1.28x more expensive than it was in 2020. It probably didn't get than much better in a year. (And, most folks' salaries probably didn't increase by much in a year either.) Just looking worse for the review....Ok, so final verdict. This latex topper does make my old guest bedroom mattress better. But, it's not good enough. For pressure point relief, buy the 3'' and not the 2''. But, better yet, probably just don't buy this. Do some research for a good memory foam. If you don't need pressure point relief, then this latex topper is probably fine. It's springy, feels nice.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It is super comfortable. I bought the company's cover too to encase it hoping to provide some protection since the latex can easily break apart chunks here or there and also the smell after 3 months is somewhat noticeable.But man I gotta go with 2 stars here because after 1 accident from a kiddo in bed the whole thing is ruined. I'm royally pissed. You can lightly spot clean but that is kind of disgusting. If you buy this MAKE SURE TO FIND A TOPPER PROTECTOR TO ABSORB EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LIQUID OR ALL IS LOST LIKE ME. I have a mattress protector already but the topper needs it's own. You don't want latex with spills or accidents from a kid or dog on them. The cover provides minimal protection and obviously doesn't absorb. The problem is finding a mattress protector for your topper itself. Wish the company made one.Lovely product but functionality wise if you're making a big investment like this you need a protector. I can't stomach shelling out another $250 for the topper and the cover then needing to find a mattress protector that'll fit the topper too. This sucks.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

This latex topper looks and feels amazing, but I am surprised hardly anyone has mentioned the smell. It has a potent rubber smell, like a tire. I got the 2-inch and have aired it out for over a week, and I can still smell it. It's not too strong in the air now, but up close the smell is very noticeable. Touching it directly is the worst because the smell transfers to my hands and stays until I wash them. It doesn't seem to transfer to fabrics though. For example, the first day I laid on it directly to test it out, and the smell transferred to all exposed body parts but didn't stick to my clothing. I don't want to deal with a return, so I'll be keeping it regardless but am hopeful over time the smell becomes a non-issue. I will definitely update if the smell persists.Edit (4-18-18):It's been a few weeks now, and I can still smell the latex. I covered it and the mattress together in a bamboo zip-up mattress protector. On top of that is a plush bamboo topper. Then I've got my sheets on it. The smell is still there, but it's not overpowering. I can live with it. As far as comfort goes, it seems to be getting slightly softer as it is broken in, which is great. My first couple nights were miserable, but now I sleep great. No major regrets so far.Edit (7-11-18):I finally decided to bump my review down to 2 stars. Several months have gone by, and it's still very firm. It softened slightly but not nearly enough. I regret spending so much money.Edit (11-22-19):The smell is finally gone. Nothing else about it has changed though.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

However, the 2"" soft just isn't as supportive as it claims to be. I already have a hard mattress that causes me to wake up with a sore back. I got the soft based on the reviews and the recommendations on the Sleep On Latex website, but it's actually made matters worse. This topper causes me to wake up with sore spots all along my spine. The soft is not supportive and is no where near as firm as many reviewers claim. I find the softness to be comparable to a pillow-top mattress, with your body just sinking into it without much push back to support the spinal column.I'd like to return it and maybe get a medium but because I would have to pay for shipping costs, it probably isn't even worth it to send it back. What a waste!Update: Originally, this topper was not comfortable at all. I used it for about two weeks and during that experienced a great deal of back pain. I took it off my mattress with an intention of returning it, but since it was such a hassle to box up, it ended up sitting on the floor of bedroom in the clear plastic bag that it was shipped in for about three weeks. The deadline to return the topper passed and so I decided to try it again. I set the topper up as I had done before, right on top of my mattress and then with an inexpensive cotton mattress pad on top of that. This time, I experienced no back pain and actually found the topper comfortable. It no longer felt as ""squishy"" as it did before. Perhaps exposure to the air helped to stiffen it a bit? I'm not sure how, but it definitely changed for the better.Update 3/24/2016: It's been nearly six months since I've had this topper. I haven't been having great sleep but it's been decent until recently when I started to experience the same back pain that I had experienced initially. The back pain is so severe that it wakes me from my sleep. Worst sleep ever, for several days. This topper wasn't very supportive to begin with, so I don't know whether it's started to lose the little it had over time.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This topper was recommended on a reputable independent review site and odor wasn't mentioned.  But this topper's strong odor was a deal breaker.  Several reviews mentioned that, so I expected it, but hoped that with airing it out it would be ok.  I opened the package, unrolled the topper and left it in the room for a while, and when I came back the whole room was filled with an unpleasant smell.  It was a lot stronger than I expected, and the information sheet in the package stated only that the odor will ""dissipate to some extent over time"".  The wording of that doesn't inspire confidence that it would ever be dissipated enough to be bearable.  Maybe some people won't be bothered by it, but if you are sensitive to smells, and plan to put it in a small room without a lot of ventilation, don't buy this topper.  Too bad that the product description on Amazon doesn't warn the buyer up front.  It was hard to roll back up and get it into the box!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I bought this 3-inch mattress topper because they sold me on the natural latex and switched to this type. I needed the 3 inches because I have two blown discs in my lower back. However, in only 2 weeks, I'm seeing a significant sagging in the middle of the mattress already, almost 3/4 inch, a noticeable dip in the mattress. This is practically the same dip I noticed with the Talalay mattress after 3 years.  I only weigh 180 pounds at 5'9"". The underside mattress is practically new and flat, almost in new condition.  I do not have any confidence that this will be anywhere durable as the Talalay mattresses I used before. The claims that this is more durable - ""Our latex foam scored a 99/100 on the LGA physical properties test for exhibiting extraordinary performance and durability. ""... seems to be completely out of hand and perhaps a hamfisted claim. I am still waiting for a response from the company. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I don't like spending $202.57 for a mattress topper that lasts a month! I also noticed that there is no mention of the warranty- any time period-",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

When I opened it up out of the box and lay it on my bed it easily tore on the sides as I very gently was trying to center it over the mattress.  I have had other toppers that cost less than $100 that never ever did this in ten years.  That said I tried it for several weeks before deciding to return it.  I opted for the soft version as the company recommended it for side sleepers.  I found that the foam provided no support and almost completed flattened out with the weight of my body on it.  I think had I been a back sleeper it may have been okay despite the fragile quality that causes it to tear so easily when even slightly moved on the bed.I just feel that $200.00 for this was way over priced.  I realize that you pay more for latex but my last topper was less than $100 and was regular memory foam and provided much more comfort and durability than this.  I'd pass on this especially if you are a side sleeper seeking relief for your shoulder.  You won't find it with this one.  Also if you buy it better have four people moving it on the bed or it will tear assuredly.,1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It is cooler than memory foam, slightly. We got a soft 2 inch and it's supportive enough without causing pressure points(the memory foam mattress underneath is extremely firm so we need a little bit of cushion.)But the smell is awful. I didn't notice it at first, it seemed to grow over time. I've tried to air it out a few times since putting it on the mattress and it helps a little but it seems to come and go. It smells like cigarette smoke and rubber together so I don't know if this is normal or if people smoke around the manufacturing plant. Or it was used.But my biggest problem now is that there are already indentations in it where we sleep. Not huge but seems like a decent dip for having this for only 3 months. I don't remember my memory foam toppers getting worn down this quick. We are not large people; 160 lbs (give or take 10 lbs) for both of us. I hope these indentations do not get any deeper, if so this will quickly become garbage. It still seems comfortable at the moment but when the husband starts complaining about his hips bothering him we know it's caput.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

At first, the pain seemed to improve, but after a few weeks, it came back. Now, after 2 months I’m disappointed that the mattress has a noticeable sag in the middle (I’m not a heavy person.)  I sleep on side, back and stomach get back pain when on my stomach with the topper (it is noted that the soft model is not good for stomach sleepers, so I don’t fault the product for this.) For the price tag, I expected more use before it would sag, especially since my mattress has very little sag after many years. I have reversed it, but expect it will just sag in a new place before long.  Would recommend a full mattress as a better investment than a topper.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

One of them looked exactly like the photo, the second one had a shiny rubber like texture on it. Not sure why they were so different when we purchased two of the same product? The one with the shiny surface also looks to have some sort of grease spots on it, on one part of the mattress.We decided we could live with the grease spots (the one with the shiny surface) - things happen in manufacturing, after all -  so we flipped it over and put it on my bed. It sleeps incredibly hot!  I am normally the ""cold"" person in the house (always wearing a sweatshirt, etc.) and usually have extra blankets on the bed. With this topper, I am down to sleeping only with a sheet, and so I then run into doing the hot/cold tossing and turning all night. I get too cold with just the sheet, but the minute I put even one LIGHT blanket on, I start to sweat and wake up throwing the covers off. So very frustrating!If you are looking for a mattress pad to soften your bed, this will definitely work, but be forewarned that it can make you uncomfortably hot while you sleep. :(",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I bought it as a topper for our guest bedroom as the mattress is a bit on the firm side.  Laying on it feels good, but the smell of (burnt) foam rubber was absolutely terrible when we first opened it up.  I have been airing it out in the bedroom with a ceiling fan on for about 3 weeks now hoping that the smell would disappear.  It has not.  The smell is less but still very noticeable.  You can smell it just walking past the doorway to the room.  I don't believe I would be able to sleep on it for more that a few minutes.  I have purchased a natural latex 2"" topper and also a 12"" thick natural latex King size mattress from another company and they were both odor free.  Something in the manufacturing process of this topper is allowing the overpowering smell to remain in the product.  Maybe a specific final washing/rinsing method?  Anyway - some people may be able to tolerate the smell but I cannot.  I am going to return it.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's been almost two weeks now and it still stinks up any room it's in to the point it smells like you walked into a latex glove factory. It smells like the factory where all things latex are produced. If you have asthma don't get this product. You'll have to find something more expensive that has no odor at all. The smell is so strong that it doesn't matter if it's technically toxic or not. It still hinders my breathing. It's like a thick fog of latex smell that feels heavy and hard to breathe in. I've let it air out in various open air positions with the ceiling fan on. Even hung it over the edge of an indoor balcony for a week. It's not losing it's strong odor. Other then that it felt fine to sleep on at first. Until you wake up and your back is so stiff you can't walk right in the morning. For me personally this is unusable. I'm a side and stomach sleeper with back issues and find it was better for me to sleep on my uncovered firm mattress than to use this latex topper.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Topper arrived well packaged and on time.  Was heavy but managed to get it on bed myself and unwrap it.  Strong odor but let it air out a few days before putting it in the cover.  Topper was several inches too wide and too long for our queen mattress so had to cut it in order for it to fit inside the cover, (made by same company).  With the cover and sheets on, it masked the remaining odor well enuf.  After abt a week odor was no longer noticeable but this thing is NOT soft at all.  It also has formed deep dips where my husband has been laying on it.  Even with turning every time sheets are changed. (It can't be flipped without removing the cover since it has a grippy type underside.)  Topper is not rebounding as hoped and husband now wants it gone.

It is very comfortable but I spend the entire night trying to sleep in a puddle of sweat. I toss and turn and wake up a dozen times per night, sheets soaked and cold. (After reading manufacturer responses to other reviewers claiming that this topper is super-hot, I've no doubt that they will respond ""there are many factors that can make a bed hot"" so they can deny it's their product causing it. So I'll say right here that I NEVER had a problem roasting like a chicken in my bed UNTIL I PUT THIS SLEEP ON LATEX TOPPER ON MY MATTRESS.) I'm really sorry that I missed the return window because I don't want it anymore and it was expensive! It also seems quite fragile. I tore some of the holes just positioning it on my bed. Also made my mattress so thick that none of my sheets fit anymore, and they're all the super-deep-pocket type. Would not buy again, at least not at this price. Very unhappy that I'll have to toss this in the trash after spending so much money on it.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I have slept on it twice and both nights my skin started itching and burning shortly after lying on it. I am using a slipcover on the mattress pad but some of the latex must have transferred to the top of the pad when I put it on. I can't wear latex gloves due to itching so I figured out right away that this was a latex allergy problem. I saw nothing in the product description about avoiding this latex mattress pad if you have any history of latex allergies.  I bought it because I had read articles that the process for making latex mattresses is different that latex medical equipment and is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.I am going buy another Red Nomad - King Size 2 Inch Thick, Ultra Premium Gel Infused Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad Bed Topper which I have on another bed.

Then you have 2"" of uncompressed foam surrounding your body. Because of this, airflow is limited and these areas become hot and sweaty, even in winter. Keep in mind, I was only using a sheet directly on top of this foam topper. I imagine adding a cotton/polyester cover would help with the breath-ability and heat reduction. I would recommend the soft version of this topper in the 1"" version, but only as a plush pillow topper to a mattress that doesn't already have one built in, the 2"" thickness is just too much and feels suffocating. I will probably try the firm or medium firm version of this topper next. As far as the material goes, this brand seems worth the money, there is a slight odor, but it's a natural one and dissipates quickly. Be careful moving this topper because it feels like it could tear without much effort.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I have tried the memory foam ones and they are comfy but I don’t like that “sucked in” feeling. This latex one has pros and cons which I will list below. I personally don’t believe it is worth the cost but I don’t want to deal with the headache of returning it.Pros: Alleviates pressure point pain. Doesn’t retain body heat as much as memory foam. Doesn’t “suck” you in like memory foam.Cons: Latex smell is still strong after 1 week which can cause irritation and make sleeping difficult.  Not as soft as memory foam. I have only used it one week and it already has an “body impression” like spot that you roll onto (I am not a heavy person).Conclusion: In some ways this is better than the memory foam mattress toppers but I don’t believe it is worth the extra money.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

In the sealed (duct tape under the door & taped close A/C duct) cabana bath with the open window, the towels, rug, & curtain absorbed the strong odor also. Has off-gassed considerably by now, but still cannot tolerate in same room even when covered all around with a mattress pad, which takes on the odor. I have had a latex mattress & 3 other latex mattress toppers for years, with never this experience. I hope it is an anomaly with this specific mattress topper. Otherwise, lovely soft, springy & supportive, unlike ridiculous ""memory"" gel foam.

I always wondered what it means for a bed to be too soft. Well, with this, I can tell you in detail. It is so soft that if I sleep with a pillow, it drives my hips into the bed and leaves my Back sore. Really most of my back is sore because it has been unnaturally stretched all night long. I’m glad there is a sustainable option instead of plastic. But now I feel terrible that I wasted resources purchasing this. And I’m going to have to waste more replacing it. Worst sleep I’ve ever had. There is an odor, I’ve heard it describe “like sugar cane”. After sleeping in this all night, you WILL smell like “sugar cane” in the morning. I’m completely exhausted from several days of lack of sleep. Considering sleeping on the floor. Just desperate for the replacement to arrive as quickly as possible.

Customer service is great. So why only 2 stars? Because these things just don't work. If your mattress is too hard, your hips and shoulders will sink through the topper and mash against the mattress. All it does is add mushiness and heat to the bed so most of your body feels weird and mushy and the parts where you need pressure relief don't get any help. I hate to say it but the only way to fix a bad mattress is to buy a better one. Also if you think you're going to get free return, you might be disappointed to discover that once the foam is out of the box it won't fit back in it. They will send you a bigger box but they won't come to your address to pick it up. If you can't fit it in your car to drive it to a faraway pickup location, it will cost $24 to have it picked up.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

Everyone is right, it does not smell too bad, though there is some latex odor, which is not strong. The size is very generous, and it's nearly 50 lbs so it's heavy. BUT I have to score this item low because of the misleading description which boasts that it is 3"" firm. There is NOTHING firm about it. I have scoliosis, and cannot sleep on soft mattresses. We got this to help firm out memory foam mattress (which is only 2 years old) - I didn't sleep well for the first two nights, thinking I should give it a chance. By night number 3 I slept on the couch, and the next day we prepared it to ship back. My husband didn't mind it much, but he also doesn't need the support quite like I do.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

We have a nice full latex mattress from Costco which is a bit firm but ultimately I think it will work for us.

I have Fibromyalgia with chronic pain and tenderness which leads to soreness from even small pressure points or fabric bunching up.I also am very sensitive to smells, so I was a little worried some reviews said smell was strong.I'm super happy, I planned to open it and potentially leave in another room to expand and air out. To my surprise, when I unwrapped it from the plastic it quickly rolled out and was immediately to size!Completely shocked. It was really cool. If you have kids let them watch it pop to life.They do sell a nice cover for it however I have it under a mattress protector so I don't see a need.The smell was strong, however it didn't give me issues leave on the bed and sleeping on it the first night. Within a few nights I no longer noticed smell at all. Yay!Yes I still have constant pain, but it is not amplified by mattress anymore. Compared to memory foam that is under it it breathes a little better. Hot flashes are less intense and bed isn't soaked as before. I wouldn't say it's cooling though.Material has amazing bounce back similar to unrolling. While it was still on the floor I walked on it and jumped on it and it provided cushion, a little spring, and followed foot up as it was lifted. Memory foam doesn't return quickly and is NOT soft to quickly fall into.I like that this is a USA company and it is using natural material. Even not having cover saves when it is not needed.If you need a soft-med mattress because you have sore hips, knees, back, definitely consider this. Due to the amount of spring back and from what I've read about latex I'm looking forward to this lasting much longer then my cheap foam topper that was replaced on top of memory foam.What is great about getting twin sizes is you can have different toppers on each side of the bed depending on each person's needs.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We innocently decided to shop for a new king-size mattress after going on vacation and sleeping great, then returning home and realizing it was time for our old mattress to be put out to pasture. We bought a medium-priced Beautyrest firm pillowtop from Macy's, and spent a miserable month tossing and turning until Macy's agreed to send a technician out to inspect.  He determined we had 1-1/2"" body impressions on each side, and we're average sized folks. Crazy! After some haggling, we were able to return the mattress and box springs for a full refund and our quest continued. After MUCH reading on the internet, I discovered that mattresses are no longer made as in days of old - they cannot be flipped, and body impressions are very common within the first year because the memory foam that most are made from, does not spring back. We spent a day at Bedrooms and More in Seattle, a company that makes their own mattresses ""the old way"". The one we bought is a firm innerspring, tight-top (not pillowtop). It's a great place to shop, with reasonable prices. They even have a free mattress class that you can take before you buy, and encouraged us to turn the mattress 90 degrees once per month for 2 months, then flip over and start again. This will help avoid the lumps, bumps and dips over time.  However, the mattress is still a bit too firm for our liking, so I took the plunge and ordered the 2"" soft, king-size Pure Green latex topper from Amazon.  What a dream!!  From the very first night, we both slept great, and the topper molded to hips, shoulders and elbows nicely, as we're both side-sleepers. It has really helped my arthritis pain. It is springy (but not annoyingly so), is not hot at all (like memory foam), and keeps its shape.  It's so comfortable that I don't want to get up in the morning!  I had a few questions, so I contacted the Sleep On Latex company thru the Amazon website, and had an answer from the owner within 24 hours!  Amazing. The moral of this story is - buy a firm innerspring mattress, and add a latex topper. Or, revitalize a tired mattress with a latex topper and you can buy yourself some time. The next thing on my wish list is a wool mattress pad...and a new topper for the RV - then we're all set!  Thanks for reading this long post. I had no idea that mattress shopping would be so complicated and hope this information will help someone else.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I borrowed the 2"" after she raved so much about it. We both suffer from a connective tissue disorder that makes sleep uncomfortable. We wake constantly with subluxations (body parts that slip out of place), having to shift, roll over, etc., at least 20 times a night which can get old really fast. I borrowed the 2"" topper from her spare room and had the best sleep of my life for two nights! I usually wake up at a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale in the morning until I can take my meds, but with this topper, I wake up at a 2 or a 3 out of 10 on the pain scale, which is huge!!!! I immediately ordered my own.I went bigger, however, and purchased the 3"" soft topper instead of the 2"" soft topper that I'd borrowed from my sister. I thought that bigger would be better! Unfortunately, I was wrong. When the 3"" soft topper arrived, I realized that it was a *touch* too deep for me. It had the same soft/wonderful/cool support that feels like sleeping on a cloud, but it put me into a position that was awful.  I have to sleep on my side with a king pillow wedged in behind me for support, as well as a king pillow in front for support. I use a gel pillow under my head and the 3"" topper was *just* deep enough that it tilted my head just a fraction beyond what is comfortable for my body and I was in agony :( I was so sad! I wanted it to work so badly but I couldn't bear it after a few nights as it was just a tiny bit too tall. (My spouse said the 3"" was the same as the 2"" just to give you some reference. I was the only one that noticed the change!) This is where the review gets awesome.I emailed the company, and literally within minutes, they responded. I had a return started with Amazon, they were shipping me a box big enough to return it (because my overzealous spouse had already recycled the BIG box that the 3"" topper came in), and I purchased the 2"" soft topper. In just a few days, I received the box, packed up the 3"" topper to return, and had the new 2"" topper on my bed. Sleep on Latex ordered a UPS pick up at my home at no cost to me, and I happily pushed the big box onto the front porch and went upstairs to flop down on my bed in relief.There were about eight emails back and forth to coordinate the logistics, and this was HANDS DOWN the best customer service I have ever received. Like, EVER! And that, to me as a consumer, is invaluable. They listened, responded, and problem-solved like pros.Oh, and I almost forgot....I didn't order the zippered cover when I bought the first 3"" topper. I realized that I wanted it when I read other reviews about how much easier it made moving it around on the bed (it's super hard for me to bend over, and anything that makes my life easier to shift the thing around on my mattress is great. The topper is kind of...well....latex-ish when you don't have a cover on it so it's maybe 20% harder to move around on a big bed by myself. Don't get me wrong, it's not difficult, just...active. Putting sheets on the bed flows better when the cover is on, too! But you def don't NEED the cover if you don't want it. A mattress protector or other top sheet would be just fine if you don't want to spend the money, but the cover really does improve my experience with the topper. I don't share other reviews' frustration with the zip-off top, I thought it was very clever! That way, I can just zip off the top, wash it, and zip it back on without flopping the topper around by myself. Very smart!) Anyway, I ordered the cover, and my new 2"" topper ARRIVED ALREADY INSIDE THE COVER. How great is that?!? Seriously. I appreciated that extra step SO MUCH and almost cried when I opened the box to see that. To me, that goes above and beyond what any company is required to do. That extra step meant so much.So, long review short, this 2"" soft topper is a game-changer. I love it. It's worth every penny and I want to purchase them for every bed in my home.  It takes my already-bowed five-year-old memory foam mattress from sucky to amazing. The zip-off topper cover makes my life easier. The topper makes my nights better. It's just bouncy enough, my spouse doesn't feel my move around, it's nice and cool, and feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud. It keeps my pressure points supported, my bones don't slip out of place, I wake up rested and almost pain-free, and it's easy to maintain. (Oh, and because nobody else has mentioned it, it doesn't take away from romantic time, either :) )Buy this product. And buy it from this company. I'm so grateful!!! Thank you SleeponLatex!!!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After getting sticker shock and being overwhelmed by all the mattress options I found a website that compares mattresses, mattress toppers and pillows. The site stated that for heavier people, side sleepers and couples this was one of the best options.  We decided after reading some of the other very helpful reviews on here to go with the queen 3"" soft topper. It came in a smallish VERY heavy box (so if you have trouble lifting items make sure you will have help when this is delivered to you!)  We opened and unrolled the topper. We didn't leave it to air out because it was nearly bedtime, and I felt like the smell wasn't too awful. We have just regular depth fitted sheets and I was sure they wouldn't fit after seeing just how thick the mattress topper really was- however the sheets fit well. After sleeping on and changing the sheets sets several times now I am impressed that I din't have to go out and buy special fitted sheets to accommodate the topper! No problems at all with a normal fitted sheet covering both the mattress and topper, and absolutely no problems with the fitted sheet staying on all night over the topper.  5 stars for not making my life difficult!  As far as the smell, while it did smell some when opening- the smell has faded and is no longer an issue at all. 5 stars for not making me gag!  The comfort of the topper is very impressive. I was kind of anticipating comfort at first when laying down, but then throughout the night it not being as comfortable simply from being compressed by 2 bodies for hours. This is not at all the case! The topper remains comfortable all night long, not too springy and not too squishy. I was concerned that buying the soft topper would be too marshmallow-y, but I've got to say- I am so thankful we went with soft and not the medium! I thought being too soft would not give enough support and cause our backs to hurt, but it has done very well supporting and not overly cloudlike! 5 stars for comfort and support!  Now, the negative.... we bought and started using this topper in January, during a particularly frigid winter, often below zero. Our bedroom is very cold, and I have trouble staying warm no matter how many blankets we have! After adding the topper to our bed, I find myself kicking off some covers and waking because I am too warm. This worries me since it's winter and I'm too warm, what will it be like in the summer when our underinsulated room is hot? I am thinking the amount of body heat the synthetic topper holds may make sleeping in warmer conditions really unpleasant. So 4 stars (for now) for holding in heat and disrupting sleep. I will update in the summer, hopefully I won't have to knock off more stars!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I contacted their customer service and they kindly suggested I return this medium one via Amazon, and order the soft one. They offered to send me a box to package the return. I just got the soft one and it really is wonderful. My body feels gently cradled, and I can side sleep now with comfort. Unlike previous toppers that smelled of terrible chemicals and that needed aerating for weeks prior to use, these came with a slight rubber smell, not unpleasant. I aerated them for a couple of days under a fan anyway, and the smell was no longer noticeable once in the cover. I’m very happy with this purchase and their customer service: years of good sleep ahead!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

If you didn't know all 4 major brands are from the same factory, memory foam and other inferior forms of foam are hot and leave you sleeping in a hole on one of these mattresses after as little as a month. I am 125 lbs and 5'7, partner is 5'11,150 lbs, we already had indentations in our mattress after 1 month. I read up on the whole pillow top mattress scam and how memory foam is really crap, how people went though multiple Beautyrest  blacks, and Tempurpedics only to find out each one failed in the same way. Extreme sagging. Well, I did my research and now I have this on top of my one month old Beautyrest and it is a godsend. You will never sleep on what feels like hot sand again, like on memory foam, the latex is so soft and it's not toxic like memory foam.(I got the  2' soft).This is dunlop not talalay and I assure you talalay is NOT softer than dunlop, This topper is Firmness rating 20 ILD (soft). I find it plush, perfect for a top layer. I would use a firmer rating for the second and third layers as they do when they make pure latex mattress. What I am trying to say is if Zen Heaven or whomever is trying to tell you talalay is so much better than dunlop they are lying, they are just trying to charge you more money. This product is perfect, I just wish I had known about it before I bought an expensive innerspring. If your innerspring is really in bad shape you can even flip it over and throw one of these toppers on it, I hear it works like a charm. Stay away from memory foam, it really is crap. So hopefully I have saved my 1 month old Beautyrest silver from what others have gone though, and added a few years to it, because the way it was going it was bound for the dumpster in 6 months max. it's very comfortable now with this plush latex layer that is not hot on top of the Beautyrest crap pillow top that slept so hot I woke up sweating multiple Xs a night, plus is as softer than my Beautyrest rated a 7 for super softness and NO SAGGING. I recommend a firmer 3 inch if you have a more serious sagging problem than I did, but if you buy this you will not be sorry and it will outlast your mattress. I will report back in 3 months and let you know how it's holding up.Edit: I flipped over the Beautyrest innerspring because it already had such sagging on the pillowtop I wanted to rip off after just a month of buying it, it was too much. It continued to sag under the topper, so I took the plunge, flipped it, and now there is zero sagging and a 2” plush latex on top under my sheet, with the protector on the mattress because the latex sleeps so cool, I love it! I sleep like the dead and have no pain or ever wake up sweating, same with my husband who use to sweat puddles on memory foam. I saved a ton of money and my sheets still fit, I have always bought king for my queen.  So, don’t hesitate on a sagging pillowtop innersping and wake in pain. Flip it and add a few inches of latex, support AND plush comfort or firm support W/E, choose the one or layers that fit your needs. When this gives out this company has my lifelong business, I hear they make a great mattress and if I had more cash I would have bought one already, but this is working so perfectly so I have zero reason to spend more money. Couldn’t be happier.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Bear with me on my review, I wanted to try to give the best all around opinion.I'm one of those people that have spent thousands of dollars on mattresses and toppers, trying to find some combination that works for comfort and pain relief. I have back issues and joint pain, to generalize my medical history. Not to mention, I'm getting old, which sucks. Suffice it to say, pain is constant with me.Then I tried this latex topper! Wow!I've tried all the different kinds of memory foam toppers out there and pretty much hated every single one. I don't like the 'sink in'  or 'sleeping in a cloud' thing. Yes, it seems somewhat comfortable. For about an hour.Then it's hard to move and makes my back hurt worse because of no support. Also, memory foam is hot too, and I hate to sweat while I'm sleeping. Uggh, gross!I've tried many of them. From cheap to expensive. Even every kind of thickness, none of them seemed to work, spending a small fortune.  I hate them. I ended up giving them away or tossed them in the trash. Such a waste of money.Now, this latex topper is a total game changer!  It's not anything like a memory foam, which after my rant, is a huge plus!It's comfort, softness AND support. I'm a skeptical person, could even call me cynical.  But the fact remained, I needed something to add to my mattress to relieve the pressure points. I'm a side sleeper mostly, occasionally sleeping on my back.This latex topper helped out sooo much! No more shoulder or hip pain, even easing some of my back pain. Wow!! Im amazed at it, really. All from 2 inches of latex.Mattresses are so different, as are people. So many different types and in every price range. Mattresses, not people.Higher prices don't make them better though. Neither do trends.So, I aimed for the decent inexpensive mattresses instead, settling on a lightweight innerspring poly foam one. It's actually more comfortable than the one I spent 2200 bucks on a few years ago. I tried an 10 inch all memory foam one too, and hated it. Gave that away.Now, my mattress shouldn't be that comfortable, right? It's not expensive or anything fancy to brag about, but it is the best mattress I've slept on. I can't sleep on firm beds, causes way too much pain. I need something soft but supporting my spine.But, if it's comfortable, why get a topper? Because I still needed something soft to help out with the lingering hip and shoulder pain. To add that extra layer of  softness and luxury that a good mattress should beg for. Beckoning to be crawled into at night.This 2 inch soft latex topper did that. It worked great at relieving the pain but supporting me thru the night. Allowing me to move around freely and wake up in way less pain. Together, it makes my bed super comfy now!! I look forward to going to sleep, knowing I'm going to wake up in less pain.My mattress is fine now, it's not sagging or in bad shape. Nor is it super thick. Only 10 inches, without the topper. I have no need to hack away at it, or flip it over or hope the topper 'fills in the gaps' from holes left by bodies constantly sleeping in the same spot. If my mattress was in totally bad shape, I'd just replace it. The topper is great but it's not that magical to fix a worn out saggy bad mattress.Honestly, I've already spent enough money on previous mattresses, just trying to find a comfortable one.  But the cost of the one I have now, was very affordable. At that logic, I could replace it regularly and still spend less than one I bought 8 years ago.They say it's recommended to get a new mattress every 7 years.7 years is the magic number for a lot of things, actually. Matresses, cars, houses, jobs, even spouses.I would recommend this topper to anyone and everyone!!The latex is not squishy-soft, in-a-cloud-like-marshmellows soft,  but more subtle, cushiony, supportive, almost bouncy softness.It does not sag, losing it's shape after laying on it for hours, but provides the support to keep you aligned. It does not need to 'bounce back' like memory foam because it does not squish down or form indents from your body shape that has to 'fluff' back up after hours, if it ever does.It did not have a smell to it, nor did I find the need to expose it to the elements either. Sunlight is great, but it can affect things differently. I found no instructions to put it outside, or to air it out. I simply unpacked it, put it on my mattress and let it be. Even with the door closed to my room, after several hours, there was no smell. Definitely no offensive smells like all the memory foam I've had in the past.It's just an all around totally awesome topper.You can bet the house, that if this one ever needs to be replaced, I won't hesitate to purchase another one. The company that makes them is great. Super helpful if you have questions. Delivery was quick.All in all, I'm happy with everything and hope this helps others who want to try this latex topper.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I observed Latex Production in my teens,it should be like a car tire rubber with less  Durometer of hardness because Tires are made to endure roads/streets,etc.,not sleep on.Latex should be resilient,firm,rubber like,yet tender,(Not pasta to the tooth al dente)giving to a point,(Yet nothing of the sinking of memory foam I dislike),firm more than expensive leather couch padding,(Ok for a brief period,yet not too decent for sleeping on a lot.) Latex is the opposite of the cheap,airy,not even Polyurethane or latex foam they sent,I am insulted for myself and the unwary,as the reviews I read should have warned me,they almost did,especially the complaints of how it's like a no support foam,which is exactly what it is.I worked making furniture a year or 2 in my teens and at 20,this ""latex"" is super cheap foam,a joke,considered as only one or two of the many layers (They would be firmer for the middle inner of a mattress,than this rip off foam,though.)in making beds,needed near the top layer under the covering and stitching,I would choose a dry very stiff thin foam layer,direct under the outer cover,then this foam,it cannot really be noticed,it flattens immediately like nothing there,though helps protect the covering,it must be protected from underneath,a matress made like this can last for many years without flattening too much,I learned this from one of the best Mattress Makers,thats how she learned,after High School.This ""latex"" is about what I just mentioned,the most cheapest, unsupporting foam ever,not even worth maybe $2.00,about what I paid for it then while making matresses,at 1"" thick,twin size.(I thought it reminded me of something,even my first job stocking in a corner store for ""Umpteen"" $ a week,whats that mean,I asked.$13.00,I was told,the first teen after $12.00,your'e only 10 years old,just a child.(Ha-ha,I'm amused nowadays,I did not think it was funny then.Hard to forget.Not exactly big $,boy,did I work hard all my life.)Latex is the best I have had,(Except for air matresses,if they wouldn't flatten,a bunch cheap and expensive went in the trash,not really worth the $.)first Dunlop,which can smell,the plastic helps,then Talalay,which smells less,(Talalay is better,as the refining process is better and more cost to make than Dunlop,do not let anybody lie to you.)the reverse of any latex is bad,if the under matress is not of enough firmness,the latex on top is not supported enough.Expect splits in about a year anyway on either choice,D or T,placed on a hard board,or however,glues do not work too decent,tapes are better.Personally,I wrap my matresses,pillows and toppers in 6ml plastic,use enough to place mattress flat,bring over and beyond top,about a foot beyond,cut to match,or one an inch or so short,black Gorilla tape Tough and Wide(Better than other colors,worth the $15.00 or so.),tape so seam is in middle or so,fold and press,bring up on mattress,press and try to eliminate space,tape again,seam to matress,I use many small peices to shorten up any billowing,a small hole,(You usually do not need to,when you try it out,it'll pop,you may need a small peice of tape if too big,leave a tiny opening.)Do this first before wrapping a comforter around mattress and topper,(Topper is,of course,already on mattress top.),and hold comforter with under straps,though straps can and do break.The comforter stops much of the hot/cold/stick/noise problem,as it is thick enough to,hell,the comforter themselves doubled,2 can provide 4 plush layers,making your own topper,adjustable,the bargain ones at Departyment Stores are worth it here,way better than useless foam.(The ""useless"" foam is needed in bed making though,as the 2nd layer under the stiff styrofoam like layer just under the stitched covering must have this foam next,or the matress swiftly chaps,the next 10 or so layers are of varying foams,etc.,adjusted to the vare of firmness,etc.)A fitted sheet can work to hold comforter smoothly.Attach the straps to that,as the thickness of comforters tends to break the holders on straps.The comforter can be used a long time before washing,the 6ml plastic virtually water/dust proofs it,a spills a pain,at least the plastic can be damp wiped.I do not eat or drink on my matresses anymore,rare.I keep one comforter ready/stored for that reason,air tighted is best,or chew throughs can occur,they do not know what food is anyway.The pillow(s) need a zip case or 2,works better than 2 pillow cases,with 2nd one reversed,sticking to plastic is to be avoided.This ""Latex""rip off (I thought the name was funny.) is not even latex foam they sent for 137.79 twin size,with 4 year warranty,they claim it is natural latex,(No way!Real Latex is like actual flexible rubber.),and upon unwrapping,I felt and knew immediately what it is,a rip off.A lot of people do not know latex,having never seen it made,it is liquid rubber from a rubber tree,processed shaped,mixed sometimes,like Talalay, and cured in a form,so if that expensive latex topper or mattress cost x amount of $ to make,make sure to get the warranty,worth every penny,as they still make a profit from the cost of the warranty alone,it covers the obtaining and production,all ""Overhead.""Though everything must break, eventually,it cost minimal,or not at all,if so many acres of rubber trees are owned,#100,00 plus matresses can be made first,before machines break,what's 10 or $20,000 to fix a roller,(How expensive,compared to making many millions for a rip off.)thats what ruins existence,owners can have millions of $$ and more in their accounts,the next person's on welfare or ssi,or slave to a clock,not exactly because they want to be.(Yeh,charge thousands for something that costs $67.00 to make,overhead and all,not available to the Public.)Manufacturers,which are usually the Farm owners or source from etc.,think we are chattle.Well,though I consider I am my own person,they got enough $ to keep me poor,flattening my meager wallet condescendingly,they have too much $$, and do not share the land and resources properly,this Earth's a shame.Well,anywho,personally,I consider the Martha Stewart firm foam core pillow slight better than even shredded latex for a pillow,which is better than the whole latex pillow for me,though know I slept on a hard floor till I was 17.How cold,with just a bed sheet under me,it made me hard,though I grew up poor.Now I am 60,and not so hard anymore.It's always one thing or the other,if the water heater does not break,($14,000 plus,they wanted,I fixed it myself for less than $400.00,which includes $350. or so for a 40 gallon Electric hot water heater,just right for one person.),I gotta go up on the roof,though I got bunches more down time now,with time running out,now I gotta rewrap/return after waiting for delivery.I do not appreciate the excruciation and wall of ignorance on almost every product.Thank you.Mike",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I started out trying to fix the problem with a 2” soft Sleep on Latex topper. I’ve had a latex pillow before, but to have it under your whole body is different, like sleeping on cake. It’s cushioning yet supportive, it rebounds quickly so there’s no sinking feeling like memory foam, it doesn’t retain heat, it’s soft enough to relieve pressure, but buoyant enough to actively support concave curves in your body.We realized after a couple of weeks that 2” wasn’t quite enough, as we could still feel the firmness of the new mattress beneath it. We are both lightweight side sleepers (5’7 115lbs & 5’9 140lbs) so it’s easy for mattresses to feel too firm for us — in hindsight I should’ve gotten a 3”, but it’s fine, it kicked off our latex journey :)Weeks of research lead me to believe that Talalay processed latex might be the next best thing to get to stack on top of the Sleep on Latex topper. Sleep on Latex doesn’t make Talalay toppers, just Dunlop, so I had to get one from another company.Note on Talalay vs Dunlop: The best comparison I’ve found is Talalay = angel food cake & Dunlop = pound cake. As the owner of both, the difference isn’t big enough to fret over, IMHO. Talalay is more expensive due to the slightly more complex process, and is a little bouncier/more responsive as a pressure relief layer as a result of having more air bubbles in it, while Dunlop is exceedingly supportive because of its density. Both outclass all other topper materials when it comes to durability, longevity, support, pressure relief, eco-friendliness, value, and utter lack of heat retention, among other things.Anyway, the combination of the 3” Talalay + 2” Dunlop made our bed feel like a big marshmallow. It was amazing. However, I was waking up really sore in my hips from them partially dislocating in my sleep (I have the connective tissue disorder EDS), and ultimately found that the soft & fancy mattress at the bottom was failing to provide sufficient support.I went looking for a less-expensive, still-nice mattress with reputable pocketed coils to use as our base/support layer. The best one we found that met our requirements was literally one fifth of the price of the other mattress (which has since been returned), and the firmness of it unexpectedly & perfectly compliments the latex’s softness, providing the support that a very soft mattress could not, but it still felt ever so slightly too firm.I reached out to Sleep on Latex again with about 100 questions. Among many very helpful insights, they suggested folding our 2” in half under the Talalay to see if that felt better. It absolutely did, so I ordered another 2” soft (practically giddy to feed my newfound addiction to latex bedding, lol).We are (finally) sleeping more comfortably than we have in literal years on top of a whopping 7” of latex on top of an inexpensive-yet-reputable firm 8” pocketed coil mattress.Note on layering: if you’re going all-in on latex like we did but still want the bounce & breathability of coils, make sure the mattress at the bottom is on the firm side (or if you can afford a no-return policy, just get straight pocketed coils for a full DIY mattress). **You can always make a firm bed softer, but you can never firm up a soft bed — plush mattresses are literally just the firm equivalent of that mattress with additional foam on top.** I’d personally much rather be able to control the type and feel of the comfort layer(s) than have it permanently stitched onto a bed that might not work for me. And because it’s modular, single layers can be replaced as needed rather than having to get rid of the whole thing, so it’s more eco-conscious and will last longer. When I figured this out, it felt like I’d cracked the code/cheated the system. Worth it.Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Sleep on Latex also sells the BEST cotton stretch topper covers on the market. It’s really worth getting one if you want your latex topper to last as long as possible. If you order directly from their website, they’re available in every increment from 1”-12”, so one could contain a whole DIY mattress inside a single cover. The top and bottom unzip so the top half can be machine washed, it’s surprisingly easy to put on, makes it way easier to move the latex around without risking a rip, the cotton twill bottom does not slip around (even with our adjustable bed base), and it doesn’t change the feel of the latex at ALL. Per the reps at SoL, it is not designed to protect the topper form liquid, so if you need something waterproof, invest in a TPU mattress protector. It will change the texture of the latex a little, which shouldn’t be bothersome unless you’re super texturally-sensitive (if you are, but still need a waterproof protector, it feels less weird to layer it underneath the cotton stretch cover).Enjoy totally changing the way you sleep for the better :)",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

So I ordered a replacement (it's $85 + tax for 2"" king) and mentioned in my order that this was to replace a cover where the zipper had come off. Within 30m, I got an email from CS, reversing the charges and sending out via 2 day fedex that same morning a replacement for free because they said that the zipper shouldn't have come off and that it's not fair to have the customer pay for something that wasn't their fault. I was really impressed they did that without me even asking. Furthermore, the replacement cover is better than the one that came pre-attached when I ordered on Amazon: the zipper, on both the top and bottom parts, is a totally normal zipper, like what's at the bottom of your jacket. The original cover I can't really describe how the zipper tracks worked, but they were confusing and were easier to accidentally have the zipper come off. Well, maybe if you're a luddite like me that struggles even with putting on a duvet cover.5 stars for comfort (2"" king size soft model). I'm a side sleeper and normally my hip gets sore when I sleep. I've used this for a few weeks now: not a single mote of pain. Same for sleeping on my back. So it gets perfect marks for sleep quality. Furthermore, I did not notice ANY latex scent like some people here seem to claim. Maybe it's because I bought it with the cover already attached? Regardless, at one point I spilled red wine on the cover so I figured I'd wash it. Big mistake. While yes, you can wash it, the zipper easily came off and I spent literally 4 hours trying to figure out how to just simply reattach it. Total waste. So now I have to separately order a replacement cotton topper ($85), wait for that to arrive, then attempt to attach it. You can't buy the cotton topper alone on Amazon: you can only separately buy it direct from the manufacturer, FYI.So tl;dr - 5 stars for everything but cleaning. The zipper is way too easy to accidentally come off and then it becomes impossible as far as I can tell to reattach it. So 1 star for that. But it's still functional, doesn't smell, fixes all my sleep discomfort issues, so I'll just deduct 1 star from the original 5 star review.FYI - If you get a really bad stain like I did, a good way to clean it safely is:1. Use either coarse kosher salt or baking soda and take a toothbrush and scrub a good amount on BOTH sides of the stain2. after that's done, dump the salt, and then pour on some more salt/soda directly on the stain and let it sit for (YMMV) at least an hour, enough time to soak up as much as it can.3. Dump the salt/soda4. Take a toothbrush, and mix a small dab of dish detergent (for hand washing, not your dishwasher), and the hottest water you got.5. Scrub until your arm is sore BOTH sides, using circular motions as well as back/forth6. Use the hottest water you got in your shower to rinse that off7. Take hydrogen peroxide - it's safe (it's actually the main ingredient in bleach-less ""bleach"" aka color safe and safe for clothing in general) and pour it all over the stain. Repeat the same Cinderella-style tasks of scrubbing til your arm hurts with another toothbrush.8. By now you should definitely be seeing an improvement. When you think it's pretty good, like not anywhere near as much left, once again rinse it all off with your hottest shower water9. Soak the stained part in white vinegar (safe for cleaning pretty much anything) if you have a particularly tough stain like I did, for a few hours.10. Rinse with hot water.11. The stain should be gone, or if not, nearly gone.12. Wash it in your machine: if you have a HE model, pour about 1/4 cup of white vinegar into the fabric softener tray (yes, fabric softener) and just for good measure another 1/4 cup directly into the bottom of the drum and then toss the cover in the machine.13. Wash on warm - I couldn't find a garment tag so I don't know what the hottest it can take is, but I chose the lowest temp above cold14. If, like me, you're super paranoid, when done do another wash cycle but this time use the ""color safe bleach"" aka plain old hydrogen peroxide: add that to the normal bleach area and, at least with the Clorox brand I got, it said to also add some directly to the HE soap container.15. Both times I washed it, I also did a prewash with a small amount of standard detergent, and both times I did extra rinses to be sure everything was washed away.16. Again, couldn't find a garment tag, but given it's pre-shrunk, I dried it at the lowest temperature (I have a super low setting, even lower than ""low"" and just above ""air dry"" on my LG) for an hour and it was all dried and cleaned.17. BE CAREFUL OF THE ZIPPER - MINE EASILY FELL OFF, probably due to negligence (I have a hard time putting duvet covers on as well as doing stuff like this).",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It was soft and we thought we ordered a firm.  My son said he liked it so we kept it.  Now we wish we had returned.  It's too soft just like I thought and a bit flimsy.  It's a topper, not a mattress, so I guess that's okay.  However, I checked back to 2015 and realized I had ordered two Latex mattress toppers.  I like these much better.  Better quality, more substantial.  These were called ""100% Natural Latex,"" and the brand is ""Ultimate Sleep.""  In my opinion, this is a much better item.  I don't recommend the Pure Green, but I do recommend the 100% Natural Latex.  I ordered a Pure Green Organic Latex Mattress and now I'm hoping it's a good one.  I do ""really"" like the Sleep on Latex Mattress Topper Cover.  The quality is amazing.  I got a 3-inch to go over a 2-inch topper.

The topper itself seems heavy and high quality, it was just too soft for my needs and caused me alignment problems and pain in my back, much like my old pillowtop mattress (I would say this is just as soft as a pillowtop IMO). I am 5' 6"" and 130 pounds and I felt like I mostly sunk in and didn't have the support I needed, though it was not a quicksand type of sinking like memory foam. I think if you enjoy a very soft feel that surrounds you, you may like this product, however I would probably get a 3""in that case because the 2"" I had sunk me down pretty far into the mattress. All of this is coming from someone who has a bed with a medium firm latex top layer, and now that I have adapted to that I think the soft was simply not supportive enough for me. I returned this product and the process was fairly easy as far as dealing with the company. They were prompt in giving me an RMA number and refunding my money. Getting the topper itself back into a box was a whole other story! They did offer to exchange the product instead but I declined because exchanges or refunds are limited to 1 per year and after all of the hassle of getting this product shipped and the uncertainty of whether I would like the firmer version I decided to just skip a topper for now. I may decide to give the medium a try in the future if my current bed starts to become uncomfortable though, because I did feel the product was well made. I thought this was a good deal with shipping included, just be aware that a king is going to cost you at least $40 to return, if not more if you don't like it. I recommend talking very in depth with the company for recommendations on which topper would best suit your needs :)",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I ordered on a Friday and it showed up that next Tuesday. It is exactly 2"".However, I called Sleep On Latex prior to ordering to explain to him what I needed out of a topper. I said I need support as well as pressure point relief as I'm a side sleeper who has scoliosis, and many subluxations of the spine and loss of curve in my neck. I'm in a ton of pain everyday and night so I NEED something that is supportive enough so I don't sink down INTO the topper. I need to sleep ON the topper. I was initially going to purchase the Medium Firm 2"" but he insisted that the 2"" Soft is what i need and said that even the Soft is still pretty firm.... Well..... I just recieved it today, put it on the bed and trust me the Soft is VERY SOFT! I can pinch the topper inbetween my index and thumb and feel my fingers touch each other. Very soft. I was really really hoping that it was going to be firmer like he said it would be. 😢 My hip area while laying on my side still dips down too much for my liking. I think, since returning it from here in Toronto would be too much of a hassle, I'm going to keep it, and wait until I can afford to get the medium firm one.Oh yeah, about the smell. It does have an odor that kind of reminds me of baby formula lol which is odd but it's NOTHING over powering like I've smelled from toxic polyurethane toppers. Hopefully the smell will dissipate in time.I'm not sure if it sleeps hot yet as I haven't slept on it. I just really wish I had of gotten the medium firm. Oh well..

This is was the best night's sleep I've had in a long time.  I have intermittent sciatica and am sensitive to pressure points and this topper was great.  It solved all the problems I had with memory foam but kept the memory foam positives.  I liked the plushness that had a springy supportiveness to it, unlike a memory foam topper, which, for me, had the plushness but would ooze out of the way and leave me with pressure points from the mattress below and also slept hotter.  I am a back and side sleeper, 180lbs.Now my wife.  1 star.  She hated this topper.  She said it was like sleeping on an air mattress.  It sprang back too much for her and seemed to be pushing her out of position.  She admitted that it didn't have the motion transfer problems of an air mattress.  But she disliked exactly what I liked about the topper.  Perhaps it is because she is lighter (120lbs), and thus the 2 inch was too much for her.  My experience was completely opposite.I am going to return the 2 inch soft and get a 1 inch soft and see if that suites both of us.  If not, I will get a 2 inch soft twin just for my side.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I had high hopes for this topper (3"", queen, ""soft""). The feel is soft to the touch, but with a consistency/bounce similar to very firm Jell-o. We let it expand for 24 hours, although it seemed to take shape quickly, and aired it out for a day in a room with windows open and fans running.While somewhat soft feeling, the pad doesn't really ""give"" in the way a foam pad does. I'd say its better for pressure points - which irritate bursitis for me - than soft foam. However, something about the latex feels much firmer than I expected in the way it holds you. I've been waking up with shoulder pain and sciatica down my legs while side sleeping. I don't feel this is any cooler than my previous 3"" memory foam pad.Of note, the smell is not initially overwhelming, but it truly lingers and is a bit choking. Same latex smell as putting on latex gloves, or opening a condom wrapper? When my face is close to it at night, it is pretty irritating and seems to stick on my skin when I leave the bed. This is with just a fitted sheet. You will want to budget for a mattress cover, although I don't know if that will remove the smell completely.Overall, the sensation this latex topper gives is interesting and different from foam, but I am disappointed given the price and reviews. Perhaps heavier folks/non-side sleepers will be more satisfied.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

After a ton of research I settled on this one as I typically don’t like the feel of memory foam and thought latex would be better for me. I especially liked that this gave three options - soft, medium, and firm. I chose soft as I’m a side sleeper and needed pressure relief. The topper came in a timely manner and it was relatively easy to unpack it, it definitely had a smell like latex of course but it wasn’t intense at all and went away once it was in the mattress protector. I unrolled it, shoved it and the mattress into my mattress protector and eventually went to sleep. Unfortunately it isn’t nearly as soft as I’d hoped it would be. To me, it’s relatively uncomfortable. It gives me no pressure relief and I continuously wake up each morning with a sore back. I contemplated returning it but couldn’t fathom how on earth I would get it back in a box now that it’s fully inflated, so I’m just keeping it on my bed for now and will potentially sell it. I would recommend this for the timeliness and the ease of putting it on the mattress plus the fact that the smell really isn’t bad at all, if you’re looking for something soft though, I would not recommend this. I would say it’s more of a medium or firm firmness than anywhere near being soft.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I would rate this latex mattress topper closer to medium rather than soft.  Maybe latex just does not get soft enough.  I even tried folding my topper over to make it 4"" thick, and it was just too firm and springy to be really soft and for my shoulder to sink in comfortably.  I am 6'2"", 180 lbs., so I do not have a whole lot of natural padding.  This might feel softer for someone my height who is over 200 lbs.Aside from being too firm for me, the quality of this topper is good.  It felt good when lying on my back and it did make the bed much softer than it was originally.  The latex had a sweet milky smell for the first week or two, but it faded away after that.  Interestingly, the latex can generate a lot of static when you move it around.My main bed has a plush hybrid mattress, and its memory foam is softer than this latex topper.  I am trying to create a guest bed that is nearly as comfortable without buying an expensive mattress.  I am going to try a plush memory foam topper to see if I can achieve a softer feel.  I know low density memory foam will not last as long as latex, but it is not that expensive to just replace the topper every couple of years rather than replacing the whole mattress.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The directions on choosing were very accurate. Added a lot more comfort to the mattress. A little on the firm side, but no more lumps and bumps. Unfortunately, it’s rather hot. I live in MN and we sleep with windows open so very chilly. We roasted despite the cold in the room. Looked at my husband in the middle of the night and he had no covers on at all. It was about 50 in the room. I deliberately chose the latex over the memory foam because latex doesn’t envelope you when you lay on it. If you’re always cold, you may like it.  Probably shouldn’t write this, but for the $200 price I paid, I decided I could go to _______ and get two feather down comforters and get the feel I’m looking for, no hot sleeping, and way cheaper than buying a feather down mattress topper. Wanted to love this, but nope. Sleeping very well now.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

My husband likes a firm bed; I like a softer bed. (Let's be honest, I'm basically the princess from ""The Princess and the Pea"".) This topper satisfied us both! Firm enough for the support he wanted, but just soft enough with a lovely bounce that it made my sleep blissful.Alas, if only this fairytale mattress topper had a happily ever after, but 'twas not to be. Over time, this mattress topper slowly became less than perfect, and my joints and pressure points started to feel the pain again. And worse, I just found mold growing in it. Isn't latex supposed to be mold/mildew resistant? Maybe this topper was defective, or maybe my environment is so humid as to defy would-be-antimicrobial characteristics.

I had no issues getting the topper on my mattress. The 2” topper was an actual 2” unlock some other advertised products. I was excited to sleep on the mattress and over the last month I can give my honest opinion of the topper.Pros- Doesn’t sink in- Doesn’t lose support or cushioning effect over time- Relieves some pressure points and provides some additional softness vs our firm mattressCons- Sleeps very hot! The first couple of nights were excruciating hot. We have our topper/mattress covered tight a cotton mattress cover and fitted sheet and it was still unbearably hot.  I’ve adjusted a bit over the last month but I’m still uncomfortable. The only way to me this bearable would be to buy an expensive wool mattress topper to go over this latex mattress topper.- Latex smell. The smell is strong and very noticeable. As I stated above ours is covered and you can definitely still smell the latex. It better than memory foam but if you don’t like the smell of latex then you won’t be happy because it doesn’t go away. Another downside to this, is that you will end of smelling like latex as well after sleeping on the topper.Overall the cons outweighs the benefits in my opinion, so I can’t recommend this topper.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We purchased the two-inch version, it's extremely comfy.  Now, the not-so-good.  We have been airing this out for almost three weeks and it still has a chemical odor.  It has dissipated but it is still noticeable.  Every day I pull back the fitted sheet and mattress cover and let it air out through the day.  We live in a very dry climate, which usually helps odors dissipate but we are still having issues.  The sheets and mattress cover also smell of chemicals from the topper.  Finally, it has quite a few pits.  It doesn't impact the comfort but I thought I should point it out in case someone was expecting a perfect piece of latex.  If you have a sensitive nose, I'd pass on this one.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I put a nice, thick mattress pad over it to hold in place. No further damage noted. Changing from 1 to 3.5 stars.Original Review: First off, I'm a long time latex mattress and/or topper user. I've bought latex toppers from a variety of vendors of different price points, softness, and features but never one like this.Pros: Came well packaged, arrived quicklyCons: The pictures tell the story. This topper is soft-- not as in soft-and-comfortable, but as in falling-apart-in your-hand. The chunk from the first photo came out as the topper was removed from the plastic. It literally sheared off and plopped on the floor. If you look at the second photo the holes from the manufacturing process are crooked, uneven, and/or missing in places. Also, there are air holes all over that have nothing to do with the ventilation as in picture 3.Maybe this is a manufacturing defect and only applies to this particular topper? Don't know but I doubt seriously this is going to last long. Trying to get this back in the packaging, and sending this back may not be possible. Really disappointed about this purchase . If it turns out that these issues are only cosmetic and it holds up, I'll come back and change the rating.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

Of course I had to schlep it back into my car and drag it into the store.  There was no way I could stuff it back in the box otherwise.  This mattress pad smelled really bad even after a week of airing out. My sheets smelled even after I washed them.  The latex does what it's supposed to though... give you support while bouncing back vs sinking in. However,  I discovered I like the sinking in feeling of memory foam better. Even the soft latex topper was too hard for me.  I had back pain after sleeping on it for 2 days.  I do not normally have back pain.  But since the company has a good return policy (they will even ship you a return box), I say try it if you're looking for firm support and a cooler surface. I really wanted it to work for me since my T&N foam mattress was so warm.  I heard latex is cooler than foam and memory foam.  It just didn't work for me. Fyi, I'm a very small,  light weight person (105 lbs).  Maybe I don't weigh enough for this type of mattress. I switched back to memory foam even though it runs warmer than latex. But it's still cooler than regular foam.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

J.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2020","For years we had a latex topper as a ""comfort layer"" on our firm bed.  We loved it but eventually it started to wear out, so we ordered a medium weight 2"" topper from Sleep On Latex about a year and a half ago.  Our other topper had been a medium weight, 1 1/2"".  The one that came was so hard that eventually I could not sleep on it at all and decided to order the soft, which we cut in half and cut the other one in half so that one side would be a soft topper for me and my husband would keep sleeping on the supposed medium Sleep On Latex topper.  However, the supposedly soft topper is nearly as hard as their medium one, and much harder than our original medium topper from another company.  I understand that technically the Sleep On Latex topper must be a higher quality because there must be more material per square inch in order for it to be harder.  That is little consolation however if I can't get any rest on it.  So now, hundreds of dollars later, we're going to have to get something else entirely.  I gave this 3 stars simply because I understand that this is high quality, not because I can sleep on it.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I got one before from Pure Green directly but it was too thick. But this one I got has a much stronger smell that has lasted months and has black specks on one side. They are hard too. I think it could be a second and being sold as though is a normal fully functional one?  I decided to sleep on the non black speck side. But I am a bit concerned about what these could be. I sure hope not bugs. I am thinking maybe some sort of natural plant product. But the one I got directly from the store did not have any of these markings or things on it.The only bonus to getting it on Amazon is the shipping is much faster. That is why I tried it this way this time.It has a plastic latex smell that is more so in warm weather or when heater is on. Seems it should have gone away or not been here at all. I have a latex mattress that never had any smell and tried out a few other latex mattresses and they did not have any odor either.Maybe if one uses a cover for it that would solve that problem but then you would not feel the latex enough.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I aired it out for several days in a room with a window open and the door closed and it stank up the room and any fabric it touched. A sweet rubbery smell--not quite like tires. I used it anyway, hoping multiple layers of memory foam and mattress pad would help, but I started getting bad headaches. Kohls made it fairly easy to return--I didn't have to stuff it back in the box. OTHER NOTES: The topper didn't make my ultra firm mattress more bearable, but it did improve my basic old sleep number bed. As a result, I think this is better for giving new life to a broken-down mattress rather than lessening the firmness of a mattress. As others noted, the softest topper is still firm. I used an egg crate topper and a thick mattress pad on top to alleviate pressure points. The topper attracts hair like a magnet; had to use a lint roller to get all my hair off. I'm an average sized woman of average strength and I was able to manage this by myself. Opening the box on the bed and unrolling it on the bed helped a lot. It's more unwieldy than heavy.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

For the first 6 months it was super. 6 months later it has compressed and you can see that there is a deep area where my wife and I sleep with a big ""hump"" between us. The neck and shoulder pain has returned.  I'm pretty heavy  but the ""dips"" are in both sides of the bed. We tried flipping it and that didn't work. We tried spinning it so the foot was at the head and that didn't work. We are thinking that we ordered the wrong firmness but this topper was so nice for 6 months.

I had a 4 year old pillow top mattress that started to sag. Started getting back pain and I knew I needed a former matteress and never a pillow top again.Bought a firm Simmons and soon found it to be too hard. I read alot and settled on this after a few days reading.  It shipped quick and was well packaged. I began sleeping in it the day it arrived a week ago. My back pain went away when I got this and I sleep like a dream until the alarm goes off.  It has a hint of a latex smell, bit not bad. After all it is latex. It is not obnoxious and I am the one who is usually sensitive to smells......After a year I started getting back pain again.  I took off the sheets and found the latex topper had an impression of my body. Its not supposed to do that, but it does. Buyer beware. These things work great for a while, but they do fail at about a year. Also price doubled in last year so not economical to replace them.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I suggest If you are ordering more than 1 order them at the same time. I have a split king adjustable bed. So I needed 2 twin xl toppers. I ordered 1 to see if I liked it and it was perfect. Soft and supportive. I ordered the 2nd one and had to sent it back because it was a little thicker and not as soft as the 1st one. The holes that were in the topper did not perforate all the way through. I think that caused it to be a little firmer than the first. Custom services says the holes aren't supposed to all the way through. My husband really loved the 1st one so after I returned the 2nd one. I bought a 3rd one. It was much better than the 2nd one but still not as good as the 1st one.  It is the same thickness as the 1st one unlike the 2nd one and in some spots the holes went all the way through and in other spots they didn't.  Because of their inconsistency I give it 3 stars.,2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

My biggest complaint is the odor!  I had to wrestle with it every so often to turn it over and leave it in my garage for a month to outgas.  Fortunately, it has a plastic cover and I would drag it out into the sun to bake it.  It did not seem to be cured enough when I got it.  I even treated it with an ozone machine.Overall, latex is superb for sleeping and will last for decades with no degradation or memory lumps.  My bed consists of a 4"" firm topper, and a 3"" medium topper, and finally a 2"" soft topper, on my previous bed's platform.  No more sagging springs, chemical fire treatments, allergies, and bug feces-accumulating synthetic conventional bed for me.  Order only 100% organic latex and be careful of additives or synthetics.  Also, get organic cotton and wool bed coverings and you're set for years of healthy sleep!  LATEX ROCKS!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The topper does away with that feeling like we're ""in a hole"" and is very comfortable, BUT although all king-size beds are standard, this topper is about 4-5"" wider than the mattress.  That means we'll have to trim it because right now, it hangs over on both sides which not only makes it harder for the sheets to stay on, but it makes the edge of the bed feel unstable which isn't good when added to the height of the bed.  It's very heavy so unless you're a pretty strong person, you'll need two of you to move it around and get it on top of the bed.  Otherwise, if you like a soft feel to your mattress, this is wonderful.  My hips and shoulders are much happier.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After getting sticker shock and being overwhelmed by all the mattress options I found a website that compares mattresses, mattress toppers and pillows. The site stated that for heavier people, side sleepers and couples this was one of the best options.  We decided after reading some of the other very helpful reviews on here to go with the queen 3"" soft topper. It came in a smallish VERY heavy box (so if you have trouble lifting items make sure you will have help when this is delivered to you!)  We opened and unrolled the topper. We didn't leave it to air out because it was nearly bedtime, and I felt like the smell wasn't too awful. We have just regular depth fitted sheets and I was sure they wouldn't fit after seeing just how thick the mattress topper really was- however the sheets fit well. After sleeping on and changing the sheets sets several times now I am impressed that I din't have to go out and buy special fitted sheets to accommodate the topper! No problems at all with a normal fitted sheet covering both the mattress and topper, and absolutely no problems with the fitted sheet staying on all night over the topper.  5 stars for not making my life difficult!  As far as the smell, while it did smell some when opening- the smell has faded and is no longer an issue at all. 5 stars for not making me gag!  The comfort of the topper is very impressive. I was kind of anticipating comfort at first when laying down, but then throughout the night it not being as comfortable simply from being compressed by 2 bodies for hours. This is not at all the case! The topper remains comfortable all night long, not too springy and not too squishy. I was concerned that buying the soft topper would be too marshmallow-y, but I've got to say- I am so thankful we went with soft and not the medium! I thought being too soft would not give enough support and cause our backs to hurt, but it has done very well supporting and not overly cloudlike! 5 stars for comfort and support!  Now, the negative.... we bought and started using this topper in January, during a particularly frigid winter, often below zero. Our bedroom is very cold, and I have trouble staying warm no matter how many blankets we have! After adding the topper to our bed, I find myself kicking off some covers and waking because I am too warm. This worries me since it's winter and I'm too warm, what will it be like in the summer when our underinsulated room is hot? I am thinking the amount of body heat the synthetic topper holds may make sleeping in warmer conditions really unpleasant. So 4 stars (for now) for holding in heat and disrupting sleep. I will update in the summer, hopefully I won't have to knock off more stars!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I needed to add some cushion on top of an old memory foam mattress that was rock solid. This mattress pad is very comfortable. My only complaint is that it had a terribly strong latex scent for about 8 months before it faded. Another complaint is that this thing retains heat like nobodys business. It'll be 60 degrees in the room and you are sweating in bed because this thing heats up as if it were a heating bla ket underneath you. I still give it a 4 out of 5 because its just that comfortable. I dont regret buying it as I've had some really good sleep on this thing (especially in the winter). It's just uncomfortably hot in the summer.,1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's not comfortable anymore.  My plan was to purchase this 2"" soft latex topper then eventually purchase a queen Sleep on Latex medium mattress.  Skip ahead and it looks like I'll not be getting the mattress after all due to cost.  The topper was almost immediately helpful with the comfort with the Casper (I'm a side sleeper) but after a few months the back issues I was having are starting to return.  Most likely what I'll do is get a cheaper medium firm 6"" or 8"" mattress that is fiberglass free and use latex 2"" topper as the ""comfort"" layer.  I 100% would recommend this topper for anyone not wanting to breath in the chemicals from the memory foam or infused toppers.  Out of the box the latex topper had a slight smell but to me it was enjoyable.  It reminded me of my Japanese futon I had many years ago.  Sadly, it went away after a few days.  I purchased just the topper without any cover.  If I had to do it over again I would have purchased the cover, however, the $65 difference in price would be hard to swallow.  I'm still holding out hope that I can get a queen latex mattress but if not this topper should work well with an alternative firmer mattress.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I didn't buy the cover since I already have a mattress cover with deep pockets that fit just fine. I was in so much shoulder pain, and also frustrated because we had just purchased an organic,spring form,locally handmade mattress from a mom and pop shop because my back was hurting so bad from a once loved memory foam bed that started to sink. Getting a new bed takes a lot of time and research, it's very stressful because you want to get it right. Well as my back was getting better with the new mattress my shoulders started to hurt to the point of sleepless nights. I was so disappointed and frustrated that I bought this very expensive bed of nails,  until I bought this latex mattress topper. What a difference it's making, that 1st night I slept all the way through until morning without shoulder pain. The topper is definitely soft and kinda pillow-ey but thick enough to support my shoulders and whole body, I'm 57 year old woman with some extra weight on me and this topper allows me to sleep through the night. I still have joint pain during the day but this topper has made sleeping easier for 3 months now. If your wondering whether or not to get it, I say go for it.

We also have been using their Alexander Signature 2"" memory foam mattress topper.  My wife has become an increasingly hot sleeper and we ended up getting the Eight Sleep water cooling topper last year.  It was terribll uncomfortable when we put it on top of everything so we ended up putting it between the bed and the NestBedding topper and it was able to provide some cooling relief at night for her.Some time after, however, I started having some lower back pain and I began to notice it was worse every morning and I could almost feel it hurting at night due to lack of support from the mushy topper.  When I took the topper off completely the pain slowly went away but then we weren't using the Eight Sleep cooling unit and my wife was miserable.  Because of this we started looking at toppers again and I read a good review on this one and saw that they allowed free returns through Amazon so decided to give the 1"" unit a shot.  Specifically because latex is known for being more firm I thought it would contrast with the Nest Bedding topper that was too mushy and give me the support I needed.It arrived quickly and appears to be made very well in general.  However, it was just a little bit too firm.  I didn't hate it but it just felt like it was pushing up on my hip when I was sleeping on my side a little too much.  My wife, who is also a very light sleeper and wakes up at everything ever since we had kids, really noticed that every time I would get in or out of be or move around at all that she felt like she was being jostled around and would wake up.  Noticeably more so than without the topper or with the old squishy one.We decided to try out the 1.5"" Serta gel memory foam topper for 1/3rd of the price and were a lot happier overall and decided to return this topper.  The return process was easy (it's a lot easier to repack Latex in the box than memory foam) and they issued the refund right away.  Perhaps a thicker topper would have been a little softer and transfer less motion than the 1"" one we tried.  If you're interested in trying a latex topper I think it could be a good option with the easy returns but I'd recommend the 2"" or 3"" one.  Giving 4 stars for shipping and return process and quality build of the mattress itself.  Loses one star because I personally didn't find the 1"" variety comfortable.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The 2” soft topper works great as it softens the blow to my shoulders and hips while sleeping. I would not be able to use this bed without this latex topper.  But, this same topper was waaay too soft for my somewhat firm, “regular”, twin mattress. My body sunk into the bed which made me very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I didn't know why there was a difference with the two different size toppers but later realized that my twin bed was softer and more giving than I thought. An additional 2"" of a soft topper was just too much cushy-ness. With my spouse, we were ultimately able to get it back in the box that it came in. We initially folded it and put it back in the bag and tried to vacuum the air out. We weren’t t successful , but if we had a spare, large,  packing bag it would have worked.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Take a whiff inside a latex glove to compare before purchasing.  Smell stays in your skin.  Very, very heavy.  Told to return in original packaging which is impossible since latex expands as soon as you free the product from machine wrapped plastic.  You'd have to be Houdini to get it back into the original box.  Had to call Amazon to find out how to return.  Had to purchase extra large shipping box Home Depot.  Then pay $12.99 for UPS to pick up since it is so heavy.  As for comfort, added some padding but nothing to write home about.  Make absolutely sure this is what you want before going through the hassle of ""free"" return.Company explained after product returned that they would have provided the large box and shipped the return for free if contacted directly.  No one told me beforehand and they said they will rectify the situation with Amazon.  Also reimbursed my costs for return.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Very comfortable, not too thick, no noxious smell, breathable, etc. My problem is that even though I rotate it several times a month, it has developed valleys. Now when I roll over, there's a noticeable change in elevation. Not the end of the world, but disappointing as I liked it so much at first. I've never used a mattress topper before, so maybe this is common, but I can't see buying a new one every year as that's just insanely wasteful. I guess I'll keep looking for something more permanent.

Firm.I opened the shipping box and it definitely had a “mild” [to me] odor. After removing it from the box and taking off the shrink wrap, the odor was stronger. From past experiences with foam toppers (regular & latex) it is a less offensive smell when compared to typical non-latex foam toppers and mattresses, which had a pungent chemical / petroleum smell.After 24 hours with an overhead fan above, the majority of off-gassing was over. After moving it onto the mattress, there was a mild odor, but it was definitively tolerable.Last night was our first night’s sleep. We both felt initially that it was firm, however I fell asleep quickly and never woke up until AM. In the morning I was rested and had zero pain from my shoulders, neck and back! Wow! Sleeping through the night is miraculous in itself, but to do so pain-free is next level goodness for me. The shoulder pain, from foam toppers, was at a point it lasted most of the day. I can attest to —> so far, so good!  Four ⭐️ for now, we’ll see in 6 months and a year from now how well it holds up and delivers pain free, uninterrupted sleep.Update 6/6/23. I noticed the mattress has imperfections. I contacted the seller and sent them pics to inquire if it was “normal” or a current or future problem. They made the judgment call to send a replacement topper plus a box and label to return the original. That was exceptional customer service!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I, on the other hand, rebuilt my bed, literally.. So a few years back the wife and I bought a brand new Vera Wang mattress from a box store at a ""great price"". It was nice, everyone slept great, for about a year...  Then we tossed and turned as it slowly started to sink in the two spots we normally slept.  Warranty to the rescue!  They come out, they measure the ""dents"", claim it as bad and tell us to come get another mattress.  But wait, why not just bring us another?  ""Oh that one was a special discount price, we can only give you store credit for it...""  Well so much for my great price...  So now I'm stuck with a cheaper one unless I wanted to pay more instore, yay.  This one lasts a few years but eventually failed again and this time we're into the ""pro-rated warranty"" period.  So do I get an even cheaper mattress from the store?  No.  This time I researched and researched until I'd learned enough to never buy a box store mattress again.  But I also learned why my mattress failed and what was still good in my mattress, the box spring foundation.  And just like in houses, if the foundation is good, you can rebuild anything.So I completely disassembled my old mattress, and bought 3 things.1.  A proper bed frame (also from Amazon)2.  An awesome ticking (it's a mattress term, look it up!) that was zippered and washable3.  This Dunlop based 100% natural 3"" Latex Mattress Topper!!So I took apart my mattress and chunked the old ticking and crappy top layer of foam that had died and caused all the problems from the get go.  Then I put the bottom spring foundation into my new ticking, then the still functional piece of foam from the old mattress, then this Awesome piece of Latex!  And you know what!  I was too damned stiff for me...  Now the wife loved it, but just a little too much stiffness for my sleeping taste.  So unzipped the ticking and swapped the foam and latex so that the foam was on top and the latex was in the middle.  BAMM!! Sleepy Awesomeness for All!!!So yes, this drunken fool cut up his mattress and rebuilt it like a 65 Mustang, from the ground up.  And you know what?  That was 3 months ago and we've been sound sleeping ever since.So why the 4 stars?? Because this thing said and I just can't call this anything but medium, maybe medium/soft...  But other then that, it's been very much so an awesome addition to my bed rebuild project.  I just hope they'll make an extra soft 1"" version I can use to cover this one once the standard foam I put on top wears out.And why does this thing smell like a Sweet Vanilla Milkshake???",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

So I will give them a 4 star instead of the 2 star on my previous rating for good customer service. Reasons for not a full 5 stars is due to the prolonging smell. It still smells eventhough it has been aired out, at least 2 weeks now. It has an earthy tree like strong smell. Also, I have the other toppers from the same seller, and they aren't exactly the same length (all full size topper). It's slightly off and not even, but I guess it's ok. Just have to make it work. Overall it feels comfortable.5/21/2023The other toppers came out fine but this one when fully opened has a torn spot. The topper is a 2in with soft comfort. It firmness is soft so it feels very light and flimsy compared to the medium and firm topper. Of course it has an odor which needs to air out. When I try to move it on top of another topper, I feel afraid as I would end up ripping it because it feels cheap? Good thing I bought the other level of firmness or this soft firmness is a no go.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Being very sensitive to smells, I was worried bc I had recently purchased a supposedly all natural latex pillow, and altho comfortable, had a bad strong smell.  I learned later that all natural could still mean it had toxic fillers.  First I want to say that this topper is very quality latex, it had a very very slight fresh smell is the way I would describe it, but not at all like the pillow I have.  I honestly think the smell is nice and I am very sensitive.  To protect, we laid a duvet cover we had on top of it,  then placed a sheet on top of that, and putting my head to the topper could not smell anything at all the very first day.  This was very important.  We purchased the 3 inch soft and the feel is nice, tho still a little firm.  So right now my husband is up in the air about whether he wants to get a Talalay which he thinks will be softer.  I feel it is nice, and gives the perfect amount of comfort.  I am a back sleeper and partial side, and find myself sleeping more on my side now.  A couple of aches and pains I was having in my back and neck have improved also.  I am giving 4 stars bc I wish it had come with a cover, and also bc it is hard to handle, very large, heavy, etc.  But I want to say that this is what they say it is, quality latex, no toxins which was very important.  Other places are selling toppers with covers for twice the price.  I even have seen them for 3 times the price so I think this topper is a good deal, and this is reputable place to purchase your latex toppers.  I do want to note that many toppers are made of Talalay tho, not Dunlop like this one, which is used bc it is slightly softer.  This one has a rating of 20 so consider that.  It did make my bed softer though and still gave support.  I also believe that Talalay has a tendency to not be as pure and so that was a worry for me, having had that bad smell experience with the Talalay pillow I bought.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I have a latex mattress that had a sagging, poly pillow top, so I decided to cut off the top, and add a new topper. I selected this to serve as the top. I contacted the seller for product advice, and I also contacted a foam mattress production expert I know, and he said that, for the price and quality claims, this is a great deal.They were right! It's perfect! As a side sleeper, I need cushion to prevent the pressure points I had before. I would say this is medium-soft, as it has a lot of elasticity, while still being dense and supportive. I do bottom out a little, though, so I might get the 2"" medium for underneath. I weigh 270 pounds, by the way.For centering this on your mattress, I highly recommend a technique that another reviewer suggested- lifting and shaking/fluffing it, like you would a sheet or comforter. It utilizes the bounce and elasticity of the foam, while spreading it out. That was really the only way to get it on the bed right without ripping it into pieces, and also the way I recenter it from shifting. Also, I got a wool mattress pad to replace my waterproof one (which was making me sweat- this thing sleeps HOT), and it has elastic bands that keep my topper in place.  Makes things WAAAAAAAAY easier. If you can, I suggest a pillow top protector that has the elastic bands.UPDATE: five months in, I had a bit of an issue with the topper beginning to sag. I contacted the seller, sent them pics, and they immediately sent me a new one. They stand by their product, and provide excellent customer service! Four stars, would be three, but they get an extra for customer service. We'll see how long this one lasts- latex foam is supposed to last years!*The first replacement they sent was warped at the bottom, from being compressed too long. They immediately sent a second one.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

So odds are one size or another will work for you.  Some other reviewers have reported that it smells, that theirs was cut wrong, and that it is hot.  Quality control appears to be an issue.  However, my 3 inch queen topper came as advertised (60 x 80).  Two very (very) minor flaws.  I rolled it out on my mattress and it appeared to be fully inflated within minutes.  I gave it a couple of hours, but only because it was lunch time.  There is a mild odor.  However, I put a waterproof covering on it, put an electric mattress pad warmer on top of that, and a padded mattress pad on top of that to keep from feeling the electric wiring in the warmer.  No more odor.  It seems to be helping to reduce/eliminate my morning hip/back pain. My problem, however, isn't spinal, it is in the muscles in my lower back.  Just FYI,  I weigh 205 pounds, and while the two inch might have worked just fine, I'm happy I spent a few extra bucks on the three inch.  It works for me, but with this topper you pay your money and take your chances. Odds are in your favor.  They seem to have a generous return policy, but at 35 pounds, at 76 years of age, and with back problems I'm really glad it worked because there was no way I was going to wrestle it back to the UPS store.  Oh, I turned my mattress warmer off  after sever hours and had to turn it back on later in the night because I was cold.  The topper  didn't soak up my body heat, but then there were several layers of cloth  between me and the latex.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

We bought a tempurpedic Loft king bed, listed as soft, but it felt like a brick to us. We started with a 4in visco foam topper to soften it up. It did, too much. It was like sinking into quicksand, it was hot, there was a smell, and strangely, it felt like you were rolling off the edge of the bed if you weren’t in the center. It was like it cut down the width of our bed by several inches. It was so difficult to move on that I’d find my shoulder going numb during the night because I wasn’t changing positions normally. So we decided to try this one. I noticed it’s more brittle, almost “dry” feeling so I had to be careful when I was moving it because if you pull on it, it WILL TEAR. It’s got some bounce, nothing like memory foam. There’s no sinking in. I don’t get the feeling of sleeping on a cloud. It’s supportive, but not really conforming, more cushioning. It’s not hot to sleep on, works on our adjustable bed, and the smell wasn’t bad and went away as soon as the protector was on. I’d say, if you know you want latex and you know what to expect, this is an excellent value. If you’re not sure what the differences are but want something soft, try to find a store with a latex bed sample to try first. I wouldn’t call this topper soft, but my husband who loves a firm mattress thinks it’s perfect and calls it “a soft medium” so for couples, this is likely a good pick. We will definitely be keeping it, and we’ve noticed improved sleep, no pain, and the bed feels great, but I think to get that plush (but not mush) luxury hotel bed feeling, maybe adding a mattress pad will do it.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I had to take it off the bed. It still works really well for reducing overall aches and pains for sure, but I was definitely waking up from being too warm. I would need to adjust bed position to allow it to cool off and had to adjust several times a night.  Too bad because I do think it was comfortable.I bought this about 6 or so months ago. I tried it a few nights and I was too hot so I just stopped using it pretty quickly.  Fast forward to now and I decided to try again because my  back pain and joint pain were getting worse, I thought from now working at home and poor posture. I also recently purchased some Bamboo ""cooling"" sheets and a similar cover for a weighted blanket that I had also previously stopped using.  (I don't sleep well, I am always in search of how to sleep better).  Much to my surprise, my back and joint pain started improving immediately.  After several days, I now am so much less stiff, its actually amazing which is what made me decide to review as I read reviews for every purchase and appreciate them.  But I'm still hot - just not any more hot than I think using anything else.  I am also using a weighted blanket again.  So if you are considering this for pain then I say give it a go.  If you are a hot sleeper, this is not part of a solution but I don't know that it made anything worse!",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I have Fibromyalgia and my old mattress was making me toss and turn. I'd wake up in pain having hardly slept. I researched the heck out of the issue. Went down to a mattress store and tried out hybrid, gel and memory foam mattresses. I read hundreds of comments on every mattress , ALL the brands, as well as help sites for my condition. The most common recommendation was to get a Beautyrest BLACK mattress and then put a 3"" latex topper on it. The cost of doing that is rather high. A major investment. Plus there were TONS of complaints on Beautyrest, Simmons and Serta. Seems like everything else these days mattresses are designed to give out after only a few years so you have to buy another one. So, I decided to try this PURE GREEN 100% Natural Latex Topper on my old Thomasville bed first. It works just fine. I'm not buying a $3000 mattress when this pad is all I need! Everyone recommended the ""SOFT"" version and they are right! I would call this medium-firm myself. You do not sink into Latex. You sleep on top of it and it adapts to your body springing back as you move around. It's easy to move on. I am now not only comfortable but am sleeping a full 6 consecutive hours a night which is phenomenal for me. I got the Sleep Ease cover for it which has a side that is supposed to keep the pad stationery on your mattress. It helps but the topper still gradually slide off the bed. It does make it easier to grab and pull it back on straight. SAn Amazon reviewer recommended putting a RUG pad underneath and that does work. There is NO smell. The quality is good. I got a Queen and it is slightly smaller than my bed. Looks to me like the  latex was just cut off a big roll. My 13"" deep fitted sheets still fit. It comes rolled and compressed in a box. I left it out on the living room floor for a few nights to flatten out but am not sure that was really necessary. Recommended.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I was hoping to get another year out of what I have now, so I purchased this topper and a wool topper to try to minimize the nightly overheating.  I've got both on my bed now (and also a cooling mattress pad from Sheetz) so hard to say how much of a difference each component has made, but I'm sleeping much better now.  My biggest complaint about this pad (and hence the 4 stars) is that it hangs over the queen mattress too much.  They should've taken off 2"" from each side so that it fits on top of the mattress instead of hanging over!  WTH  it's the little things that make something good into something awesome.  I do not think a 2"" latex topper would be enough of a difference if you wanted to change the feel of your current mattress.  I don't know the purpose of a 1"" at all unless you're a sprite or weigh 10 lbs.  So depending on why you're purchasing, you might want to look at the 3"".  If like me, you're just trying to minimize overheating at night the 2"" would probably be fine.I have the topper under a mattress pad, on top of which I put the wool topper right under the sheets, so the overhang on the pad just makes the edge of the bed feel weird.  So far, it is working for me along with my other purchases to make my sleep at night much more pleasant.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We had a memory foam topper for a few hrs but due to neck & back problems it was just too soft. So after much research, we ordered the medium firm topper.  Way too hard! Tried sleeping on it for 2 nights & couldn't do it. Was much too firm. So I returned it & ordered the soft & it's great. This material (latex) is different than memory foam - you don't sink in. Soft isn't really that soft & you don't sink in too much.  They only have soft, medium firm & firm but soft is still fairly firm. Also on both toppers we layed then out in the garage on a sheet x 2 days in case they smelled bad (from others' reviews) but neither did.Now re the return - wow lol. These come in a big box & they are vacuumed sealed. We tried & tried to put it back into the original box but there was no way.  Two grown men + me tried to squish it in there & it just became humorous. So we had to get a huge box (used one that a ventahood came in! Next step was gonna be a refrigerator box!) to send it back. Took up my whole back seat when I lugged it down to UPS. Glad I didn't have to return the 2nd one as Amazon charged us nearly $30 to return this beast!  So hope this helps those of you considering this topper!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

What I would do different next time - buy 2 twin size long instead of a king. Why? Because there is motion transfer with latex that you don't get with memory foam. It's like laying on gelatin. Someone else said this in their review, and I wasn't sure what to make of it; however, after sleeping on it, I would describe it the same way.Our memory foam pad had met the end of its life - about 3 years. I was having pressure points hurting again. I debated and debated on what to get. What sold me on the latex was its durability. I shouldn't have to replace it every 2-3 years as we do with memory foam toppers.I do find this mattress topper to be comfortable. My hold back from 5 stars is the motion and the fact I can still smell latex. I'm not sure how to stop that. If you aren't sure what latex smells like, it's just like latex balloons or condoms.I have a slightly padded mattress pad on top of the latex topper as a protector more than anything.I'm 5'9 150 lbs. My husband is 5'10"" and 190 lbs. He loves it and said it was a big improvement.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Luckily, I was able to borrow an air mattress and as I lay stiffly on its creaking, air-hard surface, I knew I had to do something.  I love latex products.  I've been using this miraculous substance as a pillow for years and years.  So I knew what I was getting into when I purchased this topper.  Queen sized and 3"" high, it comes as a completely manageable 35 lb roll that even 5' me can get into my place and rolled out onto the mattress.  It's rough going trying to find a fitted sheet that will cover a mattress, a pad and this topper, but completely necessary for reasonably good sleep.  It's not the same as my old Beautyrest NxG but the thing was toast and had to go.  I will rest easy in latex limbo until I figure out my next living situation.  For $200, it's a worthwhile 4 stars.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Everyone is different with various issues and in the end you really don’t know what’s best for you until you sleep on it.Here goes my experience. I hope it helps.....It was difficult removing the air tight plastic wrap.  Due to my medical issues my friend took care this and the set up.  Once he removed the wrapping, he placed it in an encased box spring cover (it was all I had).  That was a task and in the process pieces of the topper were coming off.  It appears the topper is slightly larger than my full size bed, but not enough to be a major issue.I ordered the soft, but it wasn’t the soft feel I was expecting but after a nights sleep, I woke up with a lot less pain from the chronic back and neck pain I deal with 24/7.  It provides great support and made a major difference from the hard orthopedic uncomfortable bed I own.  So far, it’s been a lot better than my bed but I would have rather a slightly softer feel and for this reason only I give it 4 stars.FYI: I’ve only had it for a few days",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It took a lot of experimentation; I initially opted for a firm & medium firm combo and it truly felt like sleeping on the floor, even with the 2-inch memory foam on top. I gave it a few nights, hoping I'd adjust, but the pain all through my back was unbearable. I initiated a return and Sleep on Latex sent me a large box that could easily accommodate the firm topper. They never mentioned they'd knock $15 off my refund for return shipping so I deducted a star for that reason. Disappointing.However, replacing the firm topper with this soft one really worked out for me. No more back pain, no pressure points, no tossing and turning. Even as someone who loves a soft bed, I think this is best used in combination with the medium firm topper (or a firm mattress) but everyone's preferences will differ.Overall, I recommend this brand and especially recommend the layering approach if you're attempting mattress surgery. You'll appreciate the opportunity to adjust the layers as you figure out what works for you.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The gel foam topper was purchased because we were having shoulder, hip, knee pain from the firmness of the so called ""plush"" mattress.The gel topper is good but the issue we were having is that when your body heat warms the topper you sink AND your body heat radiates from compressed gel topper back to your body and doesn't allow the heat to escape until you move. Usually repositioning results from pain from compressed topper if not prompted by the warmth.We have a second mattress (latex & foam/springs that was awesome for years now18 yrs old, did cost $3000 at the time ). The 2nd mattress was flipped over (ones they say you cant flip) but it was so bad it was flip it or throw it out.  Bought the 2"" Latex topper placed it on the flipped mattress and its about 70% better.  The LATEX topper is COOL and doesn't radiate heat back to your body, bouncier, but was worth not throwing out our 2nd mattress.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

To my surprise, when I unwrapped it from the plastic it quickly rolled out and was immediately to size!Completely shocked. It was really cool. If you have kids let them watch it pop to life.They do sell a nice cover for it however I have it under a mattress protector so I don't see a need.The smell was strong, however it didn't give me issues leave on the bed and sleeping on it the first night. Within a few nights I no longer noticed smell at all. Yay!Yes I still have constant pain, but it is not amplified by mattress anymore. Compared to memory foam that is under it it breathes a little better. Hot flashes are less intense and bed isn't soaked as before. I wouldn't say it's cooling though.Material has amazing bounce back similar to unrolling. While it was still on the floor I walked on it and jumped on it and it provided cushion, a little spring, and followed foot up as it was lifted. Memory foam doesn't return quickly and is NOT soft to quickly fall into.I like that this is a USA company and it is using natural material. Even not having cover saves when it is not needed.If you need a soft-med mattress because you have sore hips, knees, back, definitely consider this. Due to the amount of spring back and from what I've read about latex I'm looking forward to this lasting much longer then my cheap foam topper that was replaced on top of memory foam.What is great about getting twin sizes is you can have different toppers on each side of the bed depending on each person's needs.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We innocently decided to shop for a new king-size mattress after going on vacation and sleeping great, then returning home and realizing it was time for our old mattress to be put out to pasture. We bought a medium-priced Beautyrest firm pillowtop from Macy's, and spent a miserable month tossing and turning until Macy's agreed to send a technician out to inspect.  He determined we had 1-1/2"" body impressions on each side, and we're average sized folks. Crazy! After some haggling, we were able to return the mattress and box springs for a full refund and our quest continued. After MUCH reading on the internet, I discovered that mattresses are no longer made as in days of old - they cannot be flipped, and body impressions are very common within the first year because the memory foam that most are made from, does not spring back. We spent a day at Bedrooms and More in Seattle, a company that makes their own mattresses ""the old way"". The one we bought is a firm innerspring, tight-top (not pillowtop). It's a great place to shop, with reasonable prices. They even have a free mattress class that you can take before you buy, and encouraged us to turn the mattress 90 degrees once per month for 2 months, then flip over and start again. This will help avoid the lumps, bumps and dips over time.  However, the mattress is still a bit too firm for our liking, so I took the plunge and ordered the 2"" soft, king-size Pure Green latex topper from Amazon.  What a dream!!  From the very first night, we both slept great, and the topper molded to hips, shoulders and elbows nicely, as we're both side-sleepers. It has really helped my arthritis pain. It is springy (but not annoyingly so), is not hot at all (like memory foam), and keeps its shape.  It's so comfortable that I don't want to get up in the morning!  I had a few questions, so I contacted the Sleep On Latex company thru the Amazon website, and had an answer from the owner within 24 hours!  Amazing. The moral of this story is - buy a firm innerspring mattress, and add a latex topper. Or, revitalize a tired mattress with a latex topper and you can buy yourself some time. The next thing on my wish list is a wool mattress pad...and a new topper for the RV - then we're all set!  Thanks for reading this long post. I had no idea that mattress shopping would be so complicated and hope this information will help someone else.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I borrowed the 2"" after she raved so much about it. We both suffer from a connective tissue disorder that makes sleep uncomfortable. We wake constantly with subluxations (body parts that slip out of place), having to shift, roll over, etc., at least 20 times a night which can get old really fast. I borrowed the 2"" topper from her spare room and had the best sleep of my life for two nights! I usually wake up at a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale in the morning until I can take my meds, but with this topper, I wake up at a 2 or a 3 out of 10 on the pain scale, which is huge!!!! I immediately ordered my own.I went bigger, however, and purchased the 3"" soft topper instead of the 2"" soft topper that I'd borrowed from my sister. I thought that bigger would be better! Unfortunately, I was wrong. When the 3"" soft topper arrived, I realized that it was a *touch* too deep for me. It had the same soft/wonderful/cool support that feels like sleeping on a cloud, but it put me into a position that was awful.  I have to sleep on my side with a king pillow wedged in behind me for support, as well as a king pillow in front for support. I use a gel pillow under my head and the 3"" topper was *just* deep enough that it tilted my head just a fraction beyond what is comfortable for my body and I was in agony :( I was so sad! I wanted it to work so badly but I couldn't bear it after a few nights as it was just a tiny bit too tall. (My spouse said the 3"" was the same as the 2"" just to give you some reference. I was the only one that noticed the change!) This is where the review gets awesome.I emailed the company, and literally within minutes, they responded. I had a return started with Amazon, they were shipping me a box big enough to return it (because my overzealous spouse had already recycled the BIG box that the 3"" topper came in), and I purchased the 2"" soft topper. In just a few days, I received the box, packed up the 3"" topper to return, and had the new 2"" topper on my bed. Sleep on Latex ordered a UPS pick up at my home at no cost to me, and I happily pushed the big box onto the front porch and went upstairs to flop down on my bed in relief.There were about eight emails back and forth to coordinate the logistics, and this was HANDS DOWN the best customer service I have ever received. Like, EVER! And that, to me as a consumer, is invaluable. They listened, responded, and problem-solved like pros.Oh, and I almost forgot....I didn't order the zippered cover when I bought the first 3"" topper. I realized that I wanted it when I read other reviews about how much easier it made moving it around on the bed (it's super hard for me to bend over, and anything that makes my life easier to shift the thing around on my mattress is great. The topper is kind of...well....latex-ish when you don't have a cover on it so it's maybe 20% harder to move around on a big bed by myself. Don't get me wrong, it's not difficult, just...active. Putting sheets on the bed flows better when the cover is on, too! But you def don't NEED the cover if you don't want it. A mattress protector or other top sheet would be just fine if you don't want to spend the money, but the cover really does improve my experience with the topper. I don't share other reviews' frustration with the zip-off top, I thought it was very clever! That way, I can just zip off the top, wash it, and zip it back on without flopping the topper around by myself. Very smart!) Anyway, I ordered the cover, and my new 2"" topper ARRIVED ALREADY INSIDE THE COVER. How great is that?!? Seriously. I appreciated that extra step SO MUCH and almost cried when I opened the box to see that. To me, that goes above and beyond what any company is required to do. That extra step meant so much.So, long review short, this 2"" soft topper is a game-changer. I love it. It's worth every penny and I want to purchase them for every bed in my home.  It takes my already-bowed five-year-old memory foam mattress from sucky to amazing. The zip-off topper cover makes my life easier. The topper makes my nights better. It's just bouncy enough, my spouse doesn't feel my move around, it's nice and cool, and feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud. It keeps my pressure points supported, my bones don't slip out of place, I wake up rested and almost pain-free, and it's easy to maintain. (Oh, and because nobody else has mentioned it, it doesn't take away from romantic time, either :) )Buy this product. And buy it from this company. I'm so grateful!!! Thank you SleeponLatex!!!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I just got the soft one and it really is wonderful. My body feels gently cradled, and I can side sleep now with comfort. Unlike previous toppers that smelled of terrible chemicals and that needed aerating for weeks prior to use, these came with a slight rubber smell, not unpleasant. I aerated them for a couple of days under a fan anyway, and the smell was no longer noticeable once in the cover.

If you didn't know all 4 major brands are from the same factory, memory foam and other inferior forms of foam are hot and leave you sleeping in a hole on one of these mattresses after as little as a month. I am 125 lbs and 5'7, partner is 5'11,150 lbs, we already had indentations in our mattress after 1 month. I read up on the whole pillow top mattress scam and how memory foam is really crap, how people went though multiple Beautyrest  blacks, and Tempurpedics only to find out each one failed in the same way. Extreme sagging. Well, I did my research and now I have this on top of my one month old Beautyrest and it is a godsend. You will never sleep on what feels like hot sand again, like on memory foam, the latex is so soft and it's not toxic like memory foam.(I got the  2' soft).This is dunlop not talalay and I assure you talalay is NOT softer than dunlop, This topper is Firmness rating 20 ILD (soft). I find it plush, perfect for a top layer. I would use a firmer rating for the second and third layers as they do when they make pure latex mattress. What I am trying to say is if Zen Heaven or whomever is trying to tell you talalay is so much better than dunlop they are lying, they are just trying to charge you more money. This product is perfect, I just wish I had known about it before I bought an expensive innerspring. If your innerspring is really in bad shape you can even flip it over and throw one of these toppers on it, I hear it works like a charm. Stay away from memory foam, it really is crap. So hopefully I have saved my 1 month old Beautyrest silver from what others have gone though, and added a few years to it, because the way it was going it was bound for the dumpster in 6 months max. it's very comfortable now with this plush latex layer that is not hot on top of the Beautyrest crap pillow top that slept so hot I woke up sweating multiple Xs a night, plus is as softer than my Beautyrest rated a 7 for super softness and NO SAGGING. I recommend a firmer 3 inch if you have a more serious sagging problem than I did, but if you buy this you will not be sorry and it will outlast your mattress. I will report back in 3 months and let you know how it's holding up.Edit: I flipped over the Beautyrest innerspring because it already had such sagging on the pillowtop I wanted to rip off after just a month of buying it, it was too much. It continued to sag under the topper, so I took the plunge, flipped it, and now there is zero sagging and a 2” plush latex on top under my sheet, with the protector on the mattress because the latex sleeps so cool, I love it! I sleep like the dead and have no pain or ever wake up sweating, same with my husband who use to sweat puddles on memory foam. I saved a ton of money and my sheets still fit, I have always bought king for my queen.  So, don’t hesitate on a sagging pillowtop innersping and wake in pain. Flip it and add a few inches of latex, support AND plush comfort or firm support W/E, choose the one or layers that fit your needs. When this gives out this company has my lifelong business, I hear they make a great mattress and if I had more cash I would have bought one already, but this is working so perfectly so I have zero reason to spend more money. Couldn’t be happier.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Bear with me on my review, I wanted to try to give the best all around opinion.I'm one of those people that have spent thousands of dollars on mattresses and toppers, trying to find some combination that works for comfort and pain relief. I have back issues and joint pain, to generalize my medical history. Not to mention, I'm getting old, which sucks. Suffice it to say, pain is constant with me.Then I tried this latex topper! Wow!I've tried all the different kinds of memory foam toppers out there and pretty much hated every single one. I don't like the 'sink in'  or 'sleeping in a cloud' thing. Yes, it seems somewhat comfortable. For about an hour.Then it's hard to move and makes my back hurt worse because of no support. Also, memory foam is hot too, and I hate to sweat while I'm sleeping. Uggh, gross!I've tried many of them. From cheap to expensive. Even every kind of thickness, none of them seemed to work, spending a small fortune.  I hate them. I ended up giving them away or tossed them in the trash. Such a waste of money.Now, this latex topper is a total game changer!  It's not anything like a memory foam, which after my rant, is a huge plus!It's comfort, softness AND support. I'm a skeptical person, could even call me cynical.  But the fact remained, I needed something to add to my mattress to relieve the pressure points. I'm a side sleeper mostly, occasionally sleeping on my back.This latex topper helped out sooo much! No more shoulder or hip pain, even easing some of my back pain. Wow!! Im amazed at it, really. All from 2 inches of latex.Mattresses are so different, as are people. So many different types and in every price range. Mattresses, not people.Higher prices don't make them better though. Neither do trends.So, I aimed for the decent inexpensive mattresses instead, settling on a lightweight innerspring poly foam one. It's actually more comfortable than the one I spent 2200 bucks on a few years ago. I tried an 10 inch all memory foam one too, and hated it. Gave that away.Now, my mattress shouldn't be that comfortable, right? It's not expensive or anything fancy to brag about, but it is the best mattress I've slept on. I can't sleep on firm beds, causes way too much pain. I need something soft but supporting my spine.But, if it's comfortable, why get a topper? Because I still needed something soft to help out with the lingering hip and shoulder pain. To add that extra layer of  softness and luxury that a good mattress should beg for. Beckoning to be crawled into at night.This 2 inch soft latex topper did that. It worked great at relieving the pain but supporting me thru the night. Allowing me to move around freely and wake up in way less pain. Together, it makes my bed super comfy now!! I look forward to going to sleep, knowing I'm going to wake up in less pain.My mattress is fine now, it's not sagging or in bad shape. Nor is it super thick. Only 10 inches, without the topper. I have no need to hack away at it, or flip it over or hope the topper 'fills in the gaps' from holes left by bodies constantly sleeping in the same spot. If my mattress was in totally bad shape, I'd just replace it. The topper is great but it's not that magical to fix a worn out saggy bad mattress.Honestly, I've already spent enough money on previous mattresses, just trying to find a comfortable one.  But the cost of the one I have now, was very affordable. At that logic, I could replace it regularly and still spend less than one I bought 8 years ago.They say it's recommended to get a new mattress every 7 years.7 years is the magic number for a lot of things, actually. Matresses, cars, houses, jobs, even spouses.I would recommend this topper to anyone and everyone!!The latex is not squishy-soft, in-a-cloud-like-marshmellows soft,  but more subtle, cushiony, supportive, almost bouncy softness.It does not sag, losing it's shape after laying on it for hours, but provides the support to keep you aligned. It does not need to 'bounce back' like memory foam because it does not squish down or form indents from your body shape that has to 'fluff' back up after hours, if it ever does.It did not have a smell to it, nor did I find the need to expose it to the elements either. Sunlight is great, but it can affect things differently. I found no instructions to put it outside, or to air it out. I simply unpacked it, put it on my mattress and let it be. Even with the door closed to my room, after several hours, there was no smell. Definitely no offensive smells like all the memory foam I've had in the past.It's just an all around totally awesome topper.You can bet the house, that if this one ever needs to be replaced, I won't hesitate to purchase another one. The company that makes them is great. Super helpful if you have questions. Delivery was quick.All in all, I'm happy with everything and hope this helps others who want to try this latex topper.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I started out trying to fix the problem with a 2” soft Sleep on Latex topper. I’ve had a latex pillow before, but to have it under your whole body is different, like sleeping on cake. It’s cushioning yet supportive, it rebounds quickly so there’s no sinking feeling like memory foam, it doesn’t retain heat, it’s soft enough to relieve pressure, but buoyant enough to actively support concave curves in your body.We realized after a couple of weeks that 2” wasn’t quite enough, as we could still feel the firmness of the new mattress beneath it. We are both lightweight side sleepers (5’7 115lbs & 5’9 140lbs) so it’s easy for mattresses to feel too firm for us — in hindsight I should’ve gotten a 3”, but it’s fine, it kicked off our latex journey :)Weeks of research lead me to believe that Talalay processed latex might be the next best thing to get to stack on top of the Sleep on Latex topper. Sleep on Latex doesn’t make Talalay toppers, just Dunlop, so I had to get one from another company.Note on Talalay vs Dunlop: The best comparison I’ve found is Talalay = angel food cake & Dunlop = pound cake. As the owner of both, the difference isn’t big enough to fret over, IMHO. Talalay is more expensive due to the slightly more complex process, and is a little bouncier/more responsive as a pressure relief layer as a result of having more air bubbles in it, while Dunlop is exceedingly supportive because of its density. Both outclass all other topper materials when it comes to durability, longevity, support, pressure relief, eco-friendliness, value, and utter lack of heat retention, among other things.Anyway, the combination of the 3” Talalay + 2” Dunlop made our bed feel like a big marshmallow. It was amazing. However, I was waking up really sore in my hips from them partially dislocating in my sleep (I have the connective tissue disorder EDS), and ultimately found that the soft & fancy mattress at the bottom was failing to provide sufficient support.I went looking for a less-expensive, still-nice mattress with reputable pocketed coils to use as our base/support layer. The best one we found that met our requirements was literally one fifth of the price of the other mattress (which has since been returned), and the firmness of it unexpectedly & perfectly compliments the latex’s softness, providing the support that a very soft mattress could not, but it still felt ever so slightly too firm.I reached out to Sleep on Latex again with about 100 questions. Among many very helpful insights, they suggested folding our 2” in half under the Talalay to see if that felt better. It absolutely did, so I ordered another 2” soft (practically giddy to feed my newfound addiction to latex bedding, lol).We are (finally) sleeping more comfortably than we have in literal years on top of a whopping 7” of latex on top of an inexpensive-yet-reputable firm 8” pocketed coil mattress.Note on layering: if you’re going all-in on latex like we did but still want the bounce & breathability of coils, make sure the mattress at the bottom is on the firm side (or if you can afford a no-return policy, just get straight pocketed coils for a full DIY mattress). **You can always make a firm bed softer, but you can never firm up a soft bed — plush mattresses are literally just the firm equivalent of that mattress with additional foam on top.** I’d personally much rather be able to control the type and feel of the comfort layer(s) than have it permanently stitched onto a bed that might not work for me. And because it’s modular, single layers can be replaced as needed rather than having to get rid of the whole thing, so it’s more eco-conscious and will last longer. When I figured this out, it felt like I’d cracked the code/cheated the system. Worth it.Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Sleep on Latex also sells the BEST cotton stretch topper covers on the market. It’s really worth getting one if you want your latex topper to last as long as possible. If you order directly from their website, they’re available in every increment from 1”-12”, so one could contain a whole DIY mattress inside a single cover. The top and bottom unzip so the top half can be machine washed, it’s surprisingly easy to put on, makes it way easier to move the latex around without risking a rip, the cotton twill bottom does not slip around (even with our adjustable bed base), and it doesn’t change the feel of the latex at ALL. Per the reps at SoL, it is not designed to protect the topper form liquid, so if you need something waterproof, invest in a TPU mattress protector. It will change the texture of the latex a little, which shouldn’t be bothersome unless you’re super texturally-sensitive (if you are, but still need a waterproof protector, it feels less weird to layer it underneath the cotton stretch cover).Enjoy totally changing the way you sleep for the better :)",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

So I ordered a replacement (it's $85 + tax for 2"" king) and mentioned in my order that this was to replace a cover where the zipper had come off. Within 30m, I got an email from CS, reversing the charges and sending out via 2 day fedex that same morning a replacement for free because they said that the zipper shouldn't have come off and that it's not fair to have the customer pay for something that wasn't their fault. I was really impressed they did that without me even asking. Furthermore, the replacement cover is better than the one that came pre-attached when I ordered on Amazon: the zipper, on both the top and bottom parts, is a totally normal zipper, like what's at the bottom of your jacket. The original cover I can't really describe how the zipper tracks worked, but they were confusing and were easier to accidentally have the zipper come off. Well, maybe if you're a luddite like me that struggles even with putting on a duvet cover.5 stars for comfort (2"" king size soft model). I'm a side sleeper and normally my hip gets sore when I sleep. I've used this for a few weeks now: not a single mote of pain. Same for sleeping on my back. So it gets perfect marks for sleep quality. Furthermore, I did not notice ANY latex scent like some people here seem to claim. Maybe it's because I bought it with the cover already attached? Regardless, at one point I spilled red wine on the cover so I figured I'd wash it. Big mistake. While yes, you can wash it, the zipper easily came off and I spent literally 4 hours trying to figure out how to just simply reattach it. Total waste. So now I have to separately order a replacement cotton topper ($85), wait for that to arrive, then attempt to attach it. You can't buy the cotton topper alone on Amazon: you can only separately buy it direct from the manufacturer, FYI.So tl;dr - 5 stars for everything but cleaning. The zipper is way too easy to accidentally come off and then it becomes impossible as far as I can tell to reattach it. So 1 star for that. But it's still functional, doesn't smell, fixes all my sleep discomfort issues, so I'll just deduct 1 star from the original 5 star review.FYI - If you get a really bad stain like I did, a good way to clean it safely is:1. Use either coarse kosher salt or baking soda and take a toothbrush and scrub a good amount on BOTH sides of the stain2. after that's done, dump the salt, and then pour on some more salt/soda directly on the stain and let it sit for (YMMV) at least an hour, enough time to soak up as much as it can.3. Dump the salt/soda4. Take a toothbrush, and mix a small dab of dish detergent (for hand washing, not your dishwasher), and the hottest water you got.5. Scrub until your arm is sore BOTH sides, using circular motions as well as back/forth6. Use the hottest water you got in your shower to rinse that off7. Take hydrogen peroxide - it's safe (it's actually the main ingredient in bleach-less ""bleach"" aka color safe and safe for clothing in general) and pour it all over the stain. Repeat the same Cinderella-style tasks of scrubbing til your arm hurts with another toothbrush.8. By now you should definitely be seeing an improvement. When you think it's pretty good, like not anywhere near as much left, once again rinse it all off with your hottest shower water9. Soak the stained part in white vinegar (safe for cleaning pretty much anything) if you have a particularly tough stain like I did, for a few hours.10. Rinse with hot water.11. The stain should be gone, or if not, nearly gone.12. Wash it in your machine: if you have a HE model, pour about 1/4 cup of white vinegar into the fabric softener tray (yes, fabric softener) and just for good measure another 1/4 cup directly into the bottom of the drum and then toss the cover in the machine.13. Wash on warm - I couldn't find a garment tag so I don't know what the hottest it can take is, but I chose the lowest temp above cold14. If, like me, you're super paranoid, when done do another wash cycle but this time use the ""color safe bleach"" aka plain old hydrogen peroxide: add that to the normal bleach area and, at least with the Clorox brand I got, it said to also add some directly to the HE soap container.15. Both times I washed it, I also did a prewash with a small amount of standard detergent, and both times I did extra rinses to be sure everything was washed away.16. Again, couldn't find a garment tag, but given it's pre-shrunk, I dried it at the lowest temperature (I have a super low setting, even lower than ""low"" and just above ""air dry"" on my LG) for an hour and it was all dried and cleaned.17. BE CAREFUL OF THE ZIPPER - MINE EASILY FELL OFF, probably due to negligence (I have a hard time putting duvet covers on as well as doing stuff like this).",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

While it feels good to lay on it at first, it gets miserable after a while as it does traps body heat even though it has a gel in it 🥵 and makes it difficult to change the position since it has a slow response. I do have an expensive good quality mattress, I just wanted to add a layer of comfort. I love this topper!!! It's soft, and yet, it supports you unlike memory foam.  Aging sucks! Every part of my body is very thankful for how this topper makes them feel better. I will never return to a memory foam, gel or no gel. Delivery was fast. As far as smell: I have a very sensitive nose. If I would have to rate it on a scale 1-10(10 is the worst) I would give it a 3. It didn't bother me much.  I did put a luxurious mattress pad over it and I can't smell it. We bought 2 inch king size ( soft). I will definitely buy from this company again. I am 47 year old female that unpacked the package and put it on the bed by myself  without any help. I did it carefully by folding it and unfolding it. It's not too heavy. Anyway,  thank you so much for a great product.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This mattress topper is the answer! I spent hours reading reviews and (after a few regrets and returns with other brands), I committed to the 3” queen foam topper and it’s perfect! I finally have the soft cozy bed of my dreams with less joint pain, and I didn’t have to buy a whole new bed frame and mattress. This brand seems to focus less on marketing gimmicks and more on just producing a quality, affordable topper. I can’t speak to the longevity since I’m only about a week in, but every other box is checked.

I weight about 250 lbs. and was thinking the soft might be too soft so I called the company and a customer service rep said the soft is not really too soft so I ordered the 3"" soft.It arrived and it did not have any kind of an odor that I could detect.  Slept on it that night and it was perfect.....just the right amount of softness.  I think the medium would have been too firm so I would recommend the soft to side sleepers unless your mattress is really sagging then maybe the medium or the firm.

My memory foam was not very old, but it was SO HOT, like wake up sweating buckets in the middle of winter hot, and the nature of sinking into it made me constantly sink into my husband's valley, thus giving me a horrible back ache. I was not waking up rested at all, and something needed to give.We needed something to cushion our less than a year old futon mattress, as it is so hard and stiff that it makes my arms fall asleep and gives hip pain. A new mattress was out. Can't afford one, and don't want anything else memory foam Ever. Again.I tried a feather bed, which was glorious for all of 2 months, until it developed a permanent ""dent"" where our rear ends rested nightly. And this happened despite my daily fluffing to redistribute feathers. So feather beds were out, too!So I looked at other natural alternatives. Latex is something I have been interested in for years, but it is so expensive! We decided a good night's sleep was worth the cost, plus this company had a good return policy.This latex topper took a little getting used to, since we have been on memory foam on and off for years. I loved it immediately. You don't sink in, so you don't feel trapped, and it does not sleep hot at all!It took my husband a few weeks before he could say he really likes it.I do not bottom out on this, but my husband does, so he still feels the mattress underneath around his hip area. For reference, we got the soft topper in 3 inches. I vary from 110lbs to 115lbs. My husband is around 140lbs. He still feels we need another 3 inch topper in medium to go under the soft for him to be 100% comfy.Also for reference, my husband is a 100% side sleeper, and I switch from side to back about 50/50.So if you are heavier than 130lbs and sleep exclusively on your side, you may want to go with a medium firmness, or put a soft on top of a medium if you have an unbearably hard bed like we do.This latex topper gives nice ""bounce"" for amorous activities. You don't get the annoying sinkage like with memory foam, so that is a nice plus!I definitely recommend this latex topper for anyone who doesn't want the hot mess and chemicals of memory foam, or the maintenance of feather beds, but who wants to soften up their current bed.A couple things I noticed:1) It does have an odor. It isn't terrible, but the smell clings to my sheets. It doesn't give me a headache, and I don't notice it anymore unless changing out sheets.  So I do feel the smell is natural, since it doesn't make me feel ill like memory foam smells do. Some reviewers say it smells like vanilla pudding. Not sure what type of pudding they eat... but it definitely doesn't smell like any kind of pudding I have ever had, vanilla or otherwise!I don't know if a cover would diminish or eliminate the smell. Haven't tried one.2) This will take on the shape of the mattress or surface you put it on. If your current mattress has sizeable divots in it, this topper will mold to those.3) To get the most benefit from the softness and bounciness of this topper, do NOT make your bed super tight. For example:  I like my bottom sheet to be nice and tightly stretched onto the bed, complete with hospital corners (on my side, anyway, as my husband hates his side of the top sheet tucked in.) You can't do this with this topper. I noticed tight bottom sheets equal a firm, stiff topper that doesn't have any softness or bounce, and my arms go numb when laying on my side. Make your bottom sheet fit loosely, and don't compress the topper, and it will work as it should.4) Cats don't like the feel of this topper on their paws when you have stripped the bed and are remaking it. Seriously. They act like they have tape on their paws or have stepped in water. Just sayin'.I would buy this again in a heartbeat! We are talking about getting 2 more 3 inch toppers in medium firmness to make our own mattress, as this is what other latex mattress companies do to make their soft mattresses: 3"" soft, 3"" medium, 3"" medium. Sleep on Latex offers a custom cover if you want to stack your covers, so that's what we will be doing in the next year or so.Happy Sleeping!!**I purchased this with my own money and have received absolutely NO compensation for my review.

Let me start off by saying I don't write of lot of reviews but I felt the need to write this review so that someone that might be in my predicament might have an honest review to go off of when purchasing this mattress topper. 2 weeks ago I bought a mattress off of Amazon that happened to be  great as far as hitting all the pressure points that I was suffering from. I slept good but I did realize after a few days that it was too firm for me. The mattress stopped all the body pain except my shoulders were killing me which made me realize this mattress was not for side sleepers even though it was advertised as such. The rest of my body wasn't hurting anymore but I was waking up stiff which is how I realized the mattress was just too firm. They company refunded me $100 to buy a mattress topper which I did a 3 inch gel memory foam. That i bought because of the so called cooling affect of the gel. That didn't work I wrote another review on that. It was off my bed the 2nd night.Anyway back to Amazon to the 1st one I was researching in the 1st place and decided to finally purchase. Which is this 2 inch latex queen topper. Oh my goodness what a difference where have you been all my life? All the beds I've thrown or given away from being to soft or too hard or gotten too lumpy this mattress topper could have saved me a lot of money.I am a 58 yr. old female 265lbs. All my weight is waist up. My bones are getting weak which is why I bought the ""medium firm mattress"" in the 1st place. With this latex mattress topper I am on top of it when I lay on it. I do not sink into like memory foam. It provides just the right amount of cushion needed to relieve the firmness from my mattress but I'm still supported. If you have a mattress that's starting to get lumpy or too soft or too hard buy it. You will not regret it. As far as sleeping hot I don't any more than usual. I have hot flashes and I suffer from insomnia. This is not a magic carpet if you suffer from insomnia this will not stop that as insomnia is mental, but if you toss and turn because of a bad mattress that makes you uncomfortable than this is it. My shoulders don't hurt anymore.This is an honest review I was not paid for it. Sorry it was so long but hope it helped. Oh I almost forgot there was no smell that I noticed. I unpacked it on top of my mattress. When i squeezed it Ithought I made a mistake because it felt soft and squishy I continued anyway. I had to pull it up a little which was a little hard to do but not impossible I was glad I didn't tear it. I was already 2 inches so i didn't have to wait until it expanded which i was happy about. It also hangs about an inch and a half on each side. So it's a little too big. I didn't buy the cover instead I put my mattress pad on it to protect it which does the job. The over hang doesn't bother me but it might bother some. Once I put on the mattress pad and my sheet on it smashed it to where I don't really noticed. I'm comfortable now in bed which is more important to me. I highly recommend.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's perfect for people who at leasts partially sleep on their sides at night.If you have a very curvy figure I recommend stacking two 3"" toppers on top of each other - works amazingly well.  You could even use two such toppers instead of a mattress.This topper is also not hot in summer, surprisingly.I've never slept as well.

We have an 8 yr old mattress that must have started sagging, I started getting back problems and it was the mattress not me. So I researched this topper. Ah it really is like a spongey angel food cake. For a 130 lb side sleeper with similar weight husband this is great for the both of us. You can’t feel the original mattress at all and my back is now in alignment. It’s such a relief for much cheaper than a new mattress. When we first got it I thought it had a faint scent of peanut butter or almonds. I don’t notice anything now. My existing mattress cover works fine over it. Really love how plush and comfy it is. It’s plenty thick. I looked from the side and we barely compress that much into it, so it’s got great support. I only wish the corners were rounded. But fits right on a queen if you get the queen size. I’m enjoying a peaceful sleep.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

We found the 8.5"" thick mattress right on the edge of being thick enough, so adding another 3 inches with the topper makes a difference.  You can then adjust the overall softness by having the topper on top (which is the normal way of using the topper), or putting it at the bottom if you want the firmer feel of medium on top, but getting the same 11.5 overall thickness either way.  This is probably a very personal thing, but it seems that many mattress manufacturers that use a combination of foams and springs use this formula of medium/firm for the lower layers which form the majority of the thickness, and soft for the very top layer.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

The last week of sleeping has been like heaven!My lower back had some issues 3 years ago and lots of internet research lead me to purchase a full latex mattress at that time. We purchased a firm latex base foam with I think a 3-inch medium latex topper......all contained in the original mattress. Something was just not right. Over time my shoulder began to hurt sometimes in the morning. Once I finally said something to my significant other she let me know how uncomfortable she has been sleeping on our current latex mattress. So we began a new search for something else. I actually found this topper first and ordered it on Amazon.Before the topper arrived we stopped into a local mattress store. We really liked the soft hybrid (springs on the bottom and memory foam on top) feel but felt it ""enveloped"" us a bit too much and the salesperson felt it might not offer the support we needed. The medium hybrid seemed just a bit too firm and I could not get my shoulder to sink in enough to make it more comfortable when I slept on my side. We also tried their Dream Lux mattress and liked the support and higher quality feel of that foam topping versus any of the hybrid memory foam products. The sales person was good at his job and convinced us to pull the trigger on the medium hybrid mattress.We got home that night and Amazon had delivered our Pure Green topper. The box was sitting at our front door. The decision was to return it to save that money since we had just spent over $ 6k at the mattress store (we also bought an electric moveable bed platform that raised the feet and head). We decided to open the package anyway and potentially ""waste"" the $ 250 just to try the Pure Green topper.We were stunned. This latex was so much softer then what we had in the mattress we had placed it on. Once we got a mattress pad and sheets on it we were heaven. We literally did not want to get out of bed. Not only did I feel so good when I was resting on my back but I felt the perfect amount of shoulder give and take when sleeping on my side. Better yet we still felt the support from our mattress underneath. We also felt the overall quality and supporting feel this latex foam topper had that for whatever reason any of the mattress stores memory foam mattresses did not have. It is hard to explain but to both of us felt that the memory foam beds had too much give and were kind of cheap in feel. We canceled the mattress store purchase and saved $ 4k of our $ 6k purchase.So one week later and we are still in heaven. I have not slept this good in years. In fact, I think the last time I felt this good sleeping on a mattress was when we purchased a traditional box spring with a large topper built into the mattress.  So what would I recommend to anyone?....* If I had to do it over again and wanted to buy a new mattress I would for sure purchase a latex mattress. I would make the lower portion of the mattress medium and make sure at least 3-4 inches of the top portion was soft.* If you do not want to do the above and feel your current mattress has any sort of support then I would purchase this Pure Green 100% Natural Latex Mattress Topper. We went with the 2 inch option and it is a perfect combination of soft with support. I would assume the 3 inch option would be as good if not even softer but we purchased the 2 inch and it is AWESOME! Also make sure you get a really nice and comfortable topper that secures nicely around the bottom of the bed. It holds it all in place.* Mattress Stores? My best friend had just purchased a soft hybrid a month ago and they love it. They spent $ 5k on everything and to be honest cost should never be the main driver when purchasing a bed. You do spend a third of your life sleeping and your bodies comfort and health should be priority # 1. If you go to a mattress store and really like the memory foam options then go for it. For me/us we love the latex mattress options instead and this Pure Green mattress topper is simply unreal. I also feel that long-term​ the memory foam will form permanent sags in the mattress where this latex foam topper goes right back into place the second we move off of it.FYI we also like the electric base we purchased and decided to have that delivered and keep it. The ability to press the remote and raise our heads and feet to read before bed is really nice. I am also trying to slightly raise the feet at night to see if I can go back to sleeping strictly on my back (which is supposed to be better for you). So far no luck with that and I always end up turning on one of my sides.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Meulen,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","I am a side sleeper and I use to be really large in size. I would always buy super firm mattresses because of my size and my back having issues. I never had hip and shoulder pain. However, as I've lost a considerable amount of weight and I started having hip and shoulder pain. Turns out, because I'm a side sleeper I need a much softer mattress. In other words I lost some of my own personal cushion and as such I need to add some cushion elsewhere to alleviate my pain. My mattress isn't that old and I am not willing to shell out a lot of money for a new high quality mattress just yet. So I thought the next best thing would be a topper.I already use latex pillows so I decided to try a latex topper. I figured it would be the best for me as I sleep hot and I'm worried about a memory foam topper retaining too much heat, especially since I live in Florida where it feels like hades itself opened up in the center of the state.The mattress topper came in really well wrapped and boxed. However, I wish they would use a biodegradable wrapping as opposed to the plastic they use. They make plant based wrapping that would do the same thing for them and be more healthy for our environment but enough about that. Once I unwrapped it from it's cannoli shape and removed it from the second inner wrapping of plastic (really?) I positioned it on the bed to let it air out and regain it's proper shape. The off gassing was very minimal. Those who report horrible off gassing, I'm not sure what you're witnessing because mine had very little. The mattress topper was slightly longer in length than my queen size mattress (less than a 1/2 inch). Also, the mattress topper has sharp corners unlike my mattress which has rounded ones. This is all fine and good.I let the mattress off gas for several hours and then made the bed putting the mattress pad over the topper and then of course bed linens. The first night I slept on it I over slept! I NEVER over sleep and I am usually awake before my alarm. I must have been sleeping so well I turned the alarm off and went back to sleep. I didn't wake until I got a call from my boss wondering where I was as I'm never late for work without calling.First thing I noticed, besides that I overslept that morning, was the pain in my shoulders and hips were not present! So it appears I have found the solution to needing to buy a new mattress and alleviating the pain in my shoulders and hips.I did not opt for the model with the cover since I was going to put a mattress protector over it.Pros: Pain is gone, very comfy, very little to no off gassing.Cons: May over sleep because you're so comfortable.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Allen,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2021","I bought a 3"" thick, Soft, Queen-sized topper from this company (Pure Green). The topper arrived very quickly (earlier than expected), undamaged, in a smaller package than expected. The topper was very compressed and nearly vacuum sealed. It was a little clumsy to open up and unroll but no problems were encountered. I let it expand and ""breathe"" overnight before using it (it's rather heavy and very ""bouncy"" - challenging to move around when unpacked and unrolled). Yes, there was a distinct ""rubber"" smell (it reminded me of balloons). The next day, the smell seemed to be less than before. The quality of the latex is pretty good. On the end and bottom, there were some minor deformities (caused by air bubbles). None of these was bad enough for me to worry about. The material seemed sturdy and highly stretchy. I was honestly worried it would be too soft for my 285 lb. weight.When I flipped it over and inspected the top side, it was free of any imperfections. The ""ventilation holes"" (spread around 1 - 2"" apart) were symmetrical and deep. They also went right up the the edges of the topper. I was pleased with the construction - it seemed to be of high quality.When I bought this product, Pure Green recommended an affordable, breathable cover to also buy, so I bought it. I had always intended to cover it anyway. The topper cover was excellent and fairly easy to put on. A zipper runs all the way around the seem of it. The end of the zipper got unzipped when I was preparing to put the topper in it  and it was a little tricky to rezip it once the topper was placed on/in it... but it wasn't too bad - manageable by only one person). The cover dramatically muted the rubber smell and was very soft to the touch.Once I got the covered topper on my Queen-sized mattress (which is only about 7 months old - it's a firm, spring mattress), it matched my mattress size almost exactly. It was easy to move into position. I covered both of these with a new mattress cover (that was recommended when I bought the topper and it's cover). The mattress cover fit perfectly over both and further reduced any rubber smells. After weeks of use, I'm pleased to report that the topper and cover remained in place and didn't shift at all in the night.Being a 58-yr. old, big guy with broad shoulders (I used to be an athlete and weight-lifter), my new firm mattress was wrecking me each and every night. I often woke with back and hip pain in the morning, which took it's toll on my during the day. Since I've used this topper, I had no hip or back pain whatsoever. This topper actually wasn't too soft at all - it complimented my firm mattress perfectly. I never got hot in the night; I never sank in too far and pretty much all of my body felt supported and comfortable. I usually sleep on my side and sometimes my stomach - no problems and no more pain in the morning. Bliss! My 130 lb., 60+ yr. old wife laid on the mattress (I sleep alone on it) and she said she felt very comfortable on it too.I believe this product has a 10-yr. warranty. It has exceeded my expectations and caused me to sleep so much better than before. I'm extremely pleased and highly recommend it.P.S. There is no longer any hint of rubber smell at all, whatsoever. Double bliss!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

First of all, please know that I review almost every item I buy - whether it be from Amazon or not. I am an older woman and I remember the days when you went into a store and the people working there actually knew their products and could help you decide what you might need (or not need) by giving you valuable information. Well, welcome to 2020 where I have learned to be discerning and to rely on my own research and read what other people have written in their reviews of products. But every once in awhile I find a company that has that has the trifecta...a wonderful product, really good customer service AND knowledgeable employees who readily share that knowledge with the consumer. SleepOnLatex is one such company.  I decided on a mattress topper, because my mattress (from that company we ALL know, based in the Netherlands) was in good shape and nice and firm. The problem was there was this ripple in it that I could not get out and it drove me crazy. As a lot of people, I naturally thought of getting a memory foam topper until I started reading about natural latex and that's how I found the Pure Green 100% Natural Latex Mattress Topper on Amazon. Not only were the reviews spectacular, but I learned a lot about natural latex - where it is found in the world, how it is harvested and how it is cured to come to the state you find it in a mattress or mattress topper. Admittedly, this might be way too much information for most people, but I just wanted to let you know that I did read a lot and it was interesting. Okay, back to the company and the mattress topper-----after realizing that I wanted this product, I took my weight, firmness preference and how high I wanted the topper (1"", 2"" or 3"") into consideration and I purchased a 2-inch medium/firm queen mattress topper. I put it on my bed, covered the mattress topper with a new mattress pad and then my sheets and couldn't wait to try it that night. it was okay, but I could tell it was lacking something in the comfort department, because it was too firm.  I placed to call to customer service at SleepOnLatex and I spoke with and awesome gentleman, Joe, who asked me some questions and after a couple of minutes we decided that I would probably be happiest with the 3"" soft topper.  Knowing that there is no way anybody could get an unrolled mattress topper back in the box it originally came in, he sent me a larger box to return the initial 2"" topper I had gotten.  I went back on Amazon, initiated that return and purchased the 3"", soft queen.  It arrived in a few days and I was soooo excited to try it out, but I waited until that night. Oh my goddess! It is perfection!  I'm never leaving my bed!  LOL.1. Read about the advantages of NATURAL latex. It's super interesting.2. Check out the SleepOnLatex company. Read their story - a business combining  humanity and sustainability3. I thought I knew what was best for me, but didn't. Make a quick call to the company and let them help you decide.4. This mattress topper, by its construction, has holes all through it. I'm almost 70 and it was easy to maneuver onto my bed and position it, BUT don't grab a small spot and pull the topper. Instead, I found it's much easier (and safer for the topper) to hold an area of an edge and kind of lift it and shift the position as it's slightly off your mattress. This avoids the latex topper from ""catching"" the mattress fabric.5. ENJOY!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The bed was high, and although he's a tall man, he lost strength in his left arm and leg.  He slid out several times, crushing the side support and stretching the outer material encasing everything.  The inner support foam was distorted, stretched out of shape.  As a result, you felt like you were falling out of bed on that side.  Fortunately, these beds can be rebuilt.I replaced the side bolsters, but it's imperative that the pillow top enclosure stays tight, because it holds everything together.  I used strong buttonhole thread to stitch along the bottom, taking up the 2 1/2"" that the covering had stretched.  Now the side is held straight again without bowing and tilting.I still needed to replace the foam for the top of the air chambers.  The air chambers in this mattress, which is about 10 years old, are 1"" below the top of the foam sides.  We have a queen sized bed.I decided to change the type of foam used in the support layers.  The foam they used was memory foam, which have a tendency to dip after a while, because the foam doesn't recover quickly. It gets misshapened.  I'm using 1"",  high density foam,  and 3"" thick medium firm latex on top. Because of their quick recovery, these will keep the bed top even, so the dreaded ""dip"" doesn't form.I ordered the FULL size high density foam to top the chambers.  I had to cut ~ 2"" off the bottom to fit inside the sides.  The foam fit perfectly.  It's proving to be the perfect type of foam to form the inner support layer.I replaced the 3"" queen sized memory foam with this 3"" latex topper.  The latex topper is placed over everything, edge to edge, and zippered in.The bed is like brand new.  I've since replaced the bed frame so it's lower for my husband.If you have a sleep number bed that's sagging, what I've done is the solution.  The total cost, including new sides, was less than $400.  If you had to order everything from a bed repair site, the cost would have been close to $800 (not including a new zippered outer covering).  The cost of OEM parts are outrageous.I still have full adjustability, but the new foam layers recover immediately, keeping the bed level and comfortable.  I'm glad I used latex instead of memory foam.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This has given me zero doubt that I will be purchasing there mattress soon. If you are questioning anything call them first like I did.  They will answer and if you're package is damaged or something isn't right they will go above and beyond for you and there products reputation to make it right.  This is something we do not get to much of anymore these days. I have literally 3 people who have tried it out and are going to buy them.  It's just perfect.  Again everybody is different and has unique desires and needs so I'm not saying this is a one topper fits all, but I have personally tried pretty much everything.. too the point of landing on a latex topper lol not because I knew our ever heard about them.  I never knew this type of mattress or topper existed either only because of my sad need for a good night's sleep I always went with the 50k plus 4.9 star online review stuff and it always let me down.  I hope anyone reading this does pull the trigger and has my personal experience.  Good luck and god bless!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I did a LOT to research to find a mattress topper that was natural, non-toxic, doesn’t make you sweat a bunch, isn’t too thick, isn’t too pillowy, etc.The king mattress we received from our landlord (we moved in to a fully furnished home) was brand new but pretty hard. My partner and I wake up with numb limbs and toss & turn most of the night. We finally said “enough” and I dove down the mattress-topper-research rabbit hole. It’s overwhelming in there…I don’t recommend it.I finally settled in this bad boy after hours of searching and comparing (and digging into the company to see if they’re greenwashing or actually legit). It checked all the boxes, and here we are. Laying on my “new” bed, more comfortable than I’ve been in months! Not sweaty! Not too soft! Doesn’t smell like chemicals (there is a natural latex scent but it goes away), and it inflated rather easily/quickly.If you’re looking for something durable, affordable, natural, and not too soft but not too firm, you’re in the right spot. Highly recommend!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's soft, comfortable, and very cool to sleep on — I used it on top of my organic Avocado mattress to add some additional cushion instead of opting for the sewn-in pillow top. It sort of feels like sleeping on a fresh (non-stale) marshmallow or fluffy cheesecake LOL... not sure how else to describe it. It definitely has bounce/springiness to it (does NOT feel at all like memory foam — it's a way better experience than that).But, personally, I think it might be just a bit too soft for me. I have lower back pain/arthritis, and while this is a comfortable topper to lay on, sometimes the softness can cause a bit too much sinking in and/or make it difficult to get up in the morning (in an ow my lower back hurts way). But, then again, sometimes this isn't the case, either. For reference, I'm 6' tall and weight 220lbs, so for smaller humans it may work well, as you wouldn't sink in as much. Really it depends on you, your body, and your preferences.I think for anyone looking for a soft, 100% natural mattress topper, this is a fantastic and affordable option — but maybe consider the 2"" instead of the 3"", depending on the mattress you have underneath. One inch doesn't sound like much of a difference, but it is.It's also worth noting that some people may not enjoy the slight odor of natural latex, but I like it — it smells fresh in a way. And it's WAY better than the smell (and negative health effects) of synthetic foams.One thing to note, though... these 3"" toppers are fairly heavy and difficult to move. To move/store it, I have to fold it in half and roll it up, then wrap a small rope around it several times and tie it to secure it in place. And it does take up quite a bit of storage space if not on the bed, but... well, that's fine. Just something to note.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After just 1 night of sleeping on this, I and my wife's post-sleep aches started to fade. After a few days, gone. Amazing. We didn't experience any of the negatives noted by some purchasers. No off-gassing, no pad movement. Very cool. The pad itself was pretty light and easy to maneuver. Parts of the foam will indeed break off if you pull hard on it, so don't pull on it! What we don't know is whether it will develop depressions, or collapse at the edges from sitting there to put on shoes, etc. But after about 3 weeks, the experience is perfect, and it saved us a lot of $$ to not replace the mattress. BTW, we have a padded pillow-top separate from the mattress (which had become ineffective) that we wrapped around this, so we didn't need a cover.  Best purchase we've made in a while.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After all this time I still have no complaints.I was very worried buying it initially because I didn’t want to have to deal with the hassle of returning by mail a queen mattress topper, but was relieved when we liked it so much after initially trying it.I don’t recall what the delivery experience was like or if the topper had a strong smell initially as it was so long ago, so I can’t speak to that but it has remained just as soft and plush as when we first got it and we use it each and every day.I don’t exactly know how to explain how the topper feels, but I much prefer it to memory foam. I don’t feel like I sink in and get trapped in the bed like I do with memory foam. Also, I haven’t noticed ever feeling overly hot when sleeping on the topper. I feel like it dissipates heat well in the warmer months. I really don’t have any complaints other than the price, but with how long it lasts I suppose that isn’t even an issue.In fact, the reason I’m writing this review is because we’re thinking about upgrading to a king and regardless of which mattress we buy we wanted to get another one of these toppers in king size.In my opinion, you can’t go wrong with this topper (as long as you don’t have a latex allergy). If you’re on the fence about which mattress topper is right for you, I say go with this one.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Almost purchased a topper from tempurpedic at Costco but I am so glad I didn‘t, since it felt much too soft and I could tell it would have that „sinking in“ feeling.  Then I went back to read reviews about SLO toppers and decided to give it a try since I like the customer servie and organic business practices they provide. After talking to their phone customer service staff member  I purchased the 2 inch soft mattress topper and I have to admit I wish I would have done that at the time of my mattress purchase.  My bed is so much more comfortable now and I am SO glad I decided against a „conventional“ topper.  I do think the 3 inch would have been too soft for me and the 1 inch too thin, therefore the 2 inch was perfect to add a level of comfort to a still good mattress in order to modify it to help with shoulder and lower back issues.

Akers,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021","Great Product! For years, we have tried different beds and never succeeded in getting a good comfortable nights sleep.  Recently, due to lack of sleep, took up this project again of finding the ""right bed""; regardless of price.I read many customer reviews on many name brand beds, watched infomercials on Sleep Number vs Perfect Sleeper and researched for hours on hybrid mattress and DIY.  I came to the conclusion that the best reviews were on hybrids that had a firm foundation, medium middle and soft top.  Longest lasting foundation seemed to be a heavy duty innerspring mattress, not microcoil or pocket coil as they feel good in the beginning, but they're weak and give out quickly.The best foam is this Dunlop natural latex so I got a 2"" medium and 2"" soft and used together on the older queen coil (innerspring) mattress in the guest room and we tried it out for a couple months and found it has been a wonderful change and change our sleep (our health).Desiring to move this same configuration to a California King in our room, I went looking for an innerspring mattress with firm heavy gauge coils between 7-9 inches, but wasn't finding that exact match, so went with the LinenSpa 6"" innerspring mattress with heavy duty coils and topped with the Pure Green Natural Latex, one 2"" medium and a 2"" soft and the result was another fantastic sleeping bed for just over $600 in Cal King size!Because the product combination of HD coils and real latex are all the longest lasting materials, we expect lots of great sleep for a long time.  If one of the components seems to fail over time, it's easy to replace just one for a couple hundred and buying all over is still an awesome price!IF a couple has very different preferences in firmness feel, you can cut the toppers in half and mix or layer them differently.  For example, you can put the medium firmness on top on one side and the soft on top of the other side; buy a total zippered mattress cover of 4"" height and arrange the halves inside as you want.  You could also add a firm topper among the choices to use and buy a twin one to cut if only one person wants a very firm mattress on their side.So glad we found this information and hope it's helpful to others.  There's nothing more powerful to your health than a good nights sleep and it's great to wake up without back or hip pain!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Mah,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","After 5 years of sleeping on a very expensive memory foam mattress that was exacerbating my lower back issues, I over corrected and purchased a brand new coil spring, tight top, extra firm Beauty Rest mattress. It felt great lying on it for a few minutes in the store, but turned out to be way too firm for me as I am a side sleeper.Not sure what to expect from latex, I first bought a 1"" firm Sleep On Latex topper. As advertised, the topper provided a slight tweak to the firmness of the mattress, but my arms and shoulders were still falling asleep. Next, I bought a 1"" medium topper to place on top of the firm topper. That also helped, but was still a bit firm. Finally, I removed the the 1"" firm and bought a 2"" soft to place on top of the 1"" medium topper. This was perfect! Except, it slept hot compared to the firm and medium toppers, so I flipped them over and put the 1"" medium over the 2"" soft. I was expecting to be upset at the loss of comfort in doing this, but it has actually worked out very nicely. Now my bed feels like a professional commercial grade bed with plenty of support and a layer of consistent, plush, luxury on top.My husband is a back sleeper and likes a firm mattress. He was happy with the bare mattress and equally happy with all of the different topper combinations, so I think it's fair to say that none of the density levels are overly soft.I put the 1"" firm topper on my guest bed which is a Tuft & Needle mattress that was a bit too soft and it has made a small but noticeable difference.Main observations from someone who has slept on all three firmness levels -1.) The firmness ratings are accurate. If you are a side sleeper, firm will probably be too much for you. Soft is great for relieving pressure points, but it is not too squishy either.2.) These toppers are VERY supportive no matter which density you choose. You will not sink in or bottom out, even on the 1"" topper. For reference, my husband and I are both of average BMI (23-25) and both weigh under 200lbs.3.) As advertised, 1"" = a tweak, 2"" = a very noticeable change, 3"" = a total makeover.4.) The firmness of your base layer makes a huge difference - if you're starting out with a very firm surface, you won't regret buying a ""soft"" topper and if you have a really soft mattress like my Tuft & Needle was, a ""firm"" topper will help a lot.5.) The soft topper does sleep hotter than the firm and medium.When all was said and done, I ended up spending a lot of money to experiment with these toppers, but considering I got a reasonable deal on my mattress and did not buy a fancy one, I still feel like I came out ahead and will have a great bed that should last me a good long time. I am sure that having a 3"" layer of latex over the mattress will help prevent body indentations from forming prematurely. Thank you, Sleep On Latex! I really felt like an idiot for buying the ""wrong"" mattress. Your toppers made everything ""RIGHT"" again. :)",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Quality sleep is so important.Feel: It's perfect for me. I love the instant bounce back and can't imagine sleeping on regular memory foam now. I use a mattress pad on top to add further softness for cheaper.Smell/odor: I consider my sensitivity to smell to be average. I let the topper air out in my living room for 2 days before use.  At first I put a mattress pad (not plastic lined) on top of this latex topper.  The odor wasn't strong, but it was still definitely noticeable and I wasn't sure it was something I could live with. I was especially concerned that when summer comes and it's hotter it will get worse.I then put a vinyl/plastic mattress protector directly on top of the latex topper. Then I put a quilted mattress pad on top of that.  This was the solution. I can no longer smell it with my nose pressed into the bed or in the air.  The mattress protector is the barrier I needed.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

SleepOnLatex has the absolute best customer service I've ever experienced. My fiance (5'4 130lbs, pregnant) and I (5'10 195lbs, not pregnant but look it) have a Sleep Number bed (do not buy a Sleep Number bed, ever), and after 3 years, we've been at a crossroads. I broke 2 vertebrae in my thoracic spine 6 years ago, and have had so much pain in the middle of my back when sleeping. The Sleep Number has made that worse, as it produces pressure points on my ribs and makes me sleep unaligned (I'm a side sleeper, and air mattresses offer passive resistance, so no matter how ""soft"" your setting, it'll still feel hard). We didn't want to shell-out another $2k+ on a mattress, so out of desperation and a lot of research, we went with this topper.Before taking it out of the plastic, I thought it was going to be way too soft to offer any support. So, we initiated a return and purchased the firm. The firm was WAY too firm and resistant, and our deadline to return both was approaching. I reached out to SoL and they were SO accommodating, and said they would accept the return of both even if Amazon doesn't, and they sent out two large boxes to get our toppers in, since it's impossible to get them back into the original box. We decided to give the soft a shot, because why not, and I'm SO glad we did. It's made me look forward to going to bed now, and has increased the quality of our sleep SIGNIFICANTLY. It's incredibly comfortable, and due to it being latex, it offers some resistance, and does not sink in like a memory foam topper would. As active side sleepers, we need something that doesn't completely envelope us and take time to adjust like memory foam does.It does kind-of have an odor of latex gloves, but nowhere near what the firm had. With time and a mattress cover, it's hardly noticeable, if at all. It's also pretty heavy and slides a bit, so I definitely recommend getting a topper cover with straps for the bed corners.Overall, 9/10, will do business with again.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The perfect tea to enjoy with my husband and when friends and family visit. Great evening tea to relax and unwind after a long day. Smells amazing and tastes delicious.

I adore this tea. I have boughten Pukka tea multiple times and my favorite is the Love Tea. Highly aromatic and tastes wonderful.That being said, the last 5 orders I’ve ordered have been missing 90% of the order. I am only shipped one item out of a multipack. This is with all my orders not just this tea. In this case, I ordered a multipack of the Love tea (comes with 3 boxes), and I was shipped one. It was shipped with other heavy items I ordered separately and was smashed upon arrival. I have contacted amazon with each order and continue have these problems. If you want to order, be sure to order ahead of time to ensure you have time to complain and get a replacement. In my case even replacements have not been shipped out properly!",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I didn’t realize it has such a long steeping time.  Even with steeping at 15 min the flavor is very mild. I do not recommend. It says it has honey but I had to add honey and then lemon and and then ginger. So I realize I could just make this tea without the teabags…while I did read the description a little I expected some fancy teabag but it is just like other tea bags… my fault for being suckered by the flowery words.,-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

All of the tea bags in this set had an odd “off” bitter/sour smell.  Additionally, the brand tags on the the teabags had a different color and font (this could just be new branding) compared to the tea bags I already had at home.  Finally, I opened them up and compared the tea inside.  The tea in this set was finely ground and lighter in color.  The tea in the bags I already had was darker and had a thicker chopped appearance.  I don’t know what happened, but I wanted to put this warning out there so no one gets sick from drinking whatever is in these bags.  All I know is that it’s definitely NOT the normal Pukka tea I drink.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I haven't wanted to puke this badly since my 21st birthday. I've worked in kitchens while the grease traps are being cleaned, and that is a stench even morticians agree is worse than dead, rotting bodies, and I would gladly inhale that just to clear my nostrils of whatever was in this box. The stench is so undeniably virulent that it melted my brain and made me eloquent. I cannot stress enough just how horrible this product is. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep the contents of my stomach from rocketing out my face and spewing across the room like a scene from a movie about demonic possession. And I HATE wasting money, so I opened every individual flavour and gave them a whiff. Only one of them didn't make my stomach contract like I was hit by a linebacker. I adore tea almost as much as Uncle Iroh and was willing to try the one that didn't cause an immediate visceral reaction. That's how badly I wanted a cup of tea right now. I took two sips. It was disgusting. I feel as if I've been poisoned and I'm running a fever. I've never ordered tea online before and I never will again. I only ordered this because there was a blizzard and the local shop was closed. The package was pretty.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

So when I found this lovely looking tea set, I was hoping to buy more for gifts. I use all of the different brands of teas that help relax and help sleep. I can eat almost anything and never have food or herbal allergies. But the first night when I tried the herbal tea in this set that is made to help sleep, I became violently ill within minutes of drinking it. I don't thorw up easily and have vomited about 6 times in half a century. But this tea had me exploding out of both ends with severe stomach pains. I could not get off of the toilet to vomit so while I was having explosive dairrhea, I was also projectile vomiting TEA and even the crackers I had eaten earlier in the day. I couldn't sleep for about 5 hours because of stomach pain and the explosions from either end. It was horrific! And then I noticed the name of the brand is PUKKA, and I am wondering if this is not some twisted joke by a psychopathic tea seller. I am seriously afraid to even try any of the other three tea sets I bought on Amazon, much less any more in this disgusting tea set.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I was so excited opening the box and seeing the beautiful tea selection! The only reservation I had was that there was an overpowering sent of black licorice and I am not a fan but I noticed that there was a pack that said peppermint licorice and I was thinking that was what I was smelling. I grabbed the elderberry pomegranate flavor and tasted it and all I can taste is the black licorice. If you like that flavor it's a dream come true but this is stuff of my nightmares. The packaging is beautiful though!,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

Licorice candy is a favorite of mine. I enjoyed the taste of all the teas I tried very much, even though almost every tea contains licorice root for whatever reason (I'd love to know why). However, today I was looking on the back of one of the packets with a higher percentage licorice root content and noticed a warning about not consuming it in excess if you have high blood pressure. I looked it up online, and apparently some chemicals in licorice root can cause a serious decrease in potassium levels which can cause dangerously high blood pressure for some people. The article cited an incident where someone was drinking two glasses of licorice extract tea per day and it caused dangerously high blood pressure requiring a hospital stay.Since I have naturally high blood pressure, I now feel like I shouldn't drink the ones in the pack containing licorice root, and unfortunately, that is most of them. I think including that warning on the main product description rather than the back of one of the 9 tea packets would have been helpful for people looking to this for flavorful and healthful beverages.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

What I find is that they use a lot of licorice root in their blends (true with the blends in this set as well) which I find to be cloying. Licorice root can have health benefits so I don't object to the ingredient itself, but I personally am not a fan of the flavor.The teas in this set are not the teas from the current description. The blends are Turmeric Glow, Elderberry & Echinacea, Triple Ginger, Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey, and Blackcurrant Beauty. My favorites were ""Elderberry & Echinacea"" and ""Blackcurrant Beauty"". Although the bags say you can steep these up to 15 minutes, I prefer a shorter steeping time. For me the flavor becomes too much if I do a longer steep.The tea bags were scattered across the different sections instead of being one type to a section of the box. I felt like this was a bit sloppy for a product that is marketed as a gift. The box it came in was nice enough.Overall these are interested blends of tea but they fall short of the mark for me due to the licorice root in every blend + the presentation issues.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The amount of flavors, and their varying taste profiles, really makes this box a collection of hits or misses. On the other hand, such a large variety will allow you to quickly zero in on likes or dislikes and then you can specifically order the flavors that tickle your fancy.Matcha, Three Ginger, and Ginger and Manuka Honey are the clear favorites.  Flavorful with no odd aftertastes, a touch of stevia brings them to life. 5/5If you love black licorice and/or peppermint (which I do), it is very flavorful 4.5/5Then things start to get a little murky and the rest are strong 3's except the tumeric and echinacia  which are 1/5s and tasted very bad.Rose petal is like drinking the smell of rose flowers. At first I didn't like it, but over the years I've found it makes a great mixing tea with other flavors especially strong black teas.Overall, the collection itself is a 3/5, but remember the strength of this collection is you get to sample *9* different blends and decide what works for you.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Upon receiving and opening this box, I was instantly greeted with an aromatic herbal fragrance that was very pleasant to my senses. The bags of tea were kind of scattered out of their slots, but otherwise looked fine. Before giving this as a gift, I will have to maybe place a sheet of bubble wrap over the teas to keep them from shuffling around before she opens the box. There was a nice assortment of tea flavors, but I was expecting at least 9 different flavors for her. We instead got 5 flavors, none of which were listed in this ad, so that was a little off-putting, although of the 5 flavor teas we did get, most I know she likes and enjoys drinking anyways. It just would've been nice to get her some new flavors to try.The box itself is very pretty, nicely decorated with flowers and gold foil.

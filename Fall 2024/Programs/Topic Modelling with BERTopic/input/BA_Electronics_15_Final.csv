I have a lot of backed up shredding to do. I previously browsed online for an incinerator, but decided against that. This gets the job done. The 32 gallon bin is full at about 1 file box. It takes care of 95% of unopened envelopes. Only the thickest at about 3/16 inch will shut the machine down. I felt a bit apprehensive paying so much for a shredder, but I am very, very happy with my purchase. I am done struggling with a much, much cheaper ($100) under the desk shredder.The shredder arrived freight 9 days after it was shipped and there was an issue with the shipment. I had to send back two boxes that should not have been on my pallet. The vendor was very nice about everything and gifted me 2 boxes of shredder oil.With a supply of shredder oil along with German engineering, this shredder should last quite some time.",1,2

Three minor issues encountered.I'll get the issues out of the way first. Complaint #1: the WiFi set up was awful. I tried three times to get my password in. I finally got the printer on my home network, after a lot of annoyance. I was not able to get the printer registered into the ""HP Smart"" software system. I carefully deleted every bit of the ""HP Smart"" software. Complaint #2: the LED display panel on top of the printer has a small visible flaw, a black line that will not go away. The display is quite small and hard to read already, and this flaw is not helping. Complaint #3: it appears that the toner cartridge has an electronic chip in it. This prevents third parties from selling replacements, you have to buy the HP cartridge. Around $105 at this writing.Otherwise, a fabulous printer. After enduring two defective printers (Brother and Lexmark) I am very pleased. The print quality is terrific. In a week of use, I have not experienced any paper jams. I have printed lots of double-sided and legal size. No issues. The printer if fast. Unlike every other printer I have used, this one has a 5 GHz WiFI radio. In my home, the 5 GHz network is very much faster than the 2.4 GHz network.This is not a cheap printer, so I have to hope that it will last a few years at least. Looking at and squeezing the various plastic parts of the printer, it all seems like average quality consumer electronics to me. Thin, cheap plastic for the most part, but certainly not out of the ordinary. I am cautiously optimistic.",0,1

Cameron A. Moore,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019",1,"M404dw is a superior single or small workgroup printer.  Print output is excellent. It's fast and efficient, especially duplex printing, which is automatic as opposed to earlier models that only duplex manually.  It is also a much quieter printing LaserJet as compared to our other larger P3005d.  As this is the wireless model it came in handy printing from my iPhone and avoided the usual process of emailing photos from my phone to my computer and then printing.  Also the set up was essentially plug and play.One down side is the paper tray that only holds about half a ream.  This would tend to make this less of a work group printer if your workgroup has several large print jobs.  However, it also has a smaller footprint than the P3005d so that would be a plus if space is an issue.",1,2

Fast printing, excellent print quality and fast auto duplexer with nice ""automatic duplexing"".  Only two drawbacks, as others have noted: (1)  Expensive toner replacement and security chip forces you to use HP cartridges in the guise of ""preventing toner cartridge theft"", which is beyond unbelievable.  (2) The HP support site is one of the worst I have ever encountered.  I consider myself lucky to have downloaded and installed the correct printer drivers/software on first try, just by chance clicked on the right buttons.  Perhaps this is an offshore support site?  I would never expect such a confusing support site from such a large company and flagship products with the good reputation of HP.  God help us if we need support from the site.  Otherwise, a great little printer for routine office print jobs and check printing, if you do not have high volume demands that would make the expensive toner replacement an issue.  P.S. Generic toner replacement is available, but involves removing a chip from the old cartridge and gluing it to the new one (the printer cartridge will no longer display the amount of toner remaining) and HP states that the security chips may change over time (obviously, to discourage the competition on toner cartridge replacement).  Someone should file an unfair trade practices case on this.",1,1

One thing is common, however: HP is the most widely used in the business world and for good reasons!So, how does this monochrome (black and white-only printing) HP LJ Pro M404dw fare? Pretty well!IN A NUTSHELLThe latest addition to the LaserJet Pro line of printers produces sharp, fast, two-sided printing with business-class features and security. The cost of replacement toners is high but has the capacity to output a large number of pages. It is a well-made, compact, professional-looking printer that I have no hesitations to recommend for the home or small office.PROS- Crisp, sharp print quality for text and graphics- Fast print speed (up to 40 ppm)- Compact, sturdy, and professional looking- Printing options: WiFi, WiFi Direct (device directly connected to printer), Ethernet wired network, USB cable printing, or email--- M404dn model lacks the WiFi/WiFi Direct options--- An email address is provided through the HP Smart app to which you can forward emails to for printing- Can print directly from mobile devices (both Android and Apple iOS) either through the HP Smart app or from other apps that support mobile printing- Easy WiFi configuration by downloading the HP Smart app (Apple iOS/Android/Windows 10)--- HP Smart app effortlessly detected the printer, guiding you through configuration, usage, and provides statistical data--- Windows 10 app through the Microsoft App Store works very well- Email notification of events, such as out-of-paper or hack attempts- Duplex printing (prints on both sides) for supported sizes (letter, legal, executive, etc)- Advanced network and security configuration available (through the HP Smart app and a web browser interface)--- See ""Security"" section below for more details- Tray 1 opens on the front for checks/envelopes/manual feeding- Tray 2 holds paper for 250-sheet feeding, and a Tray 3 can be purchased- Works with HP 550-sheet feeder tray D9P29A- Came with USB cable- AirPrint: Apple Mac compatible- Google Cloud Print compatible--- To set up, the printer will waste 2 sheets: one with instructions and another to confirm setup was completed- Extended replacement toner available for VERY high capacity printing--- Included starter toner can print about 2,000 pages- Quiet mode (prints more quietly at the expense of speed), though I did not find the normal mode to be noisy- Configurable, automatic power on/off/sleep modes--- Defaults: Sleep Mode of 1 minute, Shutdown of 4 hours- Fairly light weight at 19 lbs- Additional, advanced, business-class features include--- SNMP, WINS, SLP, LPD, LLMNR, Syslog, NTP time sync--- Usage and Job reports--- Backup/Restore of settings and Firmware updatesCONS- Replacement toners are EXPENSIVE (HP 58A 3,000-pg capacity and HP 58X 10,000-pg capacity)- Did not include a network/Ethernet cableTIPS- The software to download for Windows and Mac OS is ""HP Easy Start"" which you can grab from HP's website- The software to use on mobile devices (Apple iOS/Android) is ""HP Smart""- You can access the full, complete printer configuration by finding the IP address on the printer (or through the HP apps) and typing it into your web browser- The HP Smart app includes a free trial to Mobile Fax--- Allows you to fax print jobs from the app--- Requires you to have a valid fax number (per regulation), but does not need a phone landline--- I did not check what the service's cost is after the 1 month trialSECURITYIn today's environment, information security has become more important than ever. I thoroughly appreciate HP's inclusion of features and settings to help protect one's network. Here are some of them.- Removal of Web Services--- Although the printer conveniently allows you to print from the web or via email, any route a hacker can enter from presents a vulnerability.--- The HP Smart app allows you to turn off those web services to minimize the attack footprint--- The default admin password should be changed for additional security- Network Connectivity Options--- The printer allows you to turn on/off any unused printing options, including: wired ethernet, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, AirPrint, Google Cloud Print, and the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP, IPPS)------ The IPP/ IPPS methods allow you to assign user access for printing from mobile devices- Certificates--- This topic is a BIG one on its own, and to many, a very confusing one------ In short, Certificates are like passports issued by an authority both parties trust. They help secure communication between the printer and the sender--- The HP M404dw uses a self-signed, pre-installed certificate and supports CA-signed ones that are PEM/Base64 encoded- Email Alerts--- You can be notified when a specific threshold is met (default: 1 minute)------ Cartridge missing, empty, or low------ Door open, media mismatch, paper jam, out of paper------ Job storage memory problems, such as USB device disconnected and out of memory- Firewall Rules--- Built-in firewall, complete with configuration of rule priority, address and service templates, service list--- Failsafe option where HTTPS remains accessible even if it is blocked by a firewall policy (so an admin doesn't accidentally get locked out)- Secure Communication--- Cipher suites, SSL/TLS protocols, and HTTPS redirection can be enabled/disabled- SNMP options include v1/v2 and v3- ACL: An IPv4-only access control list is available to control access to the printer- 802.1x Authentication: PEAP, EAP-TLS protocols are supported- Cartridge Protection to lock a toner to a specific printer to prevent theft--- Using a protected cartridge on another printer will not work--- The lock cannot be undone on that cartridge. It is permanentOverall, as with most HP printers, this is a quality, business-class product with the speed and sharpness the LaserJet Pro series is known for. The security features are a welcome sight! I do prefer the HP M404dw (WiFi) model (which costs $50 - $100 more) over the HP M404dn (USB/wired network) for its versatility of not having to be wired to the network, but the HP M404dn (USB/wired network) model is still a good purchase, especially at the current $219 price.If you found this review helpful, please click the ""Helpful"" button below to encourage me to write more.

I use linux and it works pretty good!  I just have three minor complaints:  1)  I am a little dissappointed in that the prints with the standard fonts I use (in LibreOffice) are not as darkly printed as when used with a canon inkjet printer ....  in other words printouts with my old inket stood out more and were more appealing.  2) This is very infrequent but it may not wake up out of sleep mode and you have to press a button and then reprint the doc.  But I consider this to be minor.  3) I like to print on used paper ... and sometimes the toner doesn't want to apply well to some of the really old paper I have been using.  Inkkets don't have this problem.  ////  Having said all of this, again, I am pretty darn happy with this printer.  It is my first laser print.  The laserjets are the most economical in the long run I have read ....  I am happy with it and would definitely purchase it again ... !!",1,1

Dont worry its made by HP and that's a normal behavior.  Wi-Fi keep dropping and printer goes offline, support have no idea what's the problem and is asking me to shut down all the devises on network and restart the modem every 5 minutes to see if problem is resolved. In a office where 50+ people are working and there are about 15 canon and brother printer already connected, it doesn't make sense to say my wifi has problem.  Anyway, after 48 hours, finally connected tow wifi but it keeps going off every 5 mins and I'm very sure this printer is going to be returned , otherwise I will shatter it into pieces and send it to HP headquarter.POOR SETTINGS:Beside the Wi-Fi issue, every time I print, printer asks me to confirm the tray size and it keep defaulting TRAY 1 as default tray, and I have made tray 2 my default and I even tried the Automatics detection. Np luck, every time I print, printer says push a button on me to make sure you have the right tray and paper size. Seriously? why you make a $400 printer stupidly complex, its a simple word document print job, why do I have to keep pushing your OK buttons to confirm my action?HP SMART APP IS A JOKE:I also installed the HP SMART app to hopefully be able to manage the printer.  Funny part is, that the app says printer offline and it keep losing the connection to the app, but I can print via usb cable.  Every time I make any adjustment in the setting inside HP SMART app, it says opps connection lost, try again and it takes me back to supply re order page. That's pretty much the only purpose of the app, just to show you HP toners and products.  I had bought HP553 color printer last year and had the same issue, but I thought maybe im doing something wrong, BUT NO, you are doing it wrong. This piece of crap its not worth hours of tech support. ITs $400 printer and it should be plug and play. And btw, Im the IT guy here and I am very confident that this crap is not worth the money and time.NOT GOOD FOR LABEL PRINTING:This printer prints very fast,  I actually wanted to make it slower becasue it messes up my prints when I print Amazon FBA labels and etc.  I don't have this problem with my canon and brother printer because I can actually adjust the speed of the printer and print slowly to make sure inks stick to labels.  But this printer prints too fast and there is absolutely no setting to change it. You can only select fine print/photo print which makes the ink bolder but printing speed doesn't change.",-2,-2

Purchased this after looking at tons of reviews of multiple brands, all searching for a printer under $500. Compared to my old printer, the print quality (assuming I could still get good toner and drum units for the Brother) is not as good as what I got from my old printer in its heyday. A decades old printer. Yup. This printer is certainly smaller and lighter, though part of the weight differential comes from the skimpiest specs possible; for example, the paper tray and adjustments are fragile compared to the old one. But that's not just this HP printer, or HP, it's everyone now. Setting up the printer was a nightmare for several reasons. It kept failing to recognize the printer when hooked up to the USB cable. I finally disconnected it and went wireless only and then it was fine, but I later discovered I had two instances of the drivers on my computer and had to sort that out. And HP's printer services are not connected to each other. In order to go through all the settings available online and on the computer, I had to sign in and re-sign in multiple, multiple times on HP's site. It kept asking me to create an account, although I had one. Again, and again, and again, and again. Then I discovered that none of HP's online presences talk to one another. I'd update my address, devices, etc. on one site, only to discover I had to do it again on another. Four total. Absolutely ridiculous. HP markets not only its hardware but its software expertise to businesses. Seems like they ought to pull all those people back into office and clean up their own mess first. Very frustrating. As to print quality, it's OK; maybe pretty good, I just can't get it as dark as I like no matter the setting. But the pages are clean. Unfortunately, although the envelope printing quality is OK, envelopes come out with a bend in the middle. Not horrible, but definitely present and noticeable. All in all, I'm OK with this purchase; I don't think I could have gotten much better quality elsewhere. I just wish I could have gotten the quality I did from a technology product I purchased in the previous century.",-1,-1

Fast, good quality, B&W printing.  No issues there.  I would've given this 5 stars...However updating the password and wifi settings requires using the HP Smart mobile app.  The printer became non-responsive/frozen during an update to settings (changing a wifi password) and never recovered.  Following a power cycle the printer never booted up again.  HP phone support after disclosures that it was out of warranty but they would make a ""one time exception for technical assistance"" (at 18 months after purchase) stated it was likely a control board and I would need to take it to an authorized repair center, fork over and unknown amount for diagnostics and repair, and that should fix it...  *insert face palm here*  Bottom line, I as politely as I could thanked them for their time and proceeded to purchase a new printer.  (Not this model.)HP, if you are reading...  Changing your wifi password as virtually every responsible business does regularly should not create a cascade failure that results in printer implosion...  Perspective buyers, if you need network printing...  stick with hard wired printers and just deal with the cord being run around the room...  Wifi is not worth the headache...",0,-1

Unfortunately, there's a bug in the firmware or AirPrint driver that prevents it from printing images and barcodes from a PDF. When I tried to print a USPS Priority shipping label, it would print the barcodes and images as solid gray boxes instead. I was able to successfully print the same shipping label on this printer via Windows and the HP Smart app which shows that the printer is capable as long as it's not printed via AirPrint. Additionally, the iOS device was able to successfully print the shipping label to a different brand printer via AirPrint (thus, it's not the iOS device that is the issue). Based on this troubleshooting, I could only conclude that there's a bug in the firmware related to how it handles printing images via AirPrint. I really wanted this printer to work because it's a solid piece of equipment otherwise. Unfortunately, when I reached out to HP to try to report the bug and see if they would work on a fix, over the course of 3 hours, I spoke to 7 individuals at HP, all in different departments, and none of them new anything about the firmware other than how to update it which I had already done. When I asked about reporting a bug, the last individual at HP refused to do so because he couldn't confirm that it was a bug which was seriously confusing.Sadly, it seems that there is some great hardware here and, mostly great software. If they could just fix their AirPrint bug, this would have been a winner. So, if you're requirements don't include printing barcodes or images via AirPrint and you don't need support, this is a great piece of kit. In the meantime, both of mine are going back. Thank goodness that Amazon stands behind what they deliver.",-1,-1

You may still buy other (after market) toner that works just fine, but you now have to transfer the toner computer chip from the original HP cartridge to the new cartridge before it will work in the printer. And, since the computer chip is not re-settable, you will not have an accurate page count or be able to tell how much toner is left in the cartridge. Most after market toner cartridges have come with built-in chips, but not this one -- at least, not yet. Had I been aware of this situation, I would not have purchased this HP printer.

Much lighter and a little smaller than my older Laserjet 4000. The reduced 250 sheet paper tray leaves 1/2 a ream sitting on the shelf, but likely won't otherwise be an issue. Duplex printing works fine. Initially, pages had a light streak just off center of both sides of the sheet, but seems to have disappeared after 10-15 sides printed. Test this first with standard paper before running print jobs with your better paper. Otherwise this printer looks to be able to fill my need. The build is less beefy than my 4000, much less metal in the construction. I hope it lasts as long as my Laserjet 4000, which still works, but was only replaced for the need of duplex printing and cartridge replacement limitations.",1,1

This printer replaces my old HP LaserJet 2420d, and is lighter, smaller, faster, less expensive, and seems to do everything the 2420d did.  It's also more versatile in the options for connecting to my network.  It is somewhat noisy, and the instructions for getting started are a bit confusing.  Method 2 for downloading the software didn't work, so I suggest using Method 1, and be sure to select the Self-managed (or IT-managed) setting first.

Carpenter,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019",4,"The overwhelming majority of documents for business does not require color.  In fact it's often a problem.  When copies need to be made, even if the original was in color the color is lost with the copy.  Most forms, details like design or computer code, or instructional text, is fine in black and white.  It looks very clean and sharp on this laser, and monochrome prints fast and efficient.  It will cost less per copy over the long run, and one type of toner is all thats needed.Printer is fairly sturdy and compact, HP makes a quality printer, and you don't have the worry of them not being around in a few years to supply the toner or replacement parts.  I still have my original printer a JUKI color four color ribbon printer in the basement.  It's been two decades now since I could get ribbons for it, so it's just a doorstop today, I was hoping for more longevity since it used the Epson driver, but the ribbons had to be made for it, and they stopped making them only a year or so after I bought it for six hundred dollars in the mid 80's.  You don't have to worry about that with HP, making printers and supplies is a prime business of theirs, sot it's not likely going away any time soon.  For the most part they are reliable, and of high quality.  Recommended.",0,1

Yes.Are the toner cartridges more expensive than the inkjet refills? Yes.Then why is it a bigger-bang-for the-buck? Because it works - and it works **really well**.I've only had the Brother inkjet for maybe six months and I've constantly had to clean the heads before printing (once I had to clean them 6x before it would print two pages). Then when my son needed to print his school assignment, it wouldn't. I went through all of the troubleshooting steps for the ""Unable to Print 50"" error. And when I got to the end of their online steps, it said ""Your machine will require service. Contact support for warranty options"".Better yet, I'll just buy a printer that works...I'm *not* an HP fan - far from it; but this printer works.As for setup, the WiFi config process was a bit convoluted but I got it working and I was printing within 30 minutes of unboxing/installing the drivers.Most importantly, and this **CANNOT** be understated: I'm no longer getting cold stares from the family or yelled at from across the house for a printer that doesn't work.When it prints within seconds of sending a print job - <sigh of relief>.When my son smiled happily that it printed on both sides of the paper without him doing anything (auto-duplexing) - <warm fuzzies>.When I don't have to waste my time troubleshooting a printer: <nirvana>.You can't put a price on the above...Of course with all technology, YEMV (Your Experience May Vary) - but so far, I'm a happy camper.",1,2

I found it is somewhat difficult to do the 5.0x8.5  printing on both sides as it often takes two sheets in rather than just one and messes up the paging of the booklets I often print. My old HP does better since it has an open front so I can hold the pages with my fingers so they are taken in one at a time. Otherwise the printer is very good and faster than the others I have.,0,1

Blackburn,2020年3月7日 在美国审核,3,I have purchased many Brother laser printers over the past 15 years and been very pleased with the printers and print quality until this printer.  The first issue was the printer cable.  The connection on the printer end had a different plug configuration so I had to run the new cable which was about 6 inches to short so I had to buy an extension cable.After less than a couple of hundred pages a problem with the toner started.  I took the cartridge out and removed the excess toner built up.  After a few pages the printer starts dropping excess toner again and all the pages seem to have a very light coating of toner.  I looked on the Brother web site but i was not able to find a solution.  I believe there is a problem with the drum and toner assembly.The printer is very fast and works well except the toner issue.  When I saw the reviews about the toner problem I assumed it was an isolated problem.  It seems odd that some people have no issues and others do.  I hope it resolves itself hen I replace the toner cartridge.,-1,-1

I don't believe anything out there on the market can beat this printer on those objectives.I bought the two year extra warranty just in case if it needs a large repair, however I doubt I will need it. It was only $20 and they pay for shipping and all the repair costs. However, for a minor repair I will take it to my local printer repair shop since I need to use it everyday.I have to add some important info about the printer. It said the yield for the DR280 drum unit is 30,000. So I assumed that's how much pages my new Brother will print. Actually, that's just the drum unit yield, not the toner yield. Like every printer on the market, your first toner will have a low yield. Mine yielded about 3300 pages. It was then that I realized that the drum unit and toner are two different parts with separate yield. The great thing about this printer is that it takes high capacity cartridges which yield 8000 pages.",1,2

The setup process on my MacBook Pro took less than two minutes.  The USB cable was not supplied.  It comes with some old out dated cable from 1992.  Im so glad I had the cable to make this printer work immediately after receiving it. Print quality is good, especially for the price. However, it does bleed some black toner on the papers but I’m guessing this will eventually stop.  Not a major concern.  I really like the auto duplex mode allowing to print on both sides automatically.  I bought this printer to replace my old Samsung colour laser printer.  Hopefully this printer will last me years without major issues.",0,1

After fixing that, awhile later it started smudging every print.Kyocera's support is all but worthless, and MS had issues with their drivers more often than not, to the point it would never print in full black.  It was like a half shade.The scanning was never very good, and Kyocera's desktop software is horrible.Worst printer I've even had!  (PS I bought this because I'd had Kyocera's before, and they were amazing.  But no more.  I'll NEVER buy this brand again!)And to add insult to injury, the warranty has expired.",-2,-2

Since my device did not include any paperwork, I had to locate the operation manual online.  Calls to the seller, BeachAudio only resulted in them referring me to the manufacturer for assistance.  They also assumed I wanted a refund, when all I needed was some technical assistance.  As for the device itself, it is a powerful machine that does everything a small business or family could need.  It's fast and quiet. I appreciate the wireless functionality as I do not need to tether it to my desktop.  Envelopes are fed through the front panel which opens up.  For those needing to print large amounts, I believe an accessory tray is available.  This device only comes with one tray which can support various paper sizes, although we have it setup for standard copy paper.",1,0

My key functions requires are scanning and printing.  Not a high page volume, but good print quality is important.I do not connect my printers via wifi, I have found that regardless of who makes the printers, a wifi connection is not reliable.  I unboxed the printer, followed all instructions, and hooked the printer up to my computer directly via USB port.  Now on any other printer I have set up, that type of connection is very simple and reliable.The printer did print for me from my computer, but it seems to take a lot of time to warm up and print a page.  Not like 10 seconds, more time than that.  Like when you hit print then wait.....and wait....and wait.....then start wondering ""did I not finish submitting the print job?""  Then you go back, hit print again, then right when you hit print the first job finally starts.  That would be annoying in time.I found the desktop app which is similar to the app I had with my old HP.  I tried to scan and for some reason, the app cant find my printer.  Everything I tried, no luck being able to have my computer and printer communicate to scan.  How can it print but not scan?  I tried the printer controls, incredibly vague and seems to want to scan to email.  What about scanning to a computer?  Its like Kyocera felt that was not important.  Scan to a thumb drive, sure thats there.  But what about my computer?  I am not a spy, I want to scan to my computer.The instructions are a joke.  They only cover 5-6 steps on the install and provide one line of instructions per step.  Then have that translated to 10 different languages so its hard to find anything helpful.  I tried going online, again nothing.I am returning the device and getting something different.  I bet the printer works fine and it requires a technician to install it so it works.  That is kind of ridiculous for no networking being involved.  Even if I bite the bullet and pay the $150 to have a tech come out and install it, what happens when I get another computer?  Another $150?  This is not a device that is easy to set up.  If you have your own IT department, ok it may be fine.  But if you want a printer for your office or home and dont have an IT department, this is not a good choice.",-1,-2

I did not purchase any service contract with this printer (BIG mistake!) and had to call local shop who charged $150 to look at it and tell me it needed a new color scanner, or a $300 repair!I kept using it just to fax, copy and scan in B&W, but just two weeks ago the Automatic Document Feeder stopped copying or scanning!

It has everything you need in a fairly compact space.  The printer is not exactly small, but it isn't overly large either.  It is a perfect size for the powerhouse that it is.  The printer is heavy.  Believe it weighs in around 47 lbs.  It would be best to have two people moving it around, but I was able to carry it up 3 floors and install it by myself.  One person can install it if they are careful.  You would not want to drop it or bang it around.  There are a lot of small moving parts in this printer that could be damaged.The duplex printer and scanner work great.  I have printed hundreds of duplex pages through this so far and it works flawlessly.  The duplex scanner works well also, but it cannot always be controlled from the printer. When at the printer you can duplex scan and copy to 1 or 2 sided pages no problem; however, you cannot scan to another computer or fax Duplex (2-sided pages) from the printer.  There is no menu option in the scan to computer or fax modules to select 2-sided scan.  It will only do one side or you can set it to do continuous scan and flip the pages one at a time.  IMHO, that was a big miss by Kyocera.  Seems like an oversight for whoever designed the Pinter UI.  The printer can scan two sided pages, but you can't scan to a computer from the printer 2-sided pages.  The only 2-page scanning option is to remote control the scanner from a computer.  Their software has the duplex option in it, but that is nowhere near as convenient as being able to do everything from the printer.  In a larger office this could also be a pain.  The document needs to be loaded and you have to walk back to your desk to scan.  If someone else tries to use the scanner during the same time it could cause problems.  This is the same issue with faxing.  Can only fax 1-sided pages from the printer.Overall this is a great printer at a great price.  I would love to see a firmware update to enable 2-sided scan to computer and fax, but other than that it is perfect.  The print quality is superb.  The letters are crisp and clean.  The color reproduction is not photo-paper quality, but it is excellent for a laser printer.  Images look great to me.  Everything about this printer is pro-quality.  The output of this printer is as good or better than large systems that are 100x the cost.",2,1

Its been to complicated to resolve the issue over the phone with technicians.  I do understand why they doing this but as for home use its quite a challenge to get this machine working properly..... I think if Kyocera resolve this issue for some products the market will open up for them and they will be TOP DOG when it comes to home use printing.  Reliability so far so good i did not have any issues and i expect machine to be working for very long time.  Tech support is awesome, this people take care of customers really good probably the best Tech support i had in a long time, very professional and intelligent when it comes to Information Technology..  All i can say Kyocera has bright future if they can innovate and keep Reliability... Good Luck",1,1

I got tired of having to clean it all the time.  Since my wife mainly uses black and white printout 99% I was looking for an easy to use and reliable printer for her while I took the Ink Jet to my office.  I unboxed and carefully followed the instructions about how what to do before turning on the printer. I used the ethernet port plugged in directly to the router.  I also went into the router and reserved the IP address for the printer so that DHCP wouldn't keep changing its IP port.  If your printer (regardless of the kind you have) seems to keep getting dropped by the network, you may want to do this.  Installed the drivers on her desktop and it found the printer, and everything worked.  My wife is thrilled that the paper loads from a tray and does double sided printing.  Fonts come out nice and crisp and the refill cartridges are somewhat reasonable.  To tell the truth all printer cartridges are way overpriced from what they have to be. So far so good.

So far it's been great.I have gotten tired of cheap printers and expensive cartridges, that don't work or quit working after a short while. Just replaced a canon imageclass color printer that quit working after years of struggle.Kyocera seems to be environmentally conscious and focused on quality vs quick profit.Trivial to set up (over network/dhcp/nmap), works seamlessly with mac and windows, all generic drivers. I use wired ethernet. The only thing to know - it took literally half an hour to transfer toner from a cartridge once powered up for the first time. After that, it's super quick.It should be very serviceable, with lots of replaceable parts. Cartridge contains only toner, and it's cheap at $60 for a genuine one. Drum is a separate part which should last way longer than usual. And there are more parts which could be replaced if needed. Could be cleaned too.Read the manual!  And follow the advice of those who know - don't buy cheap color printers. Print color at your office on big business machines. Consumer printers are mostly crap.",1,1

HP printers were the worst for their ability to eat ink like crazy. This printer is super reliable and prints amazingly well. You should know though that my main concerns for any printer:- prints well- reliable- doesn't ink well like crazyIt fulfills all of those. Canon and HP ate ink, Brother wasn't reliable.On a side note, other reviewers said the installation instructions are difficult. I haven't had issues but it could be the case perhaps because I have decided to connect the printer via ethernet to my Wi-Fi router and the printer has a static IP address. No problems with installation - it took about 10 mins total. However, super sorry for the folks that had issues though, I am, fortunately, quite satisfied with installation instructions. Other than this being a great printer, it's definitely a worthy investment.",1,2

If you want to print a sheet of labels, or an envelope, or anything other than 8.5x11 paper, you have to change print settings both in your application (MS Word) and in the printer itself through the little LCD display menu on the machine. THEN you can print. So what is automatic on every other brand of printer becomes a ridiculous chore every single time you want to print. With my Brother 6200DW, which I replaced with this, all I had to do was move the slider on the MP tray, put the envelope in, and the printer knew exactly what I was doing and printed.

Carneal,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2020",1,"The HP Laser Jet Pro M404dn Prints great... lousy software... little or no good technical support from HP.Before purchasing this product did research.  We checked drivers for it on HP's website.  We also downloaded the User's Guide and checked supported Operating Systems.  They provide drivers for just about every Windows O/S that would still be in use, including all variants of Windows 2008 R2.  We still have one of these and this is where the printer is going to be defined and shared by other hosts.  That server will not be migrated up for at lease one more year so it has to work.When we received the printer, we installed it as a network printer locally on a Windows 10 system... it worked.We then uninstalled it from the windows 10 system and installed it as a network printer locally to a Windows 2008 R2 server and it installed fine.We set up a share for it and installed it using the share to other hosts (Windows 10 and Windows 7).  They printed to it just fine through the Windows 2008 R2 server.  We also tried it on a XP system, where we would expect it to fail and it did, but it failed ""cleanly"" like it was suppose to.Then we tried to print a document (test page) from the Windows 2008 R2 server itself.  It placed the report in the print spool, and indicated the job completed (in the queue... out of the queue, no errors).  At the printer, the printer startup but no pages came out.OK, we have two bugs here.First when the report was released to the printer, it behaved as any print job would that was successful (no error).  The job was removed from the print spool queue.  This is a very serious problem.Second, the job did not print at all.  The printer started up but no output.  This is an annoyance, I wanted a report and did not get one.Called HP Support to open a case for this issue.  I was on the phone for two hours the first day and another hour the second day... what a waste of time.HP told me to use the PostScript driver (I already tried it), it did not work.  With the tech on the phone I tried every driver they had on their website for Windows 2008 R2... none worked.HP end up saying even though it says it is supported in the User's Guide, and drivers exist for it on their website, they do not support it.  They referred me to an obscure document that does not have it listed.  Even though 2008 R2 is past Microsoft support, which occurred on January 14, 2020, the printer has been out for over a year before that.  People were running 2008 R2 then, and some are still today.It appears that HP has no interest in fixing programming errors in their drivers, or at least that is how their support staff presents their solutions.So, I would throw this printer in the trash, except I like the printer and it works on other hosts  connected to it.So, it you expect some kind of useful support other than how to turn the device on, FORGET HP.  It still is a good printer, so if you do not mind basically supporting it yourself, and do not have a problem with their documentation saying it supports something, and having technical support say it really does hot support it, than this is a good printer.  After this experience  I doubt I will not be buying any more HP products for myself any time soon.",-2,-1

This is the boss's review:I got this printer because I print a lot of documents daily.  Since day one I have had nothing but problems.  In addition to paying for a new printer, we have had to pay our IT guy for at least 2 trips to the office and numerous remote sessions trying to fix things (which they fix temporarily).  This has been a lemon from day one!The first thing it started doing was printing garbage across the top of the page (no document…just garbage), for pages and pages.  I had to open the paper drawer just to get it to stop!  The next thing it did was give me errors whenever I added paper (or other times for no reason at all).  It wouldn’t print unless it was adjusted.  Today, after our IT guy left from his third visit – the printer was put back to its factory defaults which prints double sided - again!  If I want it to print single sided I have to go into settings and change the default….for every single document I print (e-mail or documents).  I have never had such a bad experience with a printer over my 25 plus years of practicing law.  I would be rich if I billed HP for the time spent dealing with this printer!  We pay for a new printer, we pay for it to be fixed – but only temporarily – and we pay for the wasted time dealing with the worthless printer!  And every time it is “fixed” it slows down the printing time – which was one of the reasons I got the printer in the first place!After this experience I will never purchase another HP product again!",-2,-2

This new HP LaserJet Pro M404dn is much faster when printing. There is a pause after clicking the print key while the printer figures out what to do. Then when it starts to print it is fast. So far so good. This printer does NOT have wifi. I don't want wifi in my house because of the EMF radiation. (Beware 5G)Con: I give it 4 stars because I copy images from pictures and put them on pages in Word files about subjects and resize them on the page by dragging the corners. 80% of the time when printing the page the printer will not print the page as you see it after resizing. (What you see is what you get - WYSIWYG.)  It will print the page with the picture as it was before being resized. If it originally was a large picture that won't all fit on the page it will print the page with just a portion of the picture on the edge of the page and the rest of the picture is lost.If anyone knows how to fix this please reply and let me know. Thank you.Otherwise I am happy with the printer.,1,1

I'll assume you're using a Windows PC.

Skip it for now if you want to potentially save time. If this guide doesn't work without the [OPTIONAL?] steps, then start from the beginning and do every step, including the [OPTIONAL?] ones.[OPTIONAL?] Remove the printer from Printers & Scanners within Settings in Windows.Connect the printer to your PC using the USB printer cable.Go to https://123.hp.com/laserjet to download drivers for the printer.Run the setup program and follow the steps to set up the printer over USB.When installation completes, try printing a page to ensure the printer works.Disconnect the USB printer cable from your PC.[OPTIONAL?] Remove that copy of the printer from Printers & Scanners within Settings in Windows, as this copy of the printer will only work over USB.Plug the ethernet cable back into your printer.[OPTIONAL?] Run the setup program again and follow the steps to set up the printer over ethernet.Try printing a page. The printer should be working now.[OPTIONAL?] Stoop down in front of the printer so you're at eye level, then lean in toward it so your face is close to the front of the printer. Now, sternly say to the printer, ""Now, don't you EVER do that again!"" as you point your index finger authoritatively at the printer.Aggravating? Very much so. Will the ""offline"" issue pop up again? Probably. Printers gonna printer. They're all ultimately junk, and they'll all ultimately break, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. This printer's quite good when it works, though. Honest.",0,0

It is very easy to get around this problem. As shown in the pictures access the printer web server. Go to Settings, then Supplies. Set the Cartridge Low Settings to Custom and 1%. The other setting should be continue, off, off. This will eliminate the low toner warning and refusal to print.The printer web interface shows a new toner with enough remaining to print just 50 pages.

I've installed a lot of printers on a lot of computers and networks over the years and this product stands out as the worst, most confusing, and frustrating of all of them by a wide margin.  The instructions are unclear and don't seem to follow any logic.  When I went to the website as instructed on the enclosed piece of rice paper, I ended up at a commercial driver site and I did not trust anything that I saw there.  Instead I went ahead and plugged the printer is with a USB cord as instructed and it seemed a little bit happy.  That was an illusion because some new instructions came up on the computer screen which asked if I wanted USB or network connection for the printer.  Now you ask me!!  After it's already been set up for USB.  I finally gave up and just let the HPSmart application I already had in place on the computer do the set-up.  When all the dust settled, I had 3 versions of the printer listed as available for printing but only one of them actually worked.  The others were offline--and the HPScanDoctor didn't seem to be able to figure this out and it sort of threw up its hands.It does finally work but no thanks to HP.  It's a nice printer but if you want one of them you should have the installation of a few printers and wrestling with connections and ""off line"" issues under your belt.  And be prepared for a dogfight with HP and its ""helpful"" website.",-1,-1

Great idea!  It was so simple to go on line and get the software, latest additions, and even videos on how to do it all.  What could be easier.I set this up in minutes and realized afterwards that it was done correctly.  You want to print something there is a slight delay while it transfers to the printer, but then just like that it prints!  You can print one side or two sides.  The choice is yours.  You just plug it in and connect a USB cable and you basically are done.  The on/off switch is convenient, right in front.Paper loads by pulling a tray out front and it holds a lot of paper!Recently I had a conversation with my computer tech guy and what he told me was that the laser jet printers are a lot better than the other types of ink printers.  Reason...they are powder and do not dry out.  If you do not use a printer a lot of the time, it will dry out with regular ink and have to clean the heads which can be a pain.  With this printer you can leave it and it will do all you want on command.Main difference with this type of printer is the cost of the cartridge.  HP sells 3,000 copy cartridge for about $105 delivered.  They have a 10,000 copy one for a bit over $220.  This is the only drawback, but the speed and copy quality is really great and I would imagine that there will be a reduction in price of the cartridges when there is more competition in the market place.Excellent item and highly recommended.  By the way, it is only in black and white.  There are color models which you might want to consider as well!",2,2

J.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2020",5,"Read many reviews talking about the problems of printing from a chromebox and/or chromebook.  What you need is an IPP / CUPS printer.I purchased this HP LaserJet404dn and connected it to my network using an ethernet connection.  Now the printer is connected directly to my home router.  Based on my research I assigned the printer a static IP address and can easily print from my Android phone, my chromebooks, my chromeboxes and any window’s computer.  In fact this HP printer has what is known as HP Smart capability where you can send an email to your printer with the attachment you wish to print.  That means you can send a print job to your printer from anywhere.My Android phone and chromebook automatically discovered the printer.  For the chromebox I found it better to simply add the printer using the static IP address.  Without a static IP address, when the printer went into sleep mode, the printer did not appear on the list of available printers on my Chromebox.  Without the static IP address I also found that after I manually woke the printer from its sleep mode, the printer did not immediately appear as available from my chromebox.I also read complaints that this printer has a toner cartridge with a chip, thus forcing you to only purchase HP toner.  The toner does have a chip, but you can easily turn off the cartridge policies.  See the owners manual for more details.If you purchase the right printer and configure it correctly, there are absolutely no printing issues when using your Chromebook, Chromebox and/or Android device.  I can now easily print from any of my Google / Android and windows devices to this HP printer.  I am not an Apple customer, but the printer manual indicates compatibility with Apple products.  I am very happy with this printer and would highly recommend it for any Google Chromebook, Chromebox and/or Android users.Print on Google lovers!",2,2

I can’t believe the amount of papers they have to print out. But anyway, we now have this, and we love it! This is a nice, compact, business-grade laserjet printer. Since it’s small, we could put it on the corner of the desk without taking up too much space or being too tall. When it prints, it's quicker and quieter than our other printer. The paper tray is easy to load and holds a bit more than half a ream of paper. The only thing my husband needed to do to make it discoverable on our home office LAN was to grab a network cable and plug it into the Ethernet switch and turn on the power, and then going to HP’s website to get the drivers. We've been using it daily for about 2 weeks without any trouble and its built-in web server makes it easy for hubby to manage or monitor nearly every aspect of the printer without having to use something called SNMP. He found there was a firmware update and was able to update the printer directly through the web interface without having to download any updating software. He was also impressed that it was designed with business security in mind with a bunch of authentication, encryption, and management security protocols built-in. We are extremely happy with this printer, and I’m glad we got it. If it would print color, it would be perfect! Highly recommend!",2,2

Yes, you have to hard-wire this model, if you want wireless get the dw, but that's on you. My printer stays in my ""electronics cabinet"". I like that I can buy a cheaper printer since I neither want nor need wireless.When you get the printer, there is no built-in driver for windows, so you just go to HP's website. Make sure you run the firmware update, and then simply install the bundled driver.It is just the _smallest hair_ confusing due to HP's extraordinarily bad website. For example, what is a ""M404/M405dn"" ? Is that an M404 and an M405dn, or an M404dn and an M405dn? I'm pretty sure it's the latter, because it's what I installed for the M404dn and it's great. There are also three different downloads - an app, a ""simple driver installer"", and the simple drivers without the installer. When I downloaded just the drivers, there's no way in Windows to install them, so I tried the ""simple driver installer"". I always hate an app running around just when I'm trying to print, so I didn't install that, and I ignored the HP app that tried to install when my printer was found. HP clearly wants to grab all your data but I just want a printer. All of that is not SO hard to navigate, and my printer is working ( and looking really good! ) after the first try. Just download the firmware and install it, and the driver package and install it, and you're done.So much better than the Brother printer it's replacing - we'll never buy another Brother.",-2,1

They have their defaults that will tie you up for a half hour before you accomplish (use the term in its loosest way) anything.  It’s working to, I have had to abort every call then 24 hours later I get an email case closed- resolved. Must be nice.the printer is large, and the print quality is good.  Don’t get me started on the chipped cartridges.  Reading that HP wants to ensure its customers only the best quality output and running counterfeit cartridges could lower their satisfaction with HP products is as orwellianly backwards.  I don’t work for a fortune 1000 company - who can afford HP Toner but those that get huge discounts because of the amount of installed units.I have owned the printer for a year and have had constant problems.  It is a shame because I have owned HP lasers since my first HP4 with a jet direct 10/100 about 30 yrs ago.  I cannot recommend this printer.",-1,-2

There are multiple problems, some of which are systemwide for HP and some of which appear to be that I got a lemon. Lemon Problems: 1) It cycles through sleep/wake up like every minute. I actually timed it once. It goes into sleep mode at 10:19 am, wakes up before 10:20, whirs and clicks for about a minute, then turns off again...then right back on less than a minute later. It was crazy making! I have to turn the machine off when I'm not trying to print or it drives me crazy. So, every time I need to print or scan anything, I have to turn the machine on and wait for it to warm up. PITA! 2)Today, I came into my office (at home because pandemic) and had to print something first thing before settling down to work on a deadline. Printer won't print! I can see the job in the job queue on my computer, I can see the printer view screen responding to the information being sent, but the printer never prints anything. I've tried changing to a different network (I have several), I tried turning it off and turning it on again, I tried changing to direct print. Nothing. Then, in the midst of this, I get a blue screen with an error code. That was the last straw for me. My IT person told me he thought the sleep/wake issue was a sign of a lemon and I should return. So, today, I came here to log a return, only to find out the return window is one month and it's over. So, my only option is tech support and HP has me on hold rn. They told me that *if* they determine replacing the machine is the thing to do, it will be replaced with a refurbished machine, not a new one. That is utter bu11sh1t. I'm pissed. I run a non-profit. We aren't made of money. We had a grant that covered this. Giving us a used printer when this is 100% an HP-cause problem is unacceptable. NOW, for the HP-system wide problem. If you use a MAC, you will not be able to scan to email. In fact, it sounds like no one can scan to email because everyone in the world has updated their security protocols EXCEPT HP. So, there is that. You will have to scan to thumb drive and then plug that in to your ocmputer and then move the files over. Who has time for that?! Get it together, HP!!!",-2,-2

This is the first time I’ve ever owned an HP product of any kind, and as we all know, HP printers and your toner cartridges are not cheap in any way.So, is this some kind of a toner rip-off scheme?

It came off fairly easily but did rip in half and get pretty crumpled up which I thought was odd.I proceeded to set up the printer and test everything but when I tried the copier with a page fed through the top tray, everything jammed up.  It's at this point after googling for answers my brain finally registered the ""red circle with a slash"" over the piece of flimsy plastic covering the scanner surface.  I felt pretty stupid until I looked at the comments online and realized MANY people make the same mistake.  Seriously HP... you shower the printer with all kinds of little pieces of plastic protective film and this looks no different, but you highlight this particular piece and actually have a diagram of a hand pulling it off.  I know I should have properly registered the fact that there was a ""circle and slash"" over it, but clearly I'm not alone in misinterpreting this!  How about WORDS that say DO NOT REMOVE!I tried going to HP support and it simply does not work.  I can't log in, register the product or an account, etc.  It's been one hell of a frustrating day with HP!!!  Can someone here tell me how I can get a replacement piece of cheap plastic for the copy scanner head / feeder???  This piece TOTALLY looks like an afterthought fix for something that clearly wasn't working properly.

In the first week, the Error Code wanted new toner cartridges at $109. each x 4. (the cartridges that come with the printer are a teaser with 2 days worth of toner).  Now, 2 months into using the new cartridges, another Error Code.  They opened a warrantee repair ticket....and a week later, finally a repair man, He cant fix it!!!....HP wants to send me a refurbished one!  I paid $440 for a NEW one 2 months ago...and it will take more time to receive this used replacement!  there has been a lack of customer service saying they have to put the request into a different department.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT..... It is false advertising that they will come and repair in one business day.  It has been 9 days now...and still I have this defective printer on my desk....I need a printer today!  I guess I forget the $1000. I have into this one and go buy a different brand.  it is junk.  and I am seriously disappointed.  Do not order any electronics from amazon...lesson learned.  There is zero customer service from Amazon....and HP has lied to me every time I called...I have about 5 hours on the phone so far with HP warrantee....and still no end in sight.",-2,-2

Hughes,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023",1,"This HP Pro MFP M479fdw prints fine until you need to buy a set of replacement ink / toner cartridges which cost nearly as much as a brand-new machine. Then the HP Pro MFP M479fdw becomes nothing more than a paperweight.HP places chips in their ink / toner cartridges and requires you to only use their refills. The problem is that their refills are incredibly expensive, and no better than non-OEM cartridges.There is no way to disable this feature from the firmware, so once you buy the HP printer, you are forced for the life of the machine to pay whatever HP decides to charge. You have no right to repair or replace the HP ink or toner cartridges at all.This printer now costs me more to own and operate than any other laser jet on the market, and I will never again buy an HP-- personally or professionally. This is an awfully exploitive and restrictive business practice on the part of HP.",-2,-2

Bottom line: DO NOT install any of it if you can get away with it and trust the operating system will take care of it. None of the online articles were of any help. The so-call ""HP Doctor"" was completely useless in diagnosing any issues and gave up cryptic error messages. Basically, the ""automatic"" installation software just made it NOT work. Seriously, who wrote this crap!?!?!I guess you can always try being on the phone, for hours, dealing tech support that you can only understand every other word who will do nothing but to tell you to reboot your computer and power cycle your printer ad nauseam while walking you thru their useless support scripts. That did not sound particularly appealing to me and my eyes would probably roll so hard that they would get stuck at the back of my head.Instead, I took a step back and went back to basics, install the device drivers, let Windows handle the installation, MANUALLY pick the device drivers and what do you know, it worked!!

He had no interest in the product, HP, or my case.  When I asked him a question, he seemed startled that I was still there and eventually got irritated with me, even though I was the one who blew 1000.00 on a defective printer.  After 4 hours, he basically gave up and said he would have another department look at it.  I asked for the number of the department and he said there is no way to get in touch with them. Recommend you short HP stock as this is the worst tech company in the world.  Sells defective printers that weight a ton, cost a ton, and with no committed support behind it.

Immediately I received an error code that paper is jammed inside the printer (Event Code 13.14.14).  I tried numerous times to find any paper inside the printer and couldn't find any paper.  I hadn't even loaded paper into the paper tray(s) at this point because i had just completed the online setup.  I atttempted to rectify the issue by following the online troubleshooting steps and was completely unsuccessful becasue the troubleshooting steps only address paper feeds that can be cleared.  Since i didn't have a paper feed issue, none of the troubleshooting steps worked.  My next step was to contact an online support representative and they were unable to correct rhe issue.  I attempted to contact a representative via phone but was unable to call because i was outside normal business hours and the HP support page doesn't list the phone number outside normal working houts.To say the least, this is a brand new (tefurbished) model that failed at the starting line, leaving me bitterly disappointed, disgruntled, and frustrated.Therefore, my one-star rating is generously given for a no-star product.",-2,-2

The new one (M479fdw) was purchased after 5-years of good experience with each of two predecessor M477fdw models.  But the M479 was a disappointment; a faint pink/violet tint was added to all graphics, particularly renderings of computer screens using a light gray background.  I spent an hour on the phone with an HP rep who was VERY knowledgeable, but nothing he suggested improved things.  Ultimately I returned the HP M479fdw for a refund, and purchased a printer from another manufacturer.  I don't know if this particular M479fdw had a manufacturing flaw, or if this model has an engineering flaw.  Next printer, I would likely try HP again.  They are a great company and I simply had a bad experience.",-1,-1

Impossible to connect to any desktop via cable - believe it or not the HP tech support (four different techs) all told me same thing - you cannot connect this printer to a desktop via cable since the printer is manufactured with a non-compatible, old-type USB port that does not work with modern (= less than 10 years old) desktops. Spoke with HP tech support 29 times at over one hour per session, and absolutely nobody can fix the multiple issues. Terrible unit, terrible tech support.

Findlay,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2021",1,"My old injet HP printer (5 years old) quit working and repairs were half the cost of a new machine. So, purchased this Laserjet model. I liked the ease of well written software to start up the last printer. Did not happen this printer. Buggy, and even with downloading their ScanDoctor software, could never get this machine to print. Very different experience than 5 years ago. And even though this model is made for an office environment (I will use this for home use only) it's over engineered to be as cheaply made as possible. Plastic drawers are as thin walled as is possible, and kind of wobbly. No more HP printers for me. I will call the Help Desk or return this model.",-2,-2

We first ordered the ""Enterprise"" version of this printer (model #M480F), which is essentially the same but with a higher ""pages per month"" rating. It arrived completely useless with a defective fuser. HP tech support agreed. We were able to return it to Amazon, and then we purchased the M479. At first, everything seemed fine with the new printer. I tried to order the optional 3rd paper tray. It arrived, but it would throw a jamming error any time it tried to grab a piece of paper. Again, HP determined that it was a defective unit and it was replaced. The second one has been fine. Now, flash forward to a month or two later:The M479 comes installed with some cheap introductory toner cartridges with limited capacity. I expected that these wouldn't last too long, but we also don't print anything with color in the office. The printer eventually told me they were empty, so we purchased a full set of high-capacity color cartridges (which cost approximately $600). When I installed these brand new genuine HP cartridges, the printer recognized them as having the same capacity as the introductory cartridges (I think it's only like 150-200 pages?). In fact, the embedded web server showed that new introductory cartridges were installed and that they were not the high-capacity version. Weird. I figured it wasn't a big deal, because if the cartridges have toner in them, then we'll still be able to print color. It shouldn't matter what the display says, right?Wrong. About a month later, after barely printing any color pages, the printer again told me that the cartridges were empty. They were not. They were still heavy and obviously full of toner. So again, I contact HP. After hours of troubleshooting and trying various methods to reset the printer, they determined that it was a defective unit and acknowledged that something was very wrong. We were also out of warranty. At this point, the color cartridges had begun to seize and squeak. Even though they were still full, the printer was telling these cartridges to act like they were empty (hence the squeaking and seizing, the grinding, the constant messages telling us that the cartridges are empty). It's important to mention that these noises from the seizing and leaking cartridges are still audible when you're only printing in black and white.So after purchasing 4 separate pieces of hardware from HP, 3 of them were delivered as defective. We purchased $600 worth of color toner and were told ""sorry"" when the printer refused to acknowledge which cartridges were actually installed. We've also seen multiple error messages which indicate a fuser motor defect. This printer is now two years old and has printed 60,000 pages. Sure, it still prints in black and white, but the noises are unbearable. I'm talking about a solid 80-90 decibel screech. You can't even talk on the phone if someone is printing something. HP's suggestion was to replace the color toner cartridges, because they make noise when they run out! Great, so the noises will go away for another month or two at a cost of $600 and then you'll tell us to replace them again when the printer decides they're empty? It is now essentially useless to us and we wasted more money on toner than it cost to buy the entire thing in the first place. We're replacing it with a Brother. I will never purchase hardware from HP again.I'm giving this 2 stars because the scanning/copying features have been fine and have never failed us.",-2,-2

Then I saw the newer M479fdw was on sale for $398, only $50 more and decided it to buy it, since it was to be a newer better model and with 2-sided scanning. But after using both models for the past week, I can say that the M281fdw is the better built unit, while the M479fdw has some issues.First off, the M479 has a very loud cooling fan that always stays on while the unit is on (even when not printing). The only way to stop the fan is to have the unit set to go into Sleep Mode after 10 minutes of non-use. When printing, there is also a noticeable high-voltage electrical sound coming from the vents on the right side. This is the only laser printer that I've ever heard this type of sound from, and it just sounds like there's an electrical problem. The M281 model doesn't have a loud cooling fan that stays on all the time (in fact, I'm not sure if it has a fan) and there is no high-voltage transformer buzzing when it prints.Regarding the actual printing, for Black Text and basic color documents, both M479 and M281 are identical. But when it comes to printing a color picture, the M281 produces better looking and more realistic colors, while the M479 colors are more dull/faded and don't match the original picture. I made sure both printers are using the same color settings and have the newest Firmware and Drivers installed. But no matter what I try, the color pictures from the M479 don't look as good as from the M281.Lastly, for copying Black Text, both models are the same, with the advantage of 2-sided scanning on the M479. But for color copying, the M479 looks terrible. I tried to copy a few pictures (that where original film-to-paper prints or from an inkjet) and the color copies on the M479 look way off. But on the M281 the color copies are much closer to the original.That being said, the M479 is Made in Mexico and the M281 is made in Vietnam, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.Overall, I wish the M479fdw worked as well for colors as the M281fdw, as I like the 2-sided scanning and the larger LCD Display. But the loud cooling fan and high-voltage electrical buzzing on the M479 are a deal-breaker for me. Between the two, I just like the M281fdw more, it prints better colors, is a quieter and smaller unit, and feels better made.",-1,-1

I had read some thoughtful reviews that reported difficulties with setup. So I was fully prepared to run into a wall at some point in the process.I followed the instructions about unboxing (in other words turning the box in its side), and removing the tape from various places. I opened up various covers to make sure I wasn’t missing any tape hidden inside. There was none. I inserted paper and plugged it in.It powered up quickly. The touch screen menu is excellent. It is colorful, uncomplicated, and it responds quickly to the touch, like a smartphone.I downloaded the software onto my computer from the hp website and, though it took a bit of time, the software installed perfectly. It recognized the printer and installed itself for wireless printing on my laptop. There was literally nothing else to do. Windows 10 seamlessly recognized the printer and I printed a test page with no problem.I downloaded the hp app onto my iPhone and was able to print a test document without any problem. That was really cool because none of my other computers were ever able to do that.I went to a different part of the house and was able to connect my wife’s Mac to the printer as well, simply by searching for it and adding it.The test pages I printed were laser perfect, as expected. They printed after a few seconds, there was no long wait.When idle, the printer enters power saving mode after about a minute. It goes completely silent and dark except for the power light. At first I thought there may be a problem, but no. It wakes instantly when called back into service.I did not try to set up the fax function (does anyone still use that?), so I can’t comment on how that would have gone. Nor did I try to scan or copy anything.As I said, this is a preliminary review. I will update it as I become more familiar with its features, like scanning and copying, and how it works over the long haul.",1,2

Until now. It may or may not be associated with the fact that I refused to allow HP to blatantly collect data. It appeared that the software I got was somehow dumbed down by my refusal to check their box, and uncheck the permission box on a separate page. I installed twice to make sure that what I thought was happening actually happened. When I unchecked the data collection box it installed the basic package instead of the full package. And that's fine. I prefer not to have my data collected. That said, the software at that point was really unfortunate and I need great scanning software, rendering this model unusable for me.Even if I'm wrong, the software was so crippled - straight from their website (full package) - that it was essentially useless for scanning and the results were absolutely awful. You couldn't get more than 300ppi for any type of scan though 1200ppi was boasted. To be honest, it was a real disappointment since I loved all my previous HP MFCs. I was a long-time HP user.I decided to go with the big Brother of the Brother laser printer I bought that wouldn't stay connected. I'm hoping the upgraded model will not have the same issue. For some reason Amazon doesn't sell the model I chose and that was another disappointment. I prefer to buy from Amazon for all the reasons you already know.",-1,-2

I researched printers for a month and decided on this one. The print quality is very good. The replacement toner cartridges are ridiculously expensive. The biggest issue I have is with this SOUND. Turn your volume on when you watch the video. This is the printer calibrating. It just does this randomly every couple of days and lasts for a couple of minutes. And it also sounds like this when you print or copy, but not when you scan. It's AWFUL. If I'm on the phone I can't use the printer because the sound is so loud it makes a conversation impossible.Essentially, I wish I chose a different one and because of the noise this makes I feel two stars is generous.

I scan large volumes. This issue appears to be a known one as the forum is full of complaints.  I've had tech support out twice to replace the roller.  The first replacement improved but did not resolve the issue.  Every scan still has a skew to it.  You have to manually edit every page if you want something to look straight.  It also messes with the scale of the scan - downsizing it significantly.  I was told that the best I could do is to try to find a scan software that could correct it.  For what I paid for this unit I am not happy.  I won't be purchasing an HP printer again.,-1,-2

Quality of print is great.  Speed is acceptable though it bogs down with complex jobs.  Paper handling is solid.  Networking and configuration are good.  And all of this seems to be at a reasonable price... so long as you never have to replace the printer toner cartridges.  Be prepared to shell out at least $450 for HP cartridges.  There are after market cartridges but those require that you pluck the proprietary chips out of the HP cartridges to use them and even then you will see errors on the printer.  I've been a long time HP consumer but that ended with this model.  No excuses for the cartridge pricing.,1,-1

After spending hours trying to troubleshoot why my Windows 10 PCs won't connect to this printer and more than an hour with HP's online support technician, I was ultimately able to connect for printing with a universal HP print driver, not the included driver package. However, the unit still won't scan to PCs on my network. I was told by HP support that there is no fix for that right now (When? ""It's been a while""). What's the point of selling a multifunction machine that can't print or scan with the provided drivers, if at all?

Hawks,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024",2,"I started in IT before laser printers were invented and before HP even made printers. When they came out with their initial laser printers, they were the workhorses of the industry and their printers were built like their calculators - tanks. But even then, there were always driver and/or functionality issues. Later in life, after HP had somehow established itself as the defacto standard in laser printers, I headed up a large IT department and HP somehow always convinced us to go with their products. My support team certainly had way more than their share of help desk triage calls to go deal with dysfunctional HP printers. You'd think I'd have learned over the years to avoid these continuously worsening pieces of technological disasters, but no... I have made the mistake several times of purchasing and installing HP printers in my home & office.Now having owned and attempted to regularly use a Color Laserjet MFP M479fdw AIO for a couple of years, it has become my proverbial last straw with HP printers, and most likely ANYTHING HP. This printer has always/continuously had some sort of issue, since day one. These days, it stops working not daily, but literally hourly or less. It is constantly going offline, printing errantly if online, and/or suddenly out of nowhere waking up and printing a document you gave up on hours or days prior, even if you deleted it out of the source's print queue. These machines come haunted from the factory. And the drivers/files are HUGE 470MB just for the printer driver alone on a Mac. IIRC, larger on my Windows PC. It's got a scanner, so add another 190MB for that too - and that's just the install file size. Once it's done installing, it actually takes up far MORE space on your drive.Oh, and HP's replacement cartridge strategy of: when it runs out of toner, we're going to charge you so much to replace the cartridges that you can literally buy a new printer for less, so go do that - is completely unacceptable (which I have fallen for a few times with HP color lasers - what a ridiculously wasteful and environmentally disrespectful approach to printing - SHAME ON YOU HP!) And several times, when we've purchased new HP cartridges, taken them out of the original HP boxes and installed them into this printer, it throws an error stating that the cartridges aren't HP OEM and it will not use them/print at all.Oh, and no Internet connection? Then no printing. It doesn't matter if you elect to go with their online account, or print drivers or print controlling or not, the printer still insists on having an active Internet connection (what kind of data are HP collecting without our knowledge??) before becoming functional.After 40+ years, I'm finally done. I have raged, complained, and dealt with their worst-on-the-planet (lack of) customer service, etc. for the last time. If you call them, they will tell you they cannot help you, and then attempt to upsell you on something, like support or an extended warranty - even if the product you're calling on IS still under warranty. Absurd!Ironically, I still have and love (even though I hardly ever use them anymore) my old engineering, finance, and computer programming HP calculators, and they are still phenomenal. What happened to those days and that company??If you are considering this (or any) HP printer, do yourself a favor and stop the possibility of being driven insane by a device that will work intermittently at best, have drivers that are always a royal pain to install and use (AND don't work/install most of the time), and buy a brand other than HP. What once, long, LONG ago was a halfway decent printing solution company has turned into a money grabbing, unreliable, torture device manufacturer with no support. PLEASE don't do it. You'll be kicking yourself and regretting it (like me) if you do.",-2,-2

I've owned many laserjets in my business over the years and they've always been workhorses. But not this one. Even before it failed it has constant problems of going offline and had to be rebooted often. To make matters worse, I called HP support to get a repair center, and all the repair centers in my area didn't repair laserjets. I would have to mail it off to somewhere. By the time I packaged it, mailed it away and waited for it to be repaired, and being without a printer during this time, it was just cheaper to buy a new printer (not a laserjet this time). Overall printing costs came out to 14 cents a page, not including toner cartridges, which is pretty high.",-2,-2

Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021",3,"I have had a lot of printers over the years (IBM, Epson, HP, Canon, Lexmark, etc.), and had kind of gone away from HP a bit due to their software/driver problems (when they off-shored the development/support, the quality slipped quite a bit).  However, when printing Christmas cards, my Canon died, and I had been impressed with this HP model when I was helping my sister sort out hers, so I bought one (MFP M479fdw).  Software seems to work reliably so far, so I think HP has addressed that somewhat, granted it is a bit rough and crude in places, but it works.  And it works from both Windows 10 and macOS 11 (Big Sur), as well as from mobile (iOS).  The printer hardware seems to be very good, output arrives quite fast.  One of the problems you run into with cheaper printers (including some lower end HPs) is that they do not put much horsepower into the printer CPUs, and cost-reduce the hardware to the point that they are slow and do not hold up, but this version seems well designed and made.  Ratings from PC Magazine, Wirecutter, etc. generally have this printer at or towards the top, I would say that is accurate.  Print quality on text is excellent, graphics from web pages and similar also excellent, scans are very good (a custom flat-bed would be a tad better, but this is for an all-in-one amongst the best I have seen).  For printing high-quality pictures, you probably still want a Canon or Epson InkJet printer, but this one prints OK for a laser.  HP does not ship this printer with full duty cycle cartridges, but the ones they ship with will still do a decent number of pages.  Control screen is touch and good sized, gets the job done.  Unit is fairly heavy and large, so if you are using this on a desk, check the dimensions some.  The printer is not cheap, but it has excellent print quality and appears to be very well built, so HP has come back to where it once was, at the top.",1,2

This printer is not cheap; however, it is already starting to pay itself off on reduced inkjet costs.  Full review below!Setup:The printer was very easy to set up for computers and from phones/tablets.  The HP Smart App was very user friendly and I experienced no issues getting it set up in just a few minutes.Speed:The printer is extremely fast at warming up and printing.  It is at least twice as fast as the inkjet I was using that was only a few years old.  Two sided printing for less paper use is very speedy as well.Print Quality:The printer has a variety of print quality settings, none of which you will use regularly.  The standard setting is fantastic for office level print quality.  For the occasional picture or flyer, it does a fantastic job on the print quality.Scanning:Openly admit that one of the features I had to have was 2 sided scanning.  Why have a printer that can print on two sides if you can't scan on both sides!?  This has just helped cut my paper consumption considerably.Toner:Toner lasts much much longer than any inkjet cartridge.  This is such a benefit to the environment if you look at your waste stream per page.  The toners from my purchase are still going strong after 428 sheets.  I was going through an XL HP 62 cartridge every week prior to this purchase.",1,2

And HP has been in the forefront of development of laser printing technology, with literally dozens of models for home/business applications.  This model is a good example of their desktop line of lasers.  Remarkably svelte for what it does (although it does weigh over 50 pounds) - ten years ago this type of printer would have been on wheels, with it's own room and IT staff.  And it does everything - automatic duplex printing, scanning and copying, fax with a phone bypass, 28 ppm output, monochrome or full color (and HP has some of the best color profiles in the business), multiple paper weights (HP has a full line of light and heavy weight plain and photo laser papers), finishes and input options (accessories available for tray expansion up to 550 sheets) - truly business-friendly.  It's a do-everything laser printer.  Setup was relatively easy (more below), the built-in LED screen is fast and intuitive, with a galaxy of setup/input options), and it's fairly quiet for a laser.  Monochrome text is crisp and high resolution, and even larger (8x10) photos print at an acceptable 600x600 dpi with perfect color matching.  Not bad.It's also economical, in spite of the Bentley cost of laser toner cartridges - standard replacements are north of $100 each, and a full set (4) of high-yield cartridges will set you back, shipping and tax, on the near side of $1,000 - the standard toner cartridges are good for over 2,000 pages, and high-yield around 6,000.  As a comparison, a standard business inkjet cartridge ($40) will yield 300-400 pages realistically, between clearing dry cartridges and cleaning printer heads, for a best cost of about .10 per page (it can get worse, because you may need to toss out cartridges that have dried out and are unusable - if you print full color brochures or photos with your inkjet infrequently you may pay over .25 per page).  A high yield toner cartridge ($230+) will yield 6,000 pages, for a best cost of .04 per page (standard cartridges will cost per page about the same).  For high volume business printing, your finance department will tell you it's a no-brainer.  For home use, toner cartridges are pricey, but will require no maintenance, can be left in the printer unused for weeks and will still print perfectly, and will yield the full rated number of pages.  The only thing a laser won't do compared to an inkjet is print large format, high resolution photos on graphic arts photo paper - for this you need a dedicated inkjet, warts and all.As far as the setup mentioned above, my first printer arrived DOA - two screens into the setup the onboard LED read ""Printer Failure.""  HP online support seemed to be under the impression I had a different printer, and continually provided instructions that didn't apply to this printer, so ultimately we declared the printer bricked.  Amazon shipped out a new printer ASAP, which went through the setup perfectly.  Could be shipping - HP laser printers don't like their innards shaken- or could be a manufacturing defect.  Stuff happens.  I should also mention that HP printer construction is not quite as robust as some rivals - thinner plastic and hinges, more movable bits - but overall fine for light business or home use, and does come with onsite support from HP for a time.  If you're a small business, this printer does everything you need, economically, with HP's expansive universal support network available.  If you're currently a home user with an inkjet on your desk, you might take a longer look at this one if you're thinking of the switch to lasers - long-term, it will serve you as well, with less fiddling and maintenance, and even though supplies are costlier on the front end, it really is no more expensive and likely even cheaper for general printing needs, with faster and better output.

This replaces an old inkjet printer and there is absolutely no comparison.  Making the change to a laser printer was well worth the investment.The colors are vivid, crisp, and clear.  And, purple actually prints PURPLE!  I compare this to the inkjet and laser printers I use at work.  Purple prints as a weird bluish-purple.  It has an automatic sleep mode.  And, it's very quiet when it prints.  So much so that there have been times I sat there waiting for it to print, only to realize it already did!You can copy and scan with this machine as well.  Both features are very easy to use.  A very convenient feature is the USB port on the front of the printer.  This allows you to (1) print documents off a flash drive and (2) save scanned documents onto the flash drive.  There also a fax feature, but I haven't used it.While this is not deemed a photo printer, I did use it to make my 2019 Christmas cards on cover stock paper (which a little thinner than card stock).  No problems printing on the thicker paper.  And, the photos printed completely to my satisfaction.I would definitely buy this again.",2,2

I am so glad I did that in buying this printer.It was an easy setup, has great quality and very easy to print from even my iPad, which has made all the printing/scanning requirements for work and home well with the price.  Although it has multiple print cartridges and they are more costly, the print cartridges are holding up well.  Plus, I found if you buy recharged cartridges available on Amazon, you can save a lot of money.I have had various printers for home over the past 30 years, and this was the right choice today while working from home and well worth a few hundred dollars more in price.  I have been around long enough to remember when printers like this were thousands of dollars and were not as dependable, which I know goes hand-in-hand with tech advances, however, even taking that into account, this is a good price to quality/function printer.I hope it fits your needs as much as it did mine in the world we live in today and probably will until the end of 2021.",2,2

Does not wake up for maintenance. - Supports a lot of protocols for printing to the printer (IPP/IPPS, AirPrint, some stuff through HP apps, Google Cloud Print, LDP, and a few more). - Thankfully allows for moderately complex setup of networking (can change hostname, configure/manage IPv4 and IPv6 networking, NTP time sync, etc.). - Wireless connectivity works as advertised. Did not try printing with a direct wireless connection, Bluetooth, or Ethernet (although options for managing all of those exist in the administration pages). - Printing works as expected. Seeing that this is my first laser printer, it is significantly faster than any inkjet I've printed. It doesn't take particularly long to warm up. Color printing of photos works well, although they seem a bit dark compared to a calibrated display (could also be the lighting in the rooms I was looking at wasn't the brightest). Details are sharp, and I'm honestly surprised at the quality. I'm not seeing any artifacting, really. I would still print photos with some other device (say, at Walmart or CVS or Walgreens using a dedicated photo kiosk) to conserve color toner (plus it'll likely be better), but this printer looks to be good for general purpose color printing.The meh: - Support was prompt, but had me follow a pretty basic script to diagnose issues with the scanner. They were unable to fix my issues, and told me to get a replacement unit from Amazon, which I did. The fact that I had to get a new unit was an annoyance, and looking at all of the forums online, it looks like ADF issues with HP printers are very frequent. Either HP sells way more printers than everyone else combined, or HP has a quality control issue when it comes to ADFs. - Installation software for Windows is slow and sluggish (and hung once for me). I expect some of that is downloading a whole swath of archives, but it also hung for about 20 minutes trying to set up faxing (I think, the UI was glitching) even though I didn't need to set that up. The second time I went through the setup the software didn't hang, although sometimes it looked like it did. It went much faster.The bad: - Bug in the web server: if the password for the email account one is going to use to send notifications has an ampersand (&) in it, the web server or whatever service the printer has escapes ""&"" to ""& amp"" (without the space, Amazon seems to be filtering out the & HTML code) (e.g. ""abc&123"" becomes ""abc& amp123""), which obviously causes SMTP authentication to fail. Since the internal software for the printer is closed source, there is nothing I could do to fix that. This is something that HP will have to address. - For my original printer, ADF scanning was tilted/skewed, which seems to be a common problem. Seeing that I specifically bought this printer for its ADF (otherwise I would have picked a Brother with better reviews for a color laser printer), this was a deal breaker for me. I followed instructions from HP support to clean the (brand new) ADF sheet feeder rollers, and to adjust the paper binders of the ADF, to no avail. They told me to send the printer back for a replacement, which I received. The very first thing I tested was the ADF alignment, since if that was bad I was just going to request a full refund and just buy a printer from a different manufacturer. Lucky for HP (for now), this ADF seems to work better.- This second printer developed a squeak when feeding paper through the system. HP support thinks is the toner/drum, but I tested removing one at a time to no avail, and the drum is very securely held in the system so I did not remove it (requires removing parts of the casing and unscrewing some elements and manually disconnecting a bunch of small wires). HP support did send a technician to look at it, and they replaced the power board, which changed the squeaking/chirping noise slightly, but it was still there. The first printer did not have this. In the end, I returned the second printer to Amazon for a refund. -- I did notice something about the ADF which seems like a design flaw, and might be the cause of all of the mis-alignment complaints that plague a lot of HP ADFs. Well, really two things, but related: 1. There is only one motorized wheel in the middle of the ADF to move papers through the ADF for scanning, and 2. it seems like this roller sticks out a tiny amount from where the paper rests in the ADF, so if the paper guides aren't set properly, the paper, once pushed into the ADF securely, will most likely lean to one side or another, likely leading to the skew or tilt I saw with the other printer. The paper guides must be set pretty much perfectly (tall order) to prevent this skew. I noticed this with my current printer, but I took a lot more care to make sure the paper guides were pretty much perfect to prevent the paper from tilting inside the ADF. The way to do this (or at least how I did it) is to take a stack of papers, place the papers on the ADF but don't push them all the way in (so the stack doesn't swivel around the wheel), make sure they stay as much as in a stack as possible, and now adjust the paper guides around this stack (the way I did this was over-adjusting the guides so the papers bent a little, then holding the guides with one hand and pushing the paper flat with the other slowly, so that the guides were slowly pushed to the perfect size). So long as nothing touches the guides after this adjustment (and one doesn't get a defective ADF), there should be next to no tilt or skew.I've taken a few pictures of the print quality report the printer took. The first picture is one of both the original (on the left), and the copied one, read in from the ADF. Notice the lack of a skew. The second picture is a closeup of the original quality report, and the third picture is the copy of the quality report as scanned through the ADF. One thing to note with the third image is  that it seems that with solid colors, the scan produced some line patterns. Since I haven't played enough with the scanner yet, I don't know if this is a limitation of the scanner, the result of some pre/post-processing to ""clean-up"" the image, or just the quality of the scanner. Looking at the quality of the printer, it's not the printer part that's producing those artifacts.Overall: If you get a printer with a decent ADF, it seems to be a good color laser printer for its price. Some units tend to have a bad ADF, and even with a good printer it looks like the ADF has a design flaw that makes it difficult to line up the pages, but it can be made to work. Printer works as expected and I am pleased at how fast it is, and the web administration is pretty nice. I'm taking one star away for the password bug I mentioned and how finicky the ADF can be, and another for HP's bad QA, otherwise this looks like a capable printer. I would like to see HP design a better ADF for future models, though. I'm sure some people will like the printer, but I just don't want to deal with the possibility of getting another bad one, so I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1,0

It won’t print photos on photo paper, but for most things it works fine. Setup was simple and didn’t require drivers for our Macs and phones. Simple to use AirPrint on it.Duplex scanning is nice and snappy. The sheet feeder works well and I’ve been able to scan hundreds of pages with it. The HP Easy Scan app is okay. I like its ability to save as PDF/A and do text recognition. However, the page straighten feature doesn’t work well. The UI is chunky. And why did they decide to use a nonstandard save file dialog box? Seriously, HP, don’t do that. Your broken dialog box is enough to make not want to use HP Easy Scan at all.Now, the worst thing. This has WiFi built in, but in mine it will periodically forget that it’s on the network. No amount of tweaking the settings helps. I always need to completely reboot it. Lame.",0,0

Still can't get the email to work but can print wireless so that is nice. The print quality is very good and only recently started to have problems with extra lines on the paper and the auto feed often feeds in a little crooked. My biggest con on this printer which is why I rate it a 3 is it runs through cartriges quickly and they run $120 to $170 for color and $90 to $110 for black. If you do high volumn printing this printer will do the job but it will cost you. I'm lucky to get 500 prints out of a full set of cartriges and yes, I reduced the quality to try to save but I need the high quality prints for my business. I'm goign going back to the HP Color LaserJet 3000 for printing and will pay to set up the email and fax features on this one.",0,0

It is REALLY hard to find the menus and figure out how to change them. Everything is digital-menu based (no buttons) and I have searched again and again for, for example, how to change the settings for copying. I think I finally remember how to do it, but it is not at all intuitive.The other problem is that it is just slow. I don't know why, but it sounds like it takes four scan passes just to prepare to print one side of one page (up and back, up and back). And even if you're making multiple copies, it's just not very fast to print them.Also, if you accidentally have it set to make 2-sided copies (see above about trouble changing settings) but you really only want to copy a one-sided document, when it prompts you to enter the second page, there is no way to say ""start printing"" as most printers have (i.e., telling the printer that you don' t have a next page). You have to abort the printing and start over.All that said, as far as I can see the print copies are of good quality. I can't comment on the price of ink or any other aspects. But based on what I have seen so far, I would not recommend this printer.",-1,-2

I purchased this printer two years ago and have been very satisfied with it.  The quality, speed, and ease of use has been very good.  The toner cartridges that came with the new printer lasted almost two years but I made the mistake of purchasing after-market replacement cartridges and they didn't work in my printer, so be careful when purchasing replacement toner cartridges for this printer.  It sounds like an endorsement for HP, but I recommend using only HP toner cartridges.  The reason is because some of the brand ""x"" cartridges(like the ones I bought), don't come with the computer chip necessary to be compatible with this HP printer.The cheap toner cartridges I bought came with instructions on how to remove the computer chip from the empty HP cartridge and insert it into the replacement cartridge.  Easier said then done.  The chips in the HP cartridges were glued in place, and no amount of cutting, or pulling, or pushing would get them out.  I tried removing the chip out of one of the old cartridges and ended up destroying the cartridge, and was still unable to remove the chip that was essentially ""welded"" to the plastic.  I know that paying $120 for each HP replacement cartridge is a lot to swallow($455 if you buy all 4 at the same time like I did), but I think it's the only way to get a compatible toner cartridge.  If you can find a replacement cartridge that has the computer chips built-in then good for you, but I didn't have any luck with that.",0,1

First one seemed to have touble in communicating via the USB to the desktop on Windows 10.  Would say the paper was out to the computer as it printed.  That seemed to settle down, then the printer control screen went white and won't load.  Also didn't want to drop scans back to the computer so had to go the USB route.  Updated to the latest firmware and through HP software at it.  No joy.  So back to HP it goes.Prints excellent.  Love the dual sided scanner that scans both sides simultaneously.  Full duplex printing as well.  Didn't get around to faxing.  A little slower than the 3525dn it replaced.Hopefully the replacement will have less bugs.---------------UPDATE---------------So the 2nd example arrived.  No fuss at all.  Works as it should right out of the box.  Prints great.  It does double sided printing (read another review where someone was using an incorrect driver and only printing on one side). It does two sided scans.  The print quality is excellent.  It is interacting correctly now via USB, and no white out of the touch panel.  If it was a little faster and I didn't start out with a failure on arrival.....she'd get 5.",1,1

I find I use that feature more than I expected to, and having a little screen to control all of its various functions is nice.  It is also compact enough for a home office.I had no trouble getting it to play nicely with both macs and windows computers.  It lives on my wifi network just fine, and the connection is stable.  I could have hard-wired it to the network, but that does not appear to be necessary.  It doesn't waste a lot of power in hibernation, so it is ideal for a smaller office/home office where it will mostly just sit idle, only occasionally being called into service.Like all of these things, the replacement ink cartridges are expensive, and the build quality is meh.  You don't get the feeling of bank vault solidity every time you add paper to this thing.  But it should hold up a few years assuming it gets the kind of moderate use it is designed for.",0,1

I am actually on my third brother but decided to switch because I’m sick and tired of the leaking cartridges.This time I tried the HP and this particular model is super cheap. When you’re coming from a high-quality Brother and you experience this unit, the quality does not compare. But for starters, the paper tray is so flimsy. When I pull out the paper tray, I noticed that one side as lopsided. I am so sorry that I waited until now to open the box, as the return window has closed.Super disappointed!! This printer is so not worth the money!Update 3/4/21I’m changing my review because of the amazing features this printer has.

In a world of declining customer service and long hold times, HP's tech support is head and shoulders above the crowd.

WOW, HP you are killing it.PRO: Prints fast, sharp, color--no complaints.CON: This is a 3-in-1 machine, and the scanner/copier function can be used with one page at a time on the glass or with a built-in document feeder.  The document feeder is a little clumsy and tends to pull documents just a little bit skewed, i.e. not perfectly straight.

Grossberger,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2019",4,"There are many comments about feeder-scanned images being slightly tilted.  This is true.  It surprised me because after all the comments I would have thought they'd have fixed that.I tried several times with HP on the phone to connect wirelessly.  It connected, but each time I turned my computer off and on, at night, I'd have to also turn the printer off and on to get it to connect.  So I just connected it with a USB cable.  It's irritating that that was necessary, but since that was the only real issue with it, it was just less trouble to use the USB cable than sending the printer back and looking for another one.Connected with the USB cable it works well.  Support was attentive, but they told me that it was my network that wasn't letting the printer connect.  Well, everything else connects to my network just fine.  So although they were attentive, and tried several things, the wireless connection just didn't work.",0,-1

Learnt this the hard way. After initial setup, printer status was always “offline”, no matter what I did. It does not print in offline mode and queues up your print jobs. HP Tech Support suggested the customary factory reset but after a few attempts basically told me to return the printer back to Amazon and called it damaged. Not a practical thing to do considering the weight of the printer and the hassle of re-boxing and returning.Once I updated the Windows 10 OS on my desktop and reloaded HP’s software update, everything was back to normal.

I loved almost everything about this printer, but I'm not impressed with the cheap scanner.The scanner feels like a cheap afterthought.  The document feeder jams easily and the LEDs for the feeder failed after only a few months., The flat bed scanner works flawlessly and that's the only one I use.The printer doesn't hold as many sheets as it should (250) and the copies are often twisted.  The flatbed, however is nearly flawless. I have better luck with fewer than 200 sheets of 20 lb HP brand paper.This printer was not made to print photo quality and you need special paper to do that, anyway.  Most inexpensive ink jet printers can handle the photos better.  This is an office printer and the color photos it produces are good enough for a draft, not for publishing.  Having said that, it's excellent with text.The printer is very reliable, well built, responsive, and easy enough to operate.  I have noticed that HP keeps the drivers updated (computer software and printer firmware), which is important because I have owned mine for 5 years and my computer has gone through 4 major upgrades since then.HP software and utilities are disappointing.  The scanner software is integrated into the printer driver on a Mac OS.  The included utilities were not very good.  The flatbed scanner really works well, but it's very hard to figure out how to use the application interface.  HP's customer support was not very helpful or intelligible.  The web site, however, is pretty good, but they keep changing it, so be prepared search through Google to find what you need.My PDF documents used to print out faster.  Something has happened in the last two years that resulted in very slow Postscript printing, which makes me think it needs a lot more memory in the printer.

So far it prints perfectly.  The ADF works fine, including the rare feature of 2-sided scanning without having to flip the page mechanically.  After a bit of a false start, I found that I can manage (and selectively disable) its many options nicely through the web interface. I love that is has features like being able to force it to use only black toner even when receiving color jobs, and that can even be done per user (if you're using authN). We have Macs, iPads, Windows 10, and  Windows 8 systems here. The only one that gave any difficulty with setup was the Win8 and it's flaky anyway.  I appreciate how quickly it starts, prints, and then shuts down -- much quieter than the old printer.CONS: The flatbed scanner works great for single sheets on it, but it's designed horribly for scanning from bound books. It looks like it should work, but cuts off more than an inch from the edge, making it useless.  The little touch screen app is not designed well. Even with small fingers and careful use, it's too easy to hit the wrong thing in some places. It's sufficiently functional but could work better.  If you know anything about how to configure networks and devices, you're better off NOT using the terrible HP app for ""easy setup"".  Like most cheapskate companies these days, its toner cartridges are INSANELY OVERPRICED, and it comes with crappy half-empty ones. But I'm hoping that the fact the cartridges include the drum units will help avoid some of the long-term maintenance problems I had with Brother (see below).Background:I recently bought this to replace the color Brother MFC-9840CDW I suffered with for years. Those Brothers have a great ADF but many serious design flaws in the print mechanisms, the worst being defective (real OEM) toner cartridges that spew toner throughout the machine, even when brand new.",1,1

Between the two the M479fdw is larger, faster, and it is cheaper to run (assuming you are buying genuine HP Toner).  Unless you are actually printing several thousand pages per month and need the speed, or you are a business managing a ton of printers and need some of the 'enterprise' management features, the only benefit of the M479fdw over the M281fdw is that it can do duplex scanning from the document feeder, which means a lot faster scanning of large documents.On the toner side, at least for the time being the M479fdw doesn't have any available 3rd party toner that doesn't involve removing a chip from the existing cartridge.  That is almost as much of a pain as cutting a hole and refilling it yourself.  In contrast, for the M281fdw there does exist 3rd party toner which works pretty well.  The color might be a little different, but if you are that picky on color accuracy you either own tools to calibrate and correct that, or you should be using an inkjet photo printer in the first place.Setup - make sure you download the 'F' driver for the M479fdw not the drivers for the non-Fax model, they are different and do not work quite right.UPDATE:  Like too many devices the wireless on this has an implementation error.  If your wifi uses 2.4G and 5G (dual band or even tri-band) you MUST have different names or this will have connection peoblems.  A fully compliant wifi stack is supposed to actually be able to connect to both at the same time and increase throughput when they have the same name or just move seamlessly between them.  As long as you setup the router correctly for the 10 devices like this that you already have.....works great!",1,1

It was fairly easy to set up the software on the primary PC and then to connect wirelessly with the other laptops. I was able to run bulletins for a church service using the booklet mode and duplex the pages while flipping on the short side. The colors were accurate and the black and white was crisp. I had no wrinkled pages and the duplex project completed rather rapidly. The Printer self cleans during sizable print jobs preventing ink smear and dirty copies. There were a few moments when I was concerned during the setup but these problems seemed to resolve fairly rapidly without me having to struggle. The one feature I had trouble with at first was scanning. This was, however, my issue and not the machine's issue. Once I figured it out, and it wasn't really that challenging.  The first scan was slightly tilted but then again, once I used extra care in placing the document, this didn't happen again. The color scan was even better to view on the monitor screen than in the original. I posted a picture of the scan. It was hard to capture but you can see that the screen image is brighter and clearer than the original. In the photo, the original appears darker than it actually was but the difference is still marked. At this point I can say I have had a good experience with this copier/scanner but it does require the user to pay attention to detail.",0,2

It's a solid machine with good print quality but so far at least one improvement could be made.You can change paper source when copying or faxing because you are offered an option or it auto detects the paper size but the machine does not do this when scanning. When using the feeder, you cannot change or choose paper source option. You will need to go to your computer and/or open the app on your phone to select the paper source.One convenient feature is that you can default to double sided printing from the printer without having to open your .pdf files to select double sided. This is a real time saver if your current printer forces you to open your files before selecting double sided.Includes 29 different languages.Overall, the print quality is excellent and this is a reliable machine so far.

Good,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019",4,"I ordered this HP 479 fdw printer/copier/scanner for regular home use.  We do a fair amount of printing, mainly in black and white, and we also print colored business type cards with photos.  We also do occasional copying and scanning.  This printer handles our needs almost perfectly.  The print quality is great, the printer is not nearly as noisy as some we have owned, and the set-up was pretty quick (my husband is an engineer with lots of computer experience).  Our only complaint is that the feeder doesn't work very well.  The images come out ""tilted.""  So for copying and scanning, we have to lift the lid of the printer and place our original on the glass.  That way, the copied or faxed item comes out nice and straight.  Since we don't do a lot of copying or scanning, we did not try to contact HP to see if this ""tilted"" glitch can be fixed.  The feeder issue is my reason for 4 stars.  Otherwise, this is a great all in one printer!",1,1

Yes, it’s heavy at just over 50 pounds, but considering it has all the functions of a heavy duty “mainframe sized” copier in a large office, it fits nicely at the end of my makeshift office desk (a utility table).  Fast printing, quiet, convenient duplexing, scanning, attractive design with all of the modern technology built in - AirPrint being a huge bonus as some employers prohibit connecting a personal printer to the work laptop.  You can bypass the headaches of dealing with your IT department and just email work documents to your personal email and remotely print on the HP 479 from your iPhone. And set up is a dream!  Easy to follow instructions with a few simple steps.  You will not regret purchasing this unit.

Scan to USB, PC or email for example.  It lets your print from your iphone.  It supports bluetooth AND regular wireless network or ethernet.  You can print remotely from outside of your home.The print speed is amazing.  The printer wakes up and warms up within a few seconds and your prints are ready by the time you walk up to the printer.  The printer when not in use goes to sleep and it seems to not be hogging much energy in sleep mode.As far as print quality, do not expect to get high quality photo prints with this printer.  It works very well for color graphics and regular text, but like any laser printer on the market, you'll want to use an inkjet to print photographs.  It's not this printers fault, its just the technology we have available at the time.Very happy with this purchase!",1,2

I had an Epson inkjet that barely lasted two years and I could not get the heads to print cleanly so I decided to invest in this laser. The hardest thing so far was getting it out of the box. Setup was super simple and connecting it to the WiFi was a breeze. I print from a Windows laptop, my iPhone and my iPad all wirelessly and it works great. Haven't lost the connection in a month. So far I'd say I've printed about 100 pages and zero complaints. I also have the HP Smart application on my laptop and use it to scan wirelessly. Only pain is getting up to go put the pages I'm scanning into the tray as the printer is in another room. But it scans very quickly at the lower resolution - haven't needed to go higher res yet. I think this was a good investment for my home office.",2,2

It prints like an absolute beast, it scans well - only issue I would have is that it can't link up to an internet email account, so @gmail folks will have to scan, save and then send separately.I realize the toner is expensive, but this thing prints like a maniac.

Unless you use the printer to print money you better have a deep pocket!As a small business owner, cannot afford to pay such exuberant amounts for ink cartridge replacement. I also did purchase the cartridges without chips and after spending 4 hours and removing the chip from each HP cartridge and installing them on the after the marker ones, none worked and had to return them.

Print quality is great! We don’t print a lot so I can’t speak about how long the ink lasts. When printing, its not noisy at all for what that’s worth. My one criticism is that you need a land phone line to fax. It won’t fax via Bluetooth or over a digital phone line. Faxing is pretty much obsolete these days but if you ever needed to fax, just know that you will need a phone jack, phone chord, and a land line (not a digital phone set up) to do so. Other than that, great quality printer for the price",1,1

Chat with tech support resulted in tech support person telling me to call my IT department!  I am a home user, I don't have an IT department.  Managed to install it by shutting off Windows Firewall, but it cautioned me this would only work for its existing IP address.  However my router uses DHCP and there is no way to give the printer a static IP address, so I could anticipate having to constantly reinstall it.  During the brief time I did get it working, it printed fine, but I really need scanning to work.  The scanner works OK but I could not get it to automatically save to a file, you have to wait for the scanned document to show up and manually save it.  And you have to manually rotate all the pages, it doesn't do any of that automatically for you.  Also it comes with ReadIris scanning software, but only with a license for 1 computer -- even though you are buying a networked wifi machine for multiple users.  And the kicker; the phone app would scan -- but only one-sided, no way to duplex scan through the phone app.  If you just need a networked laser printer and only occasionally need to scan this might work for you (if you don't have the installation issues I did)...",-1,-1

The printer came with an empty toner cartridge which we thought was the issue, so we ordered a new cartridge and discarded the empty one, like anyone would have.  Even though, Value Rush swears it should have had a brand new toner even though it was ""Factory Refurbished.""  After speaking with someone about this issue and they offered us a $29.99 refund for the toner, but never received the refund.  Yes doesn't nearly cover the cost of the new toner.  Once we received the $217 new toner, we installed it and then attempted to print and the printer still would not work.  So, we requested a refund and sent the printer back and ordered a brand new one from a different company.  Once we received our refund for the returned printer, we noticed the company is charging us a ""re-stocking"" fee of $200 because we did not send back the empty cartridge.  I asked to speak with a manager multiple times and got nowhere.  We are a large company and order lots of devices from Amazon.  Please beware this company name.  That is bad business.",-2,-2

How expensive can it be to add a CD/DVD with the necessary software? Second, the downloaded distributable driver software cannot find the (wired) printer (although I have the internal configuration port open on the same PC I'm trying to install the printer). Somehow on one PC I managed to get a test page printing, and that was it. Printer went off-line while installing the second PC (that failed to communicate entirely). Finally I tried on a third PC the 123.hp.com/laserprinter link (in my own office, not at the client). Guess what, It detects the printer and  then a while later, during the installation, it couldn't find it. Choosing SKIP detection eventually got the thing working. Now I need to go through this process on all 25+ workstations at the customer, who doesn't have really fast internet.I'm a big fan of HP laser printers, but this was the worst and most annoying printer even bought from them.",-2,-2

The HP  Smart App for my Mac Book Pro crashes and is useless while the same App with the phone works. Horrible programmers doing the App. Print cartridges are expensive. My next Laser printer will be from another company other than HP. Its very sloppy with bugs and design flaws.,-1,-2

The profile does not clearly state its monochrome! I had to find it in the fine print after the printer arrived and wouldn’t print color. Why would anyone spend this much on a black and white printer?? AND... the print quality sucks. You can barely see anything if the doc your printing isn’t black and white. Plus the scanner always scans crooked no matter how hard I try. Buyer beware... this printer sucks. Wish I could get my money back but I threw out the packaging because of covid-19. My mistake.

Not great, but OK, until I tried feeding several pages into the scanner. The ADF is incapable of taking ONE sheet at a time. It has no trouble moving 3 or 4, but it simply cannot feed just one.

We have 5 P2055dn Laser Printers which are total workhorses and seem to be unstoppable, but this all - in - one was a total fail. Sorry HP.

I went ahead and bought replacements cartridges online, to have them whenever mine would be empty. That day has come and today, in need of printing documents before christmas, I installed them. Turns out HP has put in the firmware a check to disable any printing attempted without HP cartridges (which they sell for triple the price, for the EXACT same thing).So now, I cannot print my documents even though I have a perfectly functioning printer and cartridges, just because HP decides that their motivation to make indecent margins at my expense is higher than the motivation they have to put me first.Because now, I have wasted money on cartridges, I have to buy a new printer, and I still won't have my documents printed today unless I drive to town and find a place that will print me copies. So all of this will waste me about $500 plus 3 hours of my time at 150 an hour, so HP's policy of being anti-customer has costed me $950.When a company pretends to put customer first and then does that, you know that they have no link between the marketing values and their actual values. How can you ever buy a product from them knowing that any day, they may upload a firmware update that forces you to buy more from them ?",-2,-2

We have had nothing but trouble with this printer. It won't wirelessly print, so you are stuck hooking it up to a computer through a USB cable. The print quality is beyond  horrible...printing parts of images on top of other images from the same page. The customer service is nonexistent, with a computer fielding you to different non-helpful pages on the web. There is no way to really contact HP. They send customers on a wild goose chase on their website and have blocked messages on social media. HP has also commandeered all of the Google searches, so you are unable to locate actual help outside of HP to fix your issues. We spent an obscene amount of your time trying to fix the printer issues and unfortunately were unable to resolve them.  We don't have an alternative printer company, but we will no longer be an HP customers.",-2,-2

Parikh,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2019",2,"Well, when it works it works good.  Prints fast. But there are some connectivity issues between the unit and the I mac.1.  I am having problems printing PDF files and JPEG files.  I get a limitcheck error the document does not print. I get a print out with the error message.  I looked on the HP Community website, and I guess other Mac users are having the same issue.2. Sometimes I print something and I see it's printing in the print dialog box, but it never actually gets printed out.  I don't receive an error message so I don't know what the problem is or where the print job went.3. Having Problems scanning because the scanner does not communicate with the iMac.  I have a photo of the error from my scanning software, and the color screen on the printer stating that the computer and the scanner are not connected.4. Missing Pages--Printed out a six page documents of receipts that need to be paid, but only 5 of 6 pages printed out.  The print job was just killed after page 5 with no error message.  Same thing happened to a three page pdf file, last page never printed.  You need to separately print out each page.5 New error message in the screen 0005FB6.  I have no clue what this means.  My print jobs have disappeard.6. Usually it prints very fast, but with some pdf's it takes a while.  Maybe a minute a page.I am connected with both AirPrint and I also added a USB cable.  The connection seems to just get lost sometimes.  ==> need to unplug and reboot the computer.I purchased this unit because I had the HP 1200 printer around 1990 and it worked great for Years!!!  Never had an issue or jammed.  I really miss her.",-1,-1

I finished sending the envelope info to the printer almost 20 minutes ago and IT  IS  STILL  WORKING  ON  THEM. It prints one envelope every minute or so. Slow to print, so, unbelievably slow.Our other new HP (the 521) does this with print jobs as well.HP either sucks or blows. Whichever it is, I am willing to bet it does it S  L  O  W.Update 16APR2021: The scan function refuses to work now, the printer keeps saying it isn't connected to the computer or the network-- it is and prints fine (but SLOW, if I haven't mentioned that before) but nothing helps them see each other despite this piece of trash scanning fine until... hm, until I posted the first part of this review.Stay away from this ugly paperweight. I wish I could send it back. Or to Hell.DREADFUL DEVICE, USELESS SCANNER, WASTE OF TIME AS A PRINTER (LITERALLY). BUY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS MODEL (and avoid the 521).Update 20OCT21.

Hamilton,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2020",3,"I have no issue with print or build quality however it's hard to believe this design was green-lighted for production, it's as if no one ever tested this under actual usage conditions.  The problem is the documents feeder:  when documents come out into the output tray the design is such that the rear end of the paper doesn't often fall down enough to avoid the front edge of the following document from hitting it, causing a jam in the output tray.  The level of the output tray just isn't low enough to prevent recurring jams, even when putting as little as ten sheets through, whether faxing, scanning, or copying.  Forget about putting more sheets than 10 through, you just can't place the sheets in the feeder and walk away.  You'll have to stand there and nurse the sheets through to prevent jamming, even removing them one at a time as they pass through.  As you can imagine that's a deal-breaker - I wish I never bought this machine because that's a royal pain-in-the-neck.  It's as if they never put the device through its paces before producing it because I can't imagine how they brought this to production with this huge flaw.  If you ever copy, fax, scan more than 10 pages at a time, don't buy this machine.  And the touch screen is really small.",-1,-2

Everything worked fine the first few days.Then, I was unable to scan from the printer. It appeared that the scanner lost wifi connection but not the printer. I did some restarting, rebooting, and reloading of drivers, etc. Got it to work. The next day back to the same problem.I could always scan from the app so all was not lost. Just frustrated at this point. Tried all the included troubleshooting s/w supplied by HP. I was not impressed with the s/w and my problem was still not resolved.Since I can print reliably with good quality and scan using the computer app, I have decided to not return the printer because I am not sure there is anything better out there.

Sleek, easy to operate & install, fast and high quality output.This is a great complement to a color laser that could be used for high output monochrome documents. It's quite a bit faster than our HP color laser and it's nice to have 2 printers on the network.HP has implemented what they call ""Dynamic Security Enabled Printer"" which apparently prevents the use of non genuine HP toner cartridges. The warning states that while non genuine toner cartridges may work, they may not continue to work.I've ALWAYS used generic toner in my HP printers without any issues. If this is how HP is moving forward, I'm going to rethink my brand loyalty.As far as the printer itself, it's fast and the print is crisp and clear. The duplex mode works fine as does the scanner. Operationally I can't say anything negative about the printer.You'll have to decide for yourself if you are OK with being forced to purchase expensive toner.",1,1

Like many households right now we are running home schooling as well as working from home using professional software programs. I purchased this printer because it states that it is a professional printer NOT!  Using it for home school and personal use the HP Smart App works fine. The big issue comes when trying to use with Acrobat DC Pro and Acrobat 8.1 that I use and have used with previous Brother extensively and without issues.  Using this printer if you scan more than one page using these programs and the document feeder it will only render and return the first page even though it actually scans all of the pages in the feeder. Productivity is drastically reduced by having to use a personal (non work-VPN) computer to scan and then email that pdf to my work email then import the document.  It was also a difficult job just getting up the printer for use with my work VPN using our IT department professionals and would not install the Smart App as it requires a login which my work account does not provide or allow while logged in to their VPN. So that leaves my work computer without the ability to scan multi-page documents. Also HP Technical support is elusive and hard to contact!,-1,-2

I have to constantly turn it off and turn it on again to get it to come online. (FYI, it is sitting without eight feet of the router, the Mac is new, and the OS is up-to-date. I must use the trouble-shooter in the HP desktop software 2-3 times per week, and it often tells me a problem has been fixed when it has not. I have complained to HP about this, but they have never gotten back to me. I might be able to get around this problem if I used a direct connection, but we also use it to print from other devices on the network.

I would have rated the MFP excellent but periodically the printer goes offline for no apparent reason.  The HP Smart Software is comprehensive but the downside is you're forced to sign up with HP to get all of the MFP operations fully functional.  The Smart software runs into glitches and when it does prints may be incomplete without any notice on the screen.  More fiddly than prior HP MFP's.  I've an HP customer for 30+ years, when this unit wears out, I may check out the competition to see what else is out there.",0,0

I purchased this one a year or so ago, and it churns out copies or documents faster than you can imagine.  I had an older but excellent Brother printer that needed a new drum (which was a good investment; it still works), but that also lacked a USB port which has become essential for my work. After researching dozens of options, I settled on this HP model.Here's what I love:Literally lives up to the word ""laser"" in its speed. Spits out the work almost before your finger leaves the print button.The touch screen is a great feature, and lets you choose what you want to do with documents you put in the feeder.You can NAME documents you scan to your USB drive!  How cool is that?The USB port is in the FRONT, not hidden in the rear. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to hide those things (especially on black printers) but this one is easy to find. If a manufacturer needs to have a rear port, fine, install two of them.The printer is white, and looks beautiful on its stand. I personally find darker colors depressing in my work area.The printer has all the latest bells & whistles for wi-fi,  etc. I have not used some of the features yet, so I cannot comment on them.Things I'd change:If you replace the toner, you have to replace the drum as well. This  is needlessly expensive and almost kept me from buying the printer (the USB port, its placement in the front of the unit, and the color of the printer were among the deciding factors).The drum and cartridge that came with the unit are still putting out great copies (even though there's an alert that toner is getting low).  I never replace toner until I absolutely have to; I purchased the replacement (high volume) cartridge/drum when I bought the printer, just to have on hand and it's still in its box.  It appears the HP laser printer will produce a lot of good copies with its original toner before you have to invest in the toner unit.The cost of the toner (which requires buying the drum, too) is the reason for only four stars. I'd have rated it 4-1/2 if that option were possible, because I really do love the printer and all its features.",1,1

I’m glad I came across this model. Very easy to set up, I think it was on sale when I bought it so I got it at a great price for everything it does. My 2 gripes that prevent it from being a 5 star review: I wish it was easier to set up emailing docs straight from the scanner, rather then having to contact my company IT department to try and figure it out. I wish it would just mimic an email address it was sending from. Second, I wish the compression on the scans was a little better. At the smallest file size, the quality is still passable, but it’s definitely an obvious reduction in quality. As a busy real estate agent, I’m moving through papers all the time, if I don’t keep the files at lowest compression, the size starts to add up rather quickly. Other than that, a very easy to set up machine, great quality on prints, love it!",1,1

Both both of us have iPad and iPhone.  I am happy to report that this laser jet can be connected automatically through WiFi if you have iPad or iPhone or I am guessing, any other type of tablets or cell phone.  That’s a good thing because I often like to just print stuffs out from either my iPad or iPhone.  I try printing and scanning using my iMax but have not tried the fax since I don’t have any landline number and I don’t think I ever use a fax.  First of all, if you have iMac, it’s hard to find the app that will work with your iMac.  I finally found one that “works” with the latest IOS that I have on my iMac and was given warning that some features might not work with the new upcoming IOS upgrade and it took me a long time to install the app on my iMac.  You don’t really need to install the app unless you want to use the scanner, for example, with the app.  I found scanning and sending the result to email address is really cumbersome.  But you have the options to also save it to USB drive.  I haven’t done any of that either because I know I would never use that feature.  Using the app installed on my iMac, I found the app to scan is really primitive.  The options are very limited and the result (for COLOR photo scanning) is so so.  This is not a printer designed for deep rich photo scanning.  It works well if you just want to scan document.  So my suggestion, if you only have iMac, you might want to purchase this with caution.  But from my experience, most app designed for iMac is never that great.  So, this laser jet is no different than any other printer made by different manufacturers.Installing the app on PC, on the other hand, is really quick.  I am not sure if the app needs to be installed to print from PC.  When I try to print from PC for the first time, the computer automatically installed the app.  It’s almost like plug and play.  It also connects through WiFi, just like it does with the iMac.Now lets talk about the result.  The default setting has the print almost too light.  I haven’t really played with the printer properties, so I am not sure how much changes you can make with the print quality.  But since we basically use the printer for personal use, I don’t mind the default setting.  That way I can prolong the life of the cartridge.My final thought with this printer is it is a decent enough printer for printing.  I am quite happy with the result of the printing.  We have a very fast connection and since we are doing all the printing through WIFI, it will take a few seconds for the device to connect and “wake up” the printer.  But once it’s connected, it prints really fast and very quiet.  I thought nothing was printed the first time I tried it because I didn’t hear anything “rolling” like most printers do.  I didn’t rate this printer as a ‘5’ because of HP doesn’t have any software compatible with iMac and for the price.",1,1

If you scan with a single page on the flatbed scanner, you can get very high quality results, but the fed scanner tops out at 300 dpi and is noticeably low-quality if you blow up the scan on your computer.It's easy to set up on wifi and overall fairly intuitive. The features it does have let you print/scan from basically anything easily and work very well. But now for what I don't like for a printer at this price point:You can't scan a two sided document (and send the file anywhere) from the printer itself or from the HP Smart app that is meant to be used with the printer. I spent several hours on the phone with several different support centers. The first person said it was a bug and to contact software support, then software support said that the missing feature was meant to be missing.There's no reason whatsoever for this feature to be missing. The only way to scan a two sided document and save it to a pdf in any way is from a separate computer. The app and printer will let you scan as many pages as you want one after the other, but it doesn't let you scan both sides (together through the fed scanner).The other issue I had was with the scanner feeder making slightly rotated copies. You can see the offset in the test print I scanned, and as of now there's no way in software to adjust that feeder in particular (or the scanner at all) but there are ways to adjust the printers calibration (but it's been fine). It definitely feels rushed and incomplete, but since it's a brand new printer, it may be.I can't say I wouldn't recommend this printer, since the rotation issue is most likely a defect on my unit, and the two-sided scanning inconsistencies may not impact your workflow (since PC scanning is perfectly normal). If these software issues were fixed, I'd say this deserves 5 stars, but I almost feel a bit generous giving it 4 as it sits.Edit: I definitely gave it 4 stars when I made the review, but after it got posted, it went to 5 stars. Bringing it back down to 4 stars again",1,1

My husband had to carry it in for me and set it up in the office. Installation was normal for any giant printer. A little more complicated than a home printer but not as hard as a big office printer. It does walk you through it step by step pretty much. I do like that it walked you through everything right away so I don’t have to fumble later.The majority of us in the office liked the performance of the PPM. I felt it was kind of a beast. It says it can do 40 PPM. This is average to high for a small office printer. It has an intuitive touchscreen that works phenomenal, double sided printing that you don’t have to feed yourself, and can scan and fax. It is quiet, quick, and does the job. It is heavy and takes up basically a whole desk but for a small business that needs a printer that only prints in black and white I would say this is your printer. I recommend it. It’s been 6 months that we’ve used it every day and still have not needed to order ink. The cost effectiveness is also important.",1,2

Installing the drivers was a breeze. Configuring it to my wifi was even easier. The most difficult part was getting this quite large printer out of the box and onto a desk.I will say that the touch screen wasn't perfect, and left a bit to be desired.All in all, I recommend getting this printer for the bulk of your prints, and maybe a cheaper budget color printer, for the odd-color-job.",1,2

However, never have I had such difficulty getting a printer to stay connected. Over the past six months that I have owned it, I have had to reconnect, reinstall the software and/or drivers, and contact HP support multiple times. I do recommend this product, however, I have some suggestions. DO NOT follow HP's installation instructions. And do not try to install it using HP Smart (first). Go to the downloads page for this printer and only download the single printer driver. At this time (of writing this review), Universal PCL-6 works. Obviously, do this after connecting your printer. I am connecting by Wi-Fi and found that connecting using IP or WPS works. But do not download any of the other software until AFTER you have completed these steps. Then go ahead and download and connect through HP start, download the HP Scan app, Wi-Fi direct if you want, and the HP support app. After multiple, multiple trials and errors, I have found that this is what works. I caution about this because you will get instructions with the printer telling you to go to install a URL to use HP Smart to install the printer. Do not start there. If you follow these instructions, you'll save yourself from the pain I've been through. HP support is good, and they will help if you need it. However, these instructions alone will get you on your way with this device so you can enjoy it. Some features I especially like are double-sided printing, that the envelope print tray actually works well, and that the scan to email and scan to folder options are easy and useful. Accessing the printer's page via 192.168.x.xxxx (whatever is assigned) is also useful (and you can and should set a password to protect this admin. page. You will need to search the menus to find this option, but it is there!). Lots of other nice aspects about this HP printer/scanner. And, If you can afford the color ink, get the color version of this printer. That was too expensive for me, so I got this black-only version. Now that I have it working and know the steps to set it up correctly, it works great for my 1-person :-) business.",1,1

The M428fdw packs a fax, copier, printer and scanner in a compact package. Although the scanner is capable of 24 bit colors, the print engine is strictly black and white. But let's go in order ...Installation is easy as it involves connecting the printer to power and following on-screen instructions as it powers up. The screen is small and if your vision is challenged (or your fingers are above average in size) you may need help to walk thru the first steps. The screen is decent in resolution but pixels are quite noticeable. The touch screen allows for direct selection of function and swiping, but make sure to adjust your expectations to the beginning of smartphones, sort of. However, the screen interaction is minimal as you're simply telling the printer which region and language to provide proper directions to continue in a web browser.The setup  is completely wireless and all you have to do is to be on the same network the printer is supposed to connect to. (It can always be changed though) Once you visit 123.hp.com/laserJet you get to download the driver and control software which includes the fax setup and scanner software. In my case the downloader suggested the full installation.Let's get the odd ball function out of the way by say that the fax is still a serious office feature, but it does require a landline and many home offices may have cut that cord. I was hoping that the network scanner capability possibly translates into an internet based fax solution, but that's not the case with the M428fdw.Speaking of the scanner, the flatbed is rather rudimentry with a fixed solution of 300 dpi and very limited ability to adjust the scan area. However, a nice feature is to directly choose the file format as picture or PDF and the freely downloadable OCR tool to recognize the text in scans. The scan can be started from the computer with a software module that provides slightly more functionality than the basic feature directly accessible via the touch screen.The majority of the work is likely relying on the monochrome laser printer. It's limited to maximal letter sized paper but the 500 page capacity gets demanding documents done. The toner cartridge is larger than most entry level laser printers, but that also reflects in the cost for a refill. The HP58 typically runs $200 for one. Print speed and noise is excellent while also offering double-sided printing.The combination of integrated scanner and printer makes for a natural application as a copier. It's self contained and allows to scan and directly print (both at 300 dpi, but even color scans of course are turned into black and white prints).The M428fdw makes a strong case for a multifuction device as it's a compact combination of scanner, printer and copier, although the archaic seeming fax could have used a modern interpretation instead of the needed landline.",1,1

However, the disadvantages of bubble jet printers were becoming obvious to me. Ink is expensive, they tend to clog up, and if you run out of one ink you often have to replace all of them.  Also, the main thing I want is professional text printing. I never do colour printing, and if I wanted to, you get better and cheaper results from a bureau. Colour copying is possibly something I might have wanted to do, but again I do it so rarely it isn't worth buying a printer just for that. And while inkjets do a surprisingly good job with text, they just can't match the results of a laser printer.  A laser printer seemed more attractive therefore, but until recently they were prohibitively expensive for home use. I saw some cheaper ones, but they generally got terrible reviews. I'm happy to say this one has turned out to be an excellent choice. I wanted to buy an HP because I've always been impressed with their quality. This one is very solid and I have had no trouble with it. It scans in 24 bit colour, which is important for me. I can't attest to the professional specs of the scanning, but it is perfect for my needs. It is dual-band, and it tends to drop off the 2.4 G band. But I think this might be a problem with the router since my AppleTV doesn't like it either. I had initially some trouble with scanning to my PC (it defaults to sending scans as jpeg), but I think I just need more practice. I had a big headache with running the scanning drivers on my laptop - every time I opened the lid I got an error message about it not being able to connect to the scanner service. I found other people complaining about it online to. In the end I just uninstalled the scanner tools. Since many people use laptops exclusively these days it would be good if HP addressed this. It has drivers for Mac and iOS and these are generally good but have a few limitations like not allowing you to specify the paper orientation when printing from some sources. But apart from these driver issues, I think it's been a very successful purchase.",0,1

And never did I ever have any problems with my old reliable LaserJet My office needed a hi-speed LaserJet that could print both letter and legal in the same print job. And my print jobs average 200 pages. So I chose the HP LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw, and purchased the 3rd tray for only legal size paper, while dedicating tray 2 for letter sized paper. And let me tell you, this printer is amazing! I download the file and save it to my computer. Then I open the printer software and print. It's that easy. The printer sees the size of the page to print and pulls from the correct tray every time. This printer is installed via wifi to my computer and the connection speed and print speed is great, no lags at all. I then take the documents to my client's home to get them signed. Then it's back to the office where I use the incredible ""scan to computer"" feature to create 200 page PDFs (of both letter and legal size scans) to email back to the lender. I've run almost 2500 pages through this process since I bought the printer a couple weeks ago. My workflow productivity has increased at least 50%. What a great printer this is! Thanks HP. Get yourself one, you won't ever be disappointed. You just cannot beat the reliability and simplicity of this workhorse.",2,2

They last forever.  There is no goopy ink making messes or clogging lines and print heads.  I go years on a single toner cartridge.  Brother has been my go-to for these for the last 15 years.  Very affordable with great features and quality.  Unfortunately, the new lineups from Brother are not getting the kind of reviews that give me confidence; I saw several red flags around toner lock-in and forced re-supply.HP has always been the leader in printing technology.  They have just been cost-prohibitive for personal use.  The LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw is snappy, smart, good quality, easy setup, and has all the business class features I value while not breaking the bank.  Not super cheap, but I feel like I am getting my money's worth with this printer.I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for low total cost of ownership with best in class printing technology.",1,1

But then I needed to fax, and scan, air-print, and also do all of this en masse. I had about 5 other printers from HP, Brother, Epson, Canon, usually under $250. But I decided that after enough years of being annoyed with running out of ink, manually feeding docs on the flatbed, or having limited feeder options (only for printing, not for scanning), I pulled the trigger on this bad boy and have no regrets. I can fax the world via individual or scheduled (I did a 30 page fax to eFax number for testing), scan (using my computer) with the document feeder (25 pages IN A MINUTE exported to a PDF, compared with 2 hours with HP Scan), super fast air printing with easy WiFi setup (again, like a minute for 20 pages), and I don't have issues with sleep/wake times like I have with previous printers that might lose their IP address (for various reasons, periodic router reboots). This is the printer for you, if you want the kinds of options I did. Enjoy!",2,2

This gem took about 5-7 minutes to initially setup via USB connection, all very simple and self-explanatory.  Printed a test sheet, then went to the touch screen to set up wireless connection.The touch screen looks small and easy to ""fat-finger"", but I never hit a wrong character.  About 2 minutes max on an easy wi-fi setup.  Then I connected three laptop devices, all very simple and self explanatory.

Great printer in a small footprint/package. Recently, we decided to get another for an employee to do ""check runs"" -- not tie up a community printer (nothing worse than someone printing an email on check paper). Imagine my surprise -- I paid $170 on 30-Apr-20 (sold and shipped by the all-mighty AMZ) and now, a little over a year later, holy crap, the same exact printer (sold and shipped by AMZ) costs $300. Wait, WHAT!?!?!? I guess this proves space flight isn't cheap. Anyway, pandemic, supply chain, inflation and tax manipulation aside, it's a KICKAZZ little printer (would expect nothing less from HP). That said, it's not worth $300. Maybe in 10-15 years.",-2,1

I also paid the expensive price for an OEM toner cartridge for this HP. I'm tired of the knockoffs that are not consistent and don't last as long as they say. Highly recommended printer for home or small office.Update:Just after the return window closed, it began doing daily paper jams. I am very disappointed but am stuck with it. Also, the OEM toner cartridge I bought makes a knocking noise for the first 10 or so prints.

When I attempted to clear the error code by following the generic instructions on HP's website. All this accomplished was to remove the error code from the LED screen and leave a blank, white screen on a printer which now does nothing more than keep paper from flying around the office...i.e. it's a 35lb paperweight.  Worst printer I've every purchased (or should I say ""rented"" for a month) before having to throw it into a landfill. Good job, HP!!

Here are the problems so far, and it has only been 2 weeks:I had to print something on legal size, and since then it will only print letter if I press a button on the printer. The problem is you can't just change paper, you have to choose which paper size on the LCD screen also. But it won't let me permanently switch it back to letter. I have to choose letter EVERY time I print from now on. So I have to press the OK button EVERY time. It's so overly complicated, it's ridiculous.The other thing is, it's designed so that you can have paper jams with the end of the paper either sticking out the front or the back. If you have to grab the end of the paper from the front, it's no big deal because you can easily remove the toner cartridge to access it. If you have to grab it from the back, it's a feat of engineering because that's where the electrical components are. You can't remove them to create more space to work. You have only milometers of space to try and grab the end of the paper and pull without tearing it.

It works great this way and I can send it print jobs from any phone or laptop that's connected to my home network. It prints very fast and the prints are decent quality. I've added a couple of stars, since this is probably the set up most people would use these days (still had to buy my own cord, though). Read on for what it's like to have to print directly from a computer:I really don't understand what the deal is with this printer: it specifically says it's not capable of wireless printing yet it doesn't come with a cord. I couldn't even set the printer up and print a test page without it, but luckily I have a little home printer so I brought the cable from it in the next day and was able to at least turn it on and set it up. Ridiculous. Why would a printer not come with the required equipment in order to use it? I hope HP reads these reviews and decides to include the NECESSARY printer cord in future shipments. Seriously, the cord is not optional, you must have one in order to operate this printer because it ONLY prints with a direct wired connection to your computer.After getting the computer connected to the printer, the problems didn't end there. This printer is probably the most problematic I've ever worked with. Nearly every print job I've sent to it has had an error that I needed to spend a lot of time trying to troubleshoot (I actually still don't know how to fix the problem) and every print job has been agonizingly slow to send over (seems really odd for a printer connected via a direct wired connection). The print options are very limited as well. The printing app doesn't allow for some pretty common print options like the ability to center an image. The picture I included is the error I'm getting with nearly every print job which is especially irritating because it doesn't open any diagnostic dialogue boxes or provide any tips or hints on what to do about it. I don't recommend this product.For reference, I'm using this printer in rented office space that doesn't have the ability to connect directly to the network via Ethernet so I'm using this exclusively with a USB printer cord.",0,-1

If you want something to run wirelessly for a small office that doesn’t have Ethernet/ LAN configuration, this isn’t for you. With that said, if you have the proper ecosystem established, this printer is a vertical or tour de force. I have mine configured in my home office running directly to the router hub via Ethernet cable. This would mean that as long as you access the LAN you can send print jobs to the printer.Being a laser printer, it’s blazing fast! The print is crisp and lines are sharp. I use this to print a lot of legal documents and declarations and it’s been holding up incredibly well. It is also very good on toner ( ink) conservation. If you want something suited for small to medium office use or even personal (given the connectivity limitation) I have no problems recommending this. Overall a stout performer at a reasonable price point.",1,2

It changes the narrative on what a laser printer usually means as far as size and weight. Yes it still weighs in at about 18 lbs but that is less than most lasers. And the compact 15"" x 14"" x 8"" size and almost square shape makes for an easy to place printer. I like how all the components and controls are also kept minimal and within the footprint of the printer. I looks nice enough to leave out in plain sight for those with a home office. It is very unobtrusive to have in a public office area as well.I think it is quiet and speedy. It can print out a page in about 2 seconds depending on the graphics and text ratios. It is also relatively quiet compared to most lasers.It has a built-in ethernet jack so you can print from network connected computers and devices. Wireless is not available on this model. You have to get the M404dw if you need wireless capabilities which for the currently $90 price difference is probably worth it to get.The printer is recognized on a Mac OS within the print utility. Great compact form and excellent functioning capabilities. 5 stars.",2,2

It is very simply packaged and does not require a lot of instruction for setup.  You’re instructed to download the hp smart app and follow the onscreen instructions.This does not come with an Ethernet cable for a wired connection, I’m really not sure why his wasn’t included.The printer itself is compact and well built.  I was afraid I was going to end up with this massive monster printer sitting next to my small desk, but it really is the perfect size for a home office.This printer has the capability to print double sided, not really a feature I use often but nice to know it’s there.  The printing is clear and high quality.  It also is surprisingly fast and much more quiet than what I’m used to.  The paper tray is easy to load.This is very important, this is a black and white printer ONLY!! I actually wanted only black and white since I will be printing business documents, contracts and things of that nature.  There is a color model available but it costs more.The downside to this printer is the cartridges are super pricey.  I hope the one that came with this printer lasts a really long time !",1,1

This requires a wired connection, and does not print in color.  Those are the only 2 drawbacks imo, but I can look past that.  Well, if you count the super expensive toner replacement, that would be a 3rd drawback.With that out of the way, the rest of this is really easy and intuitive to use.  The instructions are easy enough to follow, and setup was a breeze.Prints much faster than what I'm used too, and that is pleasing.  The quality of the print is nice too.  Clean lines, with no smudging.It's a little bit louder than what I'm used too, but still quieter than the larger ones.  Paper moves through smoothly, and I've only had a couple of jams.  Personally, I think the jams were due to some bent corners on the pages.  My kids were in it the other day, stealing some paper from it.Don't buy this for home use.

Not just my art (admittedly my primary use) but for any of my printing needs. No need to run to the local library or printshop any more. The initial ink cartridge came with it. The user's manual states I can get approximately 2,000 prints from each cartridge, give or take depending on light/darkness setting. This printer is made to last, it's space friendly and doesn't take up a lot of space, it's quiet and so many more positive things I could say about it.

It operates and looks the same as my previous printer, but even if it didn't, there wouldn't have been much of a learning curve.  It's simple and straightforward. It has a relatively small footprint. Installation was a breeze. The prints are crisp and clear and it handles mailing (labels and envelopes) quite nicely. I print a couple of hundred pages and about 50 envelopes a day and it powers through it all. It makes some noise, but not so much that it bothers me.  I don't expect a silent printer. The tray is easy to load.  The occasional jams on my previous HP were easy to clear and since this printer is nearly identical I expect they will be too.  But I haven't had any jams for the few weeks I've been using it. And you can't beat getting a great printer at a price like this. I highly recommend this one!",2,2

I'm not the best typist, but the keys are SO temperamental that you have to hit them just right to make them register.This is particularly noticeable on the SHIFT / CTRL keys. - I have had to correct my name countless times b/c it wouldn't capitalize. It also sometimes takes 10-20 attempts to copy/paste with CTRL+C/V; this is very frustrating as many of the apps I use for work don't support right-clicking and I typically need to C/P at least 50 times a day.Finally, I have had it for <3 weeks and it's already breaking down - the SPACEBAR gets stuck and makes a super annoying squeak when pressed.I can't imagine this working for anyone who types regularly. It might be ok if you use it once or twice a week to surf the web, but that's about it.",-1,-2

I had hoped this would be one, but unfortunately the left CTRL keycap pops off if you ""flick"" it (for example, slide your finger off the edge and let the key snap back up).  If I push it back it sounds like it's snapping in place, but it just pops off again.I have barely used this keyboard, too.  Some other issues: it does not support N-key combinations for proper gaming, which may or may not be a problem depending on your use.  It also does not have a backlight, but then again I guess these problems can be expected at this price point.The sad thing is that I DO very much like the typing feel of it (it is pretty close to the feel of Logitech MX keys, which for some reason does not come in TKL version ... and ""compact"" does not count).  If Cherry made this with backlighting and N-key support (and better keycaps), I think they would have a real winner.I am kicking myself too because I normally am adamant about keeping packaging until the return window passes, but for some reason I threw away the stupid box and can't even exchange it for another one even though I am within holiday return.

It it worse than the keyboard I am trying to replace and I will buy another brand ASAP.If I need to select, say, 25 items from a batch, and I hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys to select, no matter how hard I hold them down, lots of copies get propagated. If I then select those copies for deletion, now Ihave 50 copies that I must delete one at a time. This is a deal breaker.Also, it could be my fault that I did not read the advertisement more carefully, but the word ""Cherry"" the name of this product, denotes a mechanical keyboard. I thought I was buying a mechanical keyboard. This is not a mechanical keyboard. Given a broken critical function and deceptive advertising this product/manufacturer gets a big thumbs down.This is a CRAP keyboard that I am now returning to emphasize my one star review. The space bar no longer functions and this keyboard is ready for the trash. Further, the keys are angled at 45 degrees on the side. This means that many times, when I hit the A key, this turns on Cap Lock--a major pain. Do NOT buy this keyboard!",-2,-2

Two computers I use almost constantly, and the keyboard is connected to the computers via switchbox. Another computer I use very occasionally, and the other keyboard I connected directly to it.A few months after I started to use these keyboards, the cable on the keyboard connected to the computer I used constantly started shorting. I'd get the USB disconnect and reconnect sound, then the OS reported that the device I connected was not recognized. Since this one was connected to a USB switchbox, my solution was to press the button on the switch box to cycle to another computer and then back to theone I was using, and the reconnection then allowed the keyboard to be recognized. Eventually, I had to start draping the cable in a specific way for the device to be recognized.Once this got to be too problematic because of the frequency of the shorting problem, I unplugged the keyboard with the cable problem and moved the otherkeyboard to the switchbox. About four months later, this keyboard also developed a short in the cable.So in less than a year, two out of two of this model of keyboard have developed a short in the cable. I have other keyboards which I have used constantly for many years, and none of them had this cable shorting problem.I do not simply put the computer keyboard on a desk and leave it there to use it. Instead, every time I use the keyboard I pick it up from the desk and put it in my lap--I sit in a recliner with keyboard in my lap. I'm sure that this frequent picking up and moving of the keyboard contributed to the shorting problem. But, again, I have been doing this for decades without any of my other keyboards having this problem.If it weren't for this problem with the USB cable, I'd give this keyboard 5 stars.",1,-1

This is one of those keyboards where the keycaps sit just loosely enough that if you brush your fingers over them, they all make light clicking sounds.

I browsed thru hundreds of keyboard images and didn't see a single keyboard that had short space bar such as this keyboard.

It feels somewhat like the keyboard of a old school thinkpad, which is a good thing.The issue I'm having is with some keys, for instance the W key, the key just has to be touched barely to register an input, the weight of your fingertip can set it off, without having to buckle the membrane. This isn't a massive deal, but it is quite annoying sometimes when I'm just resting my fingertips on a key, and it spits out a line of I's or W's.",1,0

For instance, when playing Deep Rock Galactic, a first-person shooter, it wouldn't be unusual to be moving forward and right diagonally (keys W and D), then trying to switch to secondary weapon (key 2). Sadly with this keyboard, in that example, 2 will never register in addition to W/D, so you won't switch weapons until you completely stop moving first. I also encountered other combinations that will cause this input-dropping effect, but that's the only one I can remember off the top of my head.I have 0 other complaints about this keyboard. I like how the keys/switches feel, I like how it has a row of media buttons at the top, the cord is a good length, and it has optional feet for some slight tilt. The left ctrl/win/alt keys are a little weirdly wide, but that doesn't cause any problems. Given how good (in my opinion) the key/switches feel, it's unbeatable value at $25 compared to a ""true"" mechanical keyboard as long as you don't use it for games.(I've been looking for a TKL keyboard I could use for games, and this recent release looked like a great option. I don't like typical ""mechanical"" keyboards since they all have aspects I don't like, like significant pretravel, an activation point _just_after_ the ""snap"" down instead of _during_, tall size and long push distance, loudness, etc. The scissor switches in the keyboard have none of those problems.)",-1,-1

As an author of medical thrillers, I type all day. For anyone who's an experience typist, it's all by feel. The important keys are still in the same position as a larger keyboard, except for the important delete key. So I'm constantly having to look for it. The separate number key area is gone but I've always used the numbers above the letter keys anyways. The other keys are a tiny bit smaller even if in the same position. That does throw me off because my fingers are used to placement and movement between the keys that's a bit different now. Hopefully with time I'll get used to it. However, if I'd realized the keyboard was going to be shortened this much, with slightly tinier keys, I don't think I would have purchased it.",0,-1

Caps+LShift+Tab, or Q, 1, A, Esc will fail to generate all keycodes. This combination works on all basic keyboards we have had without fancy high number rollovers. Works on built in laptop keyboards and stock keyboards from desktop purchases.This was tested confirmed by Cherry support. So stars are given for the quick support responses.(This is not a universal implication of Cherry keyboards. These work fine on a Cherry silent black.

This keyboard fits either a beginner or an expert perfectly well.Zero complaints. It has zero frills and really stands out in a sea of junk.

I do not use the numpad on keyboards so the smaller size was a big plus for me as my mouse pad is on the bigger side. The feel of the switches is excellent and pleasing to type with. It is relatively quiet, but not silent. Good weight and rigidity to the keyboard so it feels premium quality with no flex on regular usage. It is low profile with a tactile feel similar to a laptop keyboard where the key travel (and your fingers moving) is less than most conventional desktop keyboards. It has foldable flaps at the back so you can elevate the keyboard at angle if you so prefer, though I do not use the flaps and prefer the keyboard flat and low profile against the desk.I use it primarily for gaming and typing for programming and documents etc. I have had no issues with it. Another review mentioned that there are issues with not registering multiple key presses while playing certain games. I have not experienced any issues with that myself. On testing, there appears to be about 3-4 keys you can keep pressed down simultaneously after which the keys in the same area will not trigger another keypress. But it seems you can press another key in a different area and it will still register. No doubt there is some technical reason for this but I rarely have to keep 3-4 keys pressed down during games and have not had any issues with this.Overall, I believe this keyboard is excellent value for money and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new TenKeyLess keyboard with a feel more like that of a laptop keyboard.",1,2

The keyswitches are very tactile without being too stiff, and the keyboard is very quiet when typing.  It would be perfect for office use.  The keyboard itself feels very high quality, and had more weight to it than I imagined when I removed it from the box.  The metal plate inside of it makes it feel very stable and planted on the desktop and helps with the typing feel.  The key labels look to be pad-printed, which usually lasts much longer than white laser etching (white letters on black keys) on some keyboards.  Ideally, dye sublimation and double-shot key labels last longer, but I have old logitech keyboards with pad-printed key labels that have lasted many years with no degradation of the key labels at all.  For gaming, I have heard this keyboard  does not allow certain combinations of 3 keys to be pressed at once, but so far in all the gaming I have done, it works fine unless you are used to pressing 4 keys at a time for some commands.  The light indicators for the Caps Lock and Scroll Lock are easy to see but only super bright when looking straight down at the keys.  The typing feel is amazing.  For me it is the perfect level of tactility..very tactile, but in no way is it tiring to type on.  There is no mushiness at all.  I can't believe they are selling this for $25.  It feels more like $50-$80 keyboard to me.  I'm going to buy another one just to have on hand.  The styling of the keyboard is very 'professional'.. meaning.. no fancy RGB or gimmicks, and the metal ""Cherry"" logo at the bottom is a classy touch.  Overall, an excellent TKL keyboard for those that like that Thinkpad-like typing experience but with a higher quality feel to it.  I can type faster than ever on this thing with very few mistakes.  I hope Cherry keeps making these keyboards!",2,2

Compared to K740, here is my summary of the Cherry Stream SX:1. Its keys have more travel than Logitech K740 illuminated keyboard2. The key strokes feel slightly firmer than K740, i.e. the keys are more springy and have more resistance3. It is definitely not as quiet as K7404. It does not have back lights to illuminate the keys in the dark.5. The shortcut keys at the top are not scissor mechanism. As a comparison, all of K740's keys are scissor switch-based.6. It does not have a palm rest like the K740 does.7. The whole keyboard feels plastic dominant. Not sure if the key letters are laser etched onto the caps but time will tell.The verdict:Similar to the phone and computer market right now, the keyboard market is in an innovation desert. There are no decent keyboards with great typing experience. Logitech has rolled out some mediocre keyboards like MX Keys, but made a deadly wrong strategic decision to move almost their entire keyboard product line to battery-powered wireless crap. While doing that, they also ceased production of K740. As a result, the keyboard market is in a dry spell with no end in sight. Cherry's Stream SX is the only decent substitute for K740 for now. Believe me, your office colleagues will want to strangle you if you use a clicky, loud mechanical keyboard in the cubicle.Although it fell short when compared with Logitech K740, it is more laptop-keyboard like compared to Kensington Slim Type Wired Keyboard (K72357USA) and Perixx PERIBOARD-211US, Ultrathin Design Keyboard, as the latter two have keys that are too firm which will quickly lead to typing fatigue.All told, the Cherry Stream SX does deliver decent typing experience, is reasonably quiet, and is corded (this is important because you don't have to buy battery to power the keyboard; besides, wireless keyboards are never secure against prying eyes in the air). It is the only reasonable choice if you want a K740 substitute or a quiet keyboard with decent typing speed.",1,1

The reviews for the Cherry Stream are good, and there are a lot of praises sung for the feel and noise level.I can vouch for this now that I bought one. The unit feels solid, like closing the door on a nice car versus a budget car. It has heft. There are no rattles. It's a very slim keyboard but it doesn't feel cheap.The keys are super quiet and feel great.I use this on Linux (Fedora, Debian, Mint, etc) and the alternate keys work out of the box (volume, mute, web, etc).Overall, this is a really nice keyboard and I would/will buy more Cherry products (unless it dies quickly.)",1,2

The problem with that keyboard was that I made too many typing mistakes because the keys were too close together and smaller. I have no problem with this Cherry keyboard. Typing is just a pleasure. It is very comfortable pressing the buttons, and none of frequent typing errors as the previous keyboard. The keyboard has a good weight, so it does not move around once it is set up. I wish it came with a wrist pad, but that's just a minor gripe.I use a Mac Mini M2, and this Windows keyboard works fine for the most part. The media keys on the top row works without any tweaking. I use BetterTouchTool to reassign keys on the F key row. I use those to launch apps and for common keyboard shortcuts. Only the three keys on the far right side cannot be assigned. The leftmost button on that group (the one with lock icon) works for some reason.I prefer a wired keyboard, so I don't have to change batteries from time to time. The price of this keyboard is reasonable. I could have bought a Logitech keyboard for twenty dollars more, but I think I made a right choice with this one.",1,2

I tried using a mechanical but it didn't have the touch feed back and silent action of this keyboard.  Love the way this feels. this feels like typing on a great laptop i.e an old IBM Think Pad.They improved it with a couple of dedicated keys and LED on the NUM lock and CAPS lock. Also they improved the nubby feel of the plastic finish. Has very stiff legs that elevate it and won't around on you.Best part is I paid the exact same price on Amazon for this that I paid for the old one 9 years ago. $29.,2,2

Has everything except the number key pad which I don't miss because I never use it.  But has the full compliment of cursor up/down/left/right, Page Up/Down, Home/End keys, which I do use.- A bit wider than other compact keyboards, but understandable given that all the keys except the 10-key are there and they are all full size (except the F-Key row at the top, which is normal).  For me the width is just right - it lets me bring the mouse closer by a few inches so I don't have to reach for it.- Keys are pretty nice - Traditional size/shape, medium-short throw, fairly quiet and just loud enough to give some feedback but won't bother others nearby.- Tactile feel of the keys is fine.- Key action is a little bit heavy compared to what I'm used to, but it's reasonable, especially considering the price.  Note: I'm comparing to the original Logitech K800- Like someone else mentioned, I like the weight - feels really sturdy.- Feet are too short for my ergonomics. But I've never found a keyboard that has tall enough feet, so I'm used to making a 2"" stand to prop up the back of the keyboard.",1,1

It feels even slimmer than KC 1000 and doesn't have any issues that my sawed-off version does.Why not 5 stars? Well, my requirements have slightly changed since then. My docking station is running out of USB ports and I'd like to have one wireless receiver for keyboard and mouse to free up ports for webcam, headset, etc. I'm usually not a fan of changing batteries, but modern tech is now good enough so that batteries last about 2-3 years, which I'm fine with.Cherry, please release this in a wireless combo, with a mouse (MC 1100 or MC 2000 would be fine)! If we are talking about a wired keyboard in 2022, then I think it should have a backlighting (as battery life is not a problem).Lastly, there is this extra set of volume/media buttons at the very top, which makes keyboard a little bit taller, than it should be. While I don't need any of those - it doesn't bother me all that much, and actually gives me some extra room to rest my fingers over an F row as I still use them a lot while debugging things.",0,1

I am replacing a Logitech K740 and realized it's hard to find a quiet, slim profile keyboard that isn't also loud (mechanical) or RGB lighted mega-gamer keyboard.This does the trick. I'm not a huge fan of the texture on it, it's like a matte plastic that's also kind of slippery. It didn't take much getting used to in terms of typing so the layout of the keys must be close enough to the K740. Only other nit would be there's no wrist rest, which I didn't think I'd care about, but I liked how the K740 had a slight rest rather than just ending rather abruptly after the spacebar. I really do notice the distance between the keyboard and the desk as I type now, so fiddling with my ergonomics is going to be annoying.As many have noted it's annoying the K740 was discontinued there isn't another board like it today.",1,1

I'm glad to have found the Cherry.The price was reasonable, and I love how quiet it is in an office setting.So why not 5 stars? The space bar is smaller than other similar keyboards. This is a direct result of Ctrl/Win/Alt on the left being a bit larger, but it means that hitting `Alt` is in a slightly different position than what I'm used to. I'm growing used to it.I also believe that 5 stars should be reserved for truly exceptional products.I still recommend this keyboard to anyone who is looking for laptop-style keys and tenkeyless. (Maybe I should buy another in case they decide to stop making it.)(I don't do gaming so I can't comment on chording.)",1,1

Taylor,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023",4,"I needed a white keyboard and was tired of the issues with a wireless one (my mouse is still wireless). The height of the keys above the keyboard is low but not flat (1/32"") and distance between the key surfaces is just under 1/4"".  The keys have a good snap feel with enough sound to confirm you've pressed them--but not loud old fashioned clackity. It doesn't tilt up very steeply but again that's really comfortable for me...and I do a LOT of straight typing. I'd have given it 5 stars but rather than being packaged in a shipping box with packing material surrounding it, the keyboard was shipped in its original box with a UPS label applied and could easily have been damaged during shipment.",1,1

So far I'm liking it.This is currently my daily driver for gaming because I got sick of all the budget ""gamer"" keyboards I've tried that have tall buttons, distractingly dumb RGB out the wazoo, and various quality assurance problems. Haven't had any of those issues with this keyboard.One gripe I do have with this keyboard though is the left CTRL, Windows, and ALT keys are unusually big and the spacebar is shortened because of it. Why could they match the size of the similar right side keys and make the spacebar longer?",1,1

Since this was on sale, the price is great.  I'm not sure I would have paid full price though as this keyboard does lack some features that might be expected in a more expensive keyboard.  I was reassured by the Cherry brand on this one because I know they are world renowned for the mechanical switches used in Mechanical keyboards.  Overall the keyboard feels nice.  The low profile keys are pretty similar to a laptop keyboard rather than a traditional desktop keyboard.  At this price it is obviously not a ""mechanical"" keyboard, and probably relies on a membrane however.They key layout on this appears to be standard.  By that I mean that it doesn't appear to have any funky shaped or sized keys that are in the wrong places.  Some manufacturers seem to think it's a great idea to rearrange the layout a little...looking at you M$oft.  This makes transitioning to a new keyboard or using multiple keyboards intermittently very frustrating.  I will not buy keyboards that have funky keys.The flip out feet are of a typical design, one that unfortunately can result in broken feet if you are abusive.  We've all probably had a one legged keyboard at one point in our lives.The weight of they keyboard is good, thanks to the metal plate.  Along with the rubber feet, you should have no problems with the keyboard creeping around.Many reviewers noted that the received the incorrect language version.  Mine was fortunately the correct US English layout.It's important to note that this is NOT a good gaming keyboard.  It lacks any backlighting for one thing.  I personally don't like to sit in a well lit room when I'm playing games.  It is also plagued with ""ghosting"" issues, which for a regular user in a home or office will probably not be noticed.  If you're a gamer however you might notice that holding certain keys down will prevent other keys from working.  Example: holding down SHIFT, W, D...you will be unable to press R.  Never mind that it might be physically difficult to do so anyway...you might be some kind of 6 fingered super dexterous gamer.  There are plenty of inexpensive, backlit membrane keyboards that have less ghosting issues.Gaming aside, if you just need a good quality, compact, low-profile keyboard for typing in well lit environments then this one isn't bad at all.  I'm giving this a full 5 stars because they say right in the product description that it's ideal for office and industrial use.",0,1

I wanted chiclet keys with some heft while still maintaining that small form factor as my desk isn’t massive.This keyboard weighs a little less than a pound but is very heavy for its size. Its stays put and the keys are made of solid material. The cord is braided and has a cool slight reddish coloring to it. The USB connection is made of solid molded plastic and the cord is long and seems like it would last a long time. It doesn’t have any RGB or back lighting which is exactly what I wanted.,1,2

I think all of them came free with one or another computer purchase I've made over the years.  They did their job, and I was happy.  Well, turns out I didn't know better.My keyboard started to fail.  Went to my shelf, and wasn't really happy with the ones I had there.  My current keyboard had some shortcut keys - caluclator, media control, volume.  And none of the spare had this.  So I thought, hey, I'll look on Amazon....So glad I did!!! The feel of this keyboard makes typing a pleasure!  Not sure I can explain to do it justice - you might have to try it to understand, but press on a key and there's resistance, then as you get near the bottom, the resistance lessens.  It does make some faint noises as I type, but very soft, and not at all bothersome.Plus it has all the shortcut keys I wanted, and adds a few extras.  Also, instead of a section of the keyboard with the three lights (Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock), this keyboard has those light simply embedded in the buttons.  So the Caps Lock has a little light on the button itself to show you that Caps Lock is on.  Feels very classy.Like most keyboards, it has feet you can snap out to give it a bit of an angle.  But even with the feet snapped out, it is still low enough to go under my keyboard ledge (1.5"").  Every other keyboard I've had, with the feet out, has been too tall to go under the ledge.I may even buy a couple of extras now, just in case they discontinue this model or something.  I love it!!!",1,2

So first I'll mention that I'm coming from pretty typical gaming keyboards like the original Razer Black Widow Tournament Edition TKL and more recently after my E key stopped working entirely, the Logitech G413 SE TKL. So after 10 years of gaming with a typical gaming keyboard with mechanical switches. This took some getting used to. But I'm glad I did. I don't have the money just yet to build my self a custom silent mechanical keyboard, so I started searching. I could not find anything even close to my budget that is silent. after hours and hours of searching for a TKL silent keyboard I found this. For $25 I said ""what the heck I'll try it"". After doing some reading I found out this keyboard will not register certain key combinations at once. I have not have this issue as I mostly play FPS games and don't need to do crazy key press combos. If you play FPS games, you should be good here. This keyboard has a very low profile, which I knew about before purchasing but I was not prepared for how utterly flat the key caps would be. It's been a couple weeks now and I'm no longer making any mistakes in game with accidental key presses. The key caps I'm used to have a very curved top that my fingers rest in comfortably. It's basically as a flat as a laptop keyboard. The scissor switches have a very nice ""pop"" to them when pressed, so you definitely know when you are actuating a key. They have a nice feeling. For $25 you can not go wrong here. These switches are as quiet as you cant get without building a custom board. My wife sleeps behind me, her ears are roughly 10 feet behind where I play and she doesn't hear them at all. My mouse clicks are significantly louder than my keyboard now. ( face palm ) This keyboard can't be considered ""ergonomic"" what so ever for gamers. For very casual gamers maybe. hardcore gamers like me. No. I will say though for $25 I don't think there is any keyboard better than this if you are looking for a quiet keyboard ( and I mean VERY quiet ). I hope this helps any of you gamers out there that are looking for a quiet budget keyboard so you can enjoy your game sessions at night without bothering anyone! Happy gaming everyone!",1,1

This keyboard is the closest I've found, and for the price I can't imagine finding anything better.Here are the reasons you need to consider this keyboard:1. The action of the keys. Read the other reviews. These keys have just the perfect touch & feel.2. The keys are quiet. After banking away on cheap keyboards, there is no comparison.3. No latency. That's why I chose the wired model. I'm sure there must be some wireless keyboards that have solved the latency problem, but I haven't found them. I type fast - sometimes over 100 wpm. No issues with this keyboard. No rollover, no missed keystrokes, no duplicate keystrokes.4. The Caps Lock LED is IN THE CAPS LOCK KEY! This is how my laptop keyboard worked, and is a must have feature. No more hunting for some obscure, tiny led - if there is one at all.The only minor issue I have with the keyboard is that it is not a ""chicklet"" style. The keys are beveled and the top surface area of the keys is smaller than a chicklet equivalent. This means I have to be a bit more diligent to make sure my fingers are centered on the keys. An equivalent keyboard, with chicklet keys, would be the ultimate killer keyboard.I bought this Cherry on sale for $20 (it's the compact model without the number pad.) But at even twice that price it is difficult to understand how they can offer such a quality keyboard for the money.If you need a quality external keyboard, don't hesitate. This is the one.",1,2

At first I was frustrated to see that I received what looked like the wrong keyboard based on the image on the box. Out of desperation to get rid of the keyboard supplied by my employer, I decided to take a chance and open the box to see what was really inside. To my pleasant surprise, I find a QWERTY keyboard with the added € sign as indicated on the box. So the box was misleading in this case. The seller/Amazon needs to be more mindful of how their products are advertised. I’m sure there are people who have retuned theirs thinking they received the wrong one when in fact they didn’t; the box is just labeled wrong. I’ve kept the keyboard and am currently using it. I’ve only used it for a day so it’s way too early to tell if it’s going to last but I doubt it won’t. I have a Cherry mechanical keyboard that I’ve used for over a year without any technical or mechanical issues. I was aiming to get a keyboard that’s as quiet as my laptop’s for work purposes and this one is pretty close to that.I have posted a picture of what I thought I received and what I actually received as well as a video showing how loud this keyboard is compared to my laptop’s. I recorded the video with all the noisy appliances in my vicinity turned off; however, there is some background noise because of the cars/trucks driving by. I also tend to press on the keys a little aggressively so if you’re a person with feather-light fingers that simply boops the keys to type, the noise would be considerably less.",-1,1

Yes, this is the next version of those. Yes the keys feel great. It's a bit closer to the second model of ultrax (a bit more force needed to press the button - initially), but I'm sure with time I'll wear those down a bit and make them work like ultrax v1. ;-) As a flat ultrax lover, I never found a better keyboard, until now. Not only we get a TKL version, but this boy is so thin, and quiet... And has the perfect weight. A bit heavier than ultrax I believe, does not feel like a flimsy $10 keyboard. I've tried numerous mechanical low-profile keyboards and they all had something that just didn't feel right. Either the key travel or the actuation force never clicked (ha ha) with me. Cherry Stream feels like typing on those old IBM/Lenovo keyboards, where the designer paid more attention to the typing comfort than how they looked (not saying they looked bad, though). I stashed around 8-10 other keyboards after getting this one, just because the typing comfort tops them all easily.If you're thinking I've said the same thing too many times, you're right, but that's just because I love typing on this keyboard, it's simply a pleasure. I could produce more clone/nonsense sentences, just to enjoy the experience of typing on this GOOD BOY.I love that keyboard. I hope they never stop making them. Personally I believe no other keyboard comes close to how right they got the feel on this one. Thank you so much.IMPORTANT EDIT: this is NOT a gaming keyboard, though. it registers up to three keys pressed at the same time, but if you need 4+ more, it just wont work. Best typing keyboard, not necessarily the best gaming keyboard, depending on your game.",1,2

Brown,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2023",5,"Update September 2024: I have been using this keyboard since January 2023 and it has been working great.  Like the other reviewers who mentioned that their keys stick, similar experience happened to me UNTIL I thoroughly cleaned my keyboard of debris, especially under each key.  In addition, I found out that I can remove keys carefully to clean and pop the keys back again (carefully pop back in).  When I regularly clean my keyboard, the issues of keys sticking is completely eliminated.  My keyboard has not failed again either due to me cleaning it often.The Cherry Stream Keyboard is AWESOME!  I have been looking for high quality keyboards for quite a while now since my favorite keyboard from Logitech is discontinued.  I loved the Logitech K740 Illuminated Keyboards since 2010 and gone through several since then.  Logitech not only discontinued this line of keyboards but the quality has significantly declined since I bought my first one back in 2010.  I no longer trust the quality of their keyboards and will only buy their mice.My fingers are quite small and most keyboards are not touch sensitive enough for me.  Many need quite a lot of pressure or ""pounding"" of fingers to register letters on my monitor.  Eventually, my wrists and fingers would ache since I type A LOT for both working at home and for personal use.  This keyboard ROCKS!  This is the best keyboard I have ever used since my first Logitech K740 Illuminated Keyboard back in 2010.  This keyboard is super high quality and very solid.  It has wonderful weight to it and the price is awesome.  The high quality in this Cherry Stream Keyboard used to be there for Logitech ones before they lost their way and now their keyboards maybe last 1-2 years and double the price of this keyboard.  The price is so good for the quality!  I might buy 2 more to keep around when I wear out the one I am using.  I just hope that the quality continues to remain high.Now I am wondering if Cherry makes mice as well.  If they are high quality as this keyboard, I would definitely switch to buying mice from them too!  As for ""Spill Proof"" or ""Spill Resistent"", I have not tested to see if this is the case and do not know how that works with this keyboard. I just wonder if the keys are engineered to be moisture proof?  As of now, I am really happy to have researched and come across this this keyboard.  I highly recommend for anyone who types fast and often like myself because it is saving my wrists and fingers.....",0,2

This keyboard is very well made and has some weight to it. I really like how there is a light indicator for the Caps Lock, Num Lock and Scroll keys. Another cool feature is the quick keys they have for the computer lock, web, email and calculator. Those keys come in handy. If you want a nice keyboard that is inexpensive. This is a keyboard for you. This was a great purchase at around $25.",2,2

The keyboards largely available today are, well crap.  They're membrane keyboards that feel like I'm mashing soft jelly beans.  The keys flop this way and that as they travel, without much sense of connection, and at the same time, make more noise and clack than you'd expect in a membrane keyboard.Scissor keys are also membrane keys, but the scissor actions keep the keys from floating on the membrane, and make for a much more stable feeling key press.  It's more guided than using membrane alone, so the keys stay flat all the way down, even if you're not exactly on top of the key itself.And above all, most important in my house with a light-sleeping wife who can hear a flea sneeze at a thousand yards, this keyboard is QUIET.  Damn near silent, in fact.  The space bar is a bit quieter than the space bar on the K740, which is an added bonus.If this was illuminated, it'd be almost perfect. If it had a wrist rest, AND was illuminated, it'd be perfect.But given I mostly touch type anyhow, and have desk lamps I can use to see what I'm doing, I'm OK with it not being illuminated.  Better still, it's almost 1/3 the cost of the Logitech K740 (when they were still being made, that is).  That lets me afford  to make a wrist rest that can hold the keyboard in place better than the Logitech would stay in place.One caveat to note: I did NOT get this for gaming.  I have a mechanical game pad for that.  I got this for rapid, accurate typing.  I bought one, and will buy a few more for spares like I did the K740 - and wore them all out.  Yes, I do a LOT of typing.  On the order of a million or more words each year.  As such, I'm exceptionally picky about my motherboards, and do not recommend them lightly.  In fact, I'm a pretty harsh critic of virtually everything else out there that I've tried.Of all the keyboards I've tried to replace the no longer made K740 (probably more than half a dozen), this fits the feel of the K740 the best.  If you want that feel, with some minor adjustments for the wrist rest and the lack of illumination, I'd highly recommend this.",-1,1

I'd prefer it to be ergonomic, but right now having full-sized keys, with the navigational keys to the right in their own section and not mixed in with the other keys, having the keys the right width, and the print screen key in the right place (other keyboards put it over the backspace key, which is the worst location ever, as it gets hit all the time by accident) make this keyboard a winner for me.  It's sturdy than several others I tried, and has a nice feel to it.  Not silent, but not loud either.  I use this keyboard both for work and for home, so it gets a lot of work out.

This keyboard has keys that are well formed, not just identical squares but raised trapezoids, if that makes sense, giving my fingers a far better feel for placement than the super flat ones.  The keys seem very responsive, quiet, but give me the ability to type my 100+ wpm with no lost characters or missing spaces.  I love that it does not have all the extra keys I don't use (number pad); makes it far more efficient for my purposes (editing).  I'm very pleased with it.  Ecstatic in fact.  It lives up to its name, and it wasn't expensive.  Excellent.",2,2

I needed a replacement and sadly it's now obsolete with no low profile replacement.I'm happy with the price and feel of the butterfly keys on the Cherry Stream. It is the most like the KB740 I found.I tried to like an incredibly engineered Keychron Q5 mechanical and the slightly more ergonomic but less customizable Logitech K845. Ultimately I returned both and settled on the Cherry Stream. Despite all the power user rave reviews, for me the mechanical keyboards' higher profile, noise and the hassle of trying to guess which of the myriad key resistance profiles I may or may not like (sight unseen) were all too much.A few first impressions after a week with the Cherry Stream: 1) The Stream's key feel is a little stiffer than the KB740  and the keys have a little more of a textured feel. Neither better nor worse... just different.  2) Cherry uses Caps and Numlock LEDs on the keys. I like this better than the clustered status lights on the KB740.  3) The Stream isn't backlit and doesn't have a wrist rest like the KB740. The Stream's low profile doesn't really require a wrist rest. I'd prefer the backlight but it's not a must have as 99.9% of the time I've got a light on when I'm working.  4) The Stream includes dedicated keys over the NUM pad to lock the screen and open your default mail, browser and calculator. Handier than the KB740 function combo keys which I never used.  5) The KB740 has a larger Delete Key vs. the Stream that uses a smaller Delete and Insert key. I prefer the larger Delete key.  6) The Stream includes a left and right Windows key. To fit in the extra key, the Stream's Function key and space bar are shorter than the KB740. Again neither better nor worse, just different.  7) Last, but not least, the Cherry Stream was less than half the price of the Logitech.",0,1

It is one of the better feeling keyboards to type on. The mouse was also surprisingly comfortable, as I don't usually like full size mice.However, the first one I ordered came in a package that had obviously been opened before and repackaged (thankfully at least with fresh batteries), even though it was listed as ""new"" and not ""open box"" (the seller was actually Cherry themselves). One of the rubber feet from the keyboard was already detached in the black tissue paper it comes wrapped in, but I was able to stick it back on. The keyboard would not power on at all without fidgeting with the batteries a little. I finally got it to work, and it was fine for about a week, and then the spacebar started to squeak. I exchanged it for another.The second one was fine also for about a week, and this time appeared to be unopened and had no problems powering on the keyboard. However, after a week, it thinks the ALT key is permanently depressed. Every keystroke registers as ALT + the key. I tried turning it off and on, replacing the batteries. Nothing helped. I also tried different USB ports just for the heck of it. Also, the mouse with the second set tended to sometimes lose the button press or register a double button press, which I didn't experience with the first one I returned. So I am returning this as defective and getting something else as these seem to be plagued with poor quality control.I am really disappointed in the quality. Even the USB transmitter, the metal piece is not glued to the plastic part. When removing it from the USB port, the metal tends to stay inserted while the plastic pulls out, so I had to use a pliers to extract the metal part from my port. This happened with BOTH keyboards I tried. FWIW, these are supposedly designed by Cherry in Germany, but they are manufactured in China. I really expected better than this, given Cherry's reputation and my past experience with their KC 6000 slim keyboard, which was excellent but fell the unfortunate victim of a spill, which prompted me to replace it with this.",-1,-2

It's solidly-built and the keyboard feels great without being noisy. The mouse is a mouse.Pros:* Build quality seems excellent (both keyboard and mouse).* The key feel is nice; light effort required but decent tactile feedback while being fairly quiet.* Perfectly standard 104-key layout. (No Fn key screwing up the positioning of the Ctrl/Alt keys!) Bonus row of multimedia buttons if you care about that (I don't).* Caps lock, scroll lock and num lock status lights built into the keys themselves. This ultimately doesn't really improve functionality but it's a nice touch.Cons:* Prone to registering double keystrokes.* Not sure why but my hands tend to get ""lost"" while I'm not looking and I'll end up using the wrong keys.* Super flat keycaps tends to result in hitting neighboring keys if you miss the center of a key.* The mouse sometimes doesn't register my motions unless I pick it up and set it back down.Ultimately I'm going to be replacing this soon because while I do love the feel of the keyboard it just doesn't work well for me as a touch typist for whatever reason.",0,0

Nice tactile feel. Little bit of click. I normally use blues but still found this very enjoyable to type on. The mouse is straight garbage though.

I have an old Logitech K235 (which is awful) that I decided to replace and decided on the Stream.I use the keyboard both for touch typing and as command keys for CAD work.The Stream keyboard lives up to the reputation of being a great keyboard.  It's not quite to the level of the Logitech MX Keys in my opinion, but it definitely is responsive and feels good.  The keyboard gets a solid A.The mouse, on the other hand, gets an F.  It is a failure.  The button presses easily gets misregistered unless you press firmly down on the button.  If you relax your press a little bit, but not to the point of releasing past the tactile click that should be separating pressed versus unpressed states, the mouse registers a release even though your finger is pressed down.For data entry or casual web browsing use, where it's all about simple clicks, this mouse would be okay.  But if you do a lot of precise clicking or dragging, the resulting errors are horrible.  If quiet mouse clicks are important (to its credit, this mouse is quiet), you might let it pass with a D-.I thought it was just a defective unit.  I contacted Cherry support who advised me to just exchange it for another set from Amazon.  However, the replacement set had the same problem with the mouse.You can easily see the effect yourself.  Fire up a painting program and draw series of lines, gently easing up on the finger pressure.  You'll be able to easily find a dead zone where the mouse button still feels like you are pressing it down, but the mouse no longer thinks you are.  I have attached a picture showing the resulting gaps (highlighted in red) from drawing a series of what should be continuous lines.So, the keyboard is great.  The mouse is junk.  If the combo set is prices the same as the keyboard by itself, having the mouse as an emergency spare might be beneficial.  But this mouse should not be a primary mouse.",-1,0

I obviously am not docking this product for not having those because I knew full well what I was purchasing since I have yet to find a keyboard that meets all of those criteria exactly. However that being said, this is realllllly close to what i'm looking for. The keys are a little noisy, even with your fingers just resting on them however its easy, fast and accurate to type with. Added bonus IS THAT THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON HAS A LIGHT ON IT telling you when you have it on. Seems like a ""duh"" function, but there are many keyboards that turn off the caps lock light after sometime. This keyboard has almost everything that I need and nothing that I don't! It's also hefty and very well packaged. The mouse is actually really nice and somewhat hefty, however I noticed that the left mouse button requires a bit more pressure to 'stay' activated. (think click and drag scenario)I mainly purchased this just for the keyboard, but I think this is a great backup mouse. Overall, I can see myself with keyboard for some time and I think for the $50 range (considering I've tried several in the 20$ range) this was a great buy. Would definitely recommend.",1,2

I use it 20 hrs a week and it has not let me down. The keyboard is comfortable for a non-wrist rest set up and I can type freely without fatigue.The keys. The scissor switches in this keyboard feel great and are a bit softer than your usual dell/hp office keyboard. They also are noticeably larger than your run of the mill keyboard which for me prevents me from fat fingering keys. The material honestly looks cheap, BUT I actually love the way it feels and the texture prevents my fingers from slipping.The sound and feel. The sound is quiet but not silent. Depending on how hard you type you can definitely ghost write a message to your friend about how bad the lady’s perfume smells in the adjacent cubicle or you can clack away to show your boss how hard of a worker you really are. The keys feel mushy but have a slight snap to them. It kind of reminds me of an almond joy, mushy until you feel the crunch of the almond in the center. Dang I wish I had one…***If you decide to buy this keyboard and do not have a felt desk/key mat I highly suggest buying one. The keyboard sounds tinny and rattles with out it. Especially with the stands up. A soft mat will cure this horrific curse.**Overall. If you don’t want to piss off your coworkers with your RGB, tactile, thocky, keyboard masterpiece (LETS GO KEYCHRON) definitely get this keyboard. If you don’t really care about keyboards in general just get a $35 dell or hp and call it a day. This isn’t the best office keyboard nor is it probably the best in its class. However it is good, and I do enjoy using it while I work in the office. Did I pay an extra $10 because it says cherry? Yes. Did it also come with a really cool calculator button that saves me 10 seconds of time? Also yes. If you get it you won’t regret it! Well maybe..honestly I don’t but idk you do you.",1,1

I was told about the Cherry KB a long time ago but never had the opportunity to use one.  I regret that error in judgment, should'a done it.  I've used, at one time or another, most of the KB's our there.  This one is solid, smooth, crisp and like I said my fingers  almost flow over the keys.  I always thought that the old IBM KB was best, This is better, a better general feel.  Obviously I'm Impressed.  The mouse fits my stubbly little fingers well (as well as crayons fit my stubby little fist) it's fast, smooth and gives me more control than I am used to.  My partner, whose features are far more elegant than my own, finds that it also fits her well as well. It allows me to rest the heel of my palm on the desk and still reach all of the screen with the cursor.  It's an all around win, I hope over time, it keeps being as impressive.

There are a lot of us that LOVE the Logitech - K740 and wish it were coming back. In the meantime, I would suggest this Cherry Stream model. I tried this from an online recommendation indicating it was a good replacement and similar to the Logitech - K740, and I have to say I am quite pleased. I purchased two, one for the home and one for the office. I have tried 20+ keyboards in search of replicating the Logitech - K740, and this is the closest.

They REALLY want you to get the  smart app from MS store.  You can find an allinone driver online if you look, this is what I did.2. The printer could not be found in wifi discovery mode using a win10 virtual machine.  I tried running the install/discovery over usb  with my virtual machine only to end with an ""unknown error' in HPs software.3. I had to dig out a full win 10 laptop for this to find the printer at all....  It did find a printer on the network (i guess step 2 kind of worked when it prompted for wifi / pw).  I had to again go through half a dozen questions about sharing info, create accounts etc...4.  With the software finally complete (1hour in)  I launch the HP smart app in win10 because I want to scan a document.  I am prompted with a ""In order to scan, please sign in with your HP account""  ....  WTF???  No, just no.  I am in no way signin into HP services to use my own scanner.That's the last straw.So, I can't scan unless my internet is up and running since scanning is now an HP cloud service????Every time I launch the HP smart app, Ihave to again answer the same "" please share your diagnostic data with HP""  over and over and over.I had a Brother all in one.... that is what I should have bought again.... serves me right for going cheap.A printer should plug right in or be wifi configurable from an LCD panel.  It should scan to a network location/nas/connected storage without the need of an online cloud service.  It should work with a a linux 'generic laser' printer device.  This P.O.S. does none of that.Do not buy this.  I promise you it is frustration in a box.",-2,-2

The printer throws an account error. Getting help from HP is an exercise in frustration. I likely only managed 200 pages out of this printer since I've owned it. Permanently done with HP.My main requirement for a printer is that it is reliably available. I ditched a Brother printer that presented chronic connection issues via direct USB cable for this HP laser multi-function unit. It isn't any better!I have a powerful router, and everything else in my house, electronics of various kinds, have no issues staying connected, but this HP printer can be relied on to drop the WIFI signal from just across the room. It annoys me that nearly every time I need to print, I have to waste 15-20 minutes cycling the power and the wifi, and that's if it decides to connect at all.",-2,-2

I do what they tell me, answer the question, then sit here and wait.The instructions in the last communication do not work with my new router. I am supposed to press my blinking Wi-Fi button on my printer then within thirty seconds, run to the next room where the router is and press the WPS button.I had no idea what a WPS button is, so I asked...and waited...and waited...finally just looked it up online myself. Turns out the new eero routers do not support WPS, so I'm sitting here waiting for the tech support person to come back and explain what I should try next.This printer does not have a control panel to reset the Wi-Fi password. I might have to order an ethernet cable to hook it directly to my laptop in order to change the password...this is ridiculous. The printer did not come with an ethernet cable.

But- after many tries-  it fails to let me set up WiFi with my new Mac Book Pro Monterey system.  I tried everything- research on this said that this HP printer may have wifi connection issues with some newer Macs due to HP not updating the drivers to be compatible. On a couple attempts to connect printer to my Mac via WiFi- HP's online system directed me to the Apple store- which offered me compatible driver to buy. Forget that. It will print from my smartphone & I bought a cable on Amazon that lets me print from the Mac Book Pro.  I print very little- so it's ok.,0,0

Wireless set up took 1 minute using WPS. You do not have to use the HP Smart app to set-up, print or make copies. You do have to use it to scan. And you do have to give it access to your wireless network to scan. However you do not need it for anything but scanning and you can turn off its' permission to the network under settings, Privacy, on the iPad. You can tell HP not to annoy you with anything when you set up the account. It cost $99.99 when I bought it in August, so a pretty good deal as my Canon copier (I bought the HP primarily to make copies) has an issue with the laser unit right now. From my quick look at the HP Smart app I judge it, the app, to be somewhat difficult to use but very full featured if that is what you are looking for. This printer/copier/scanner is small, lightweight and fast and very easy to use. For those who say that the app doesn't work on a desktop, there is a separate piece of software for the desktop machines. And for those who found no directions, you must download the user manual from HP. Just Google ""HP LaserJet MFP M140w Wireless Printer user manual"" and get it. The quick start guide is in the box as is the power cord. You can attach this printer to a desktop/laptop via USB with the proper cord which is not included.",1,1

As 73 yr old techie lady I was prepared for a challenge but nope not necessary. I just read directions and set up easy peazy.This was so different from setting up the brother inkjet I purchased last month. I struggled and still couldn't get it to make simple copy without defaulting to web/PC or somewhere other than my 4 n1 unit.My laptop is experiencing Win O/S issues and so I used my 2 yr old Moto Android cell for set up.Directions easy to read and follow. Printer worked perfectly and now I can print and copy without reinventing the wheel every time I need a hard copy.This machine is also very small. I was pleasantly surprised by the footprint.The simple to use display is easy to use and read.It's a little noisy but who cares when it's quick and efficient.I would recommend and would purchase again. So happy to finally have a printer from this decade to interface with my newer electronics.,2,2

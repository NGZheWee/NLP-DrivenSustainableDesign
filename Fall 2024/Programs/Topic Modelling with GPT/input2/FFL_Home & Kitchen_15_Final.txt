My yerba mate bag was delivered with a three inch cut in the bag. A very large amount of tea was spilling out of the bag into the box. The item isn’t eligible for refund or replacement. It’s not worth risking this happening again.Going to be buying Yerba Mate from my local Co-Op from now on. However I would repurchase this if it was eligible for replacement because I’ve had the this brand of Yerba before and the taste is great.

I've tried several other yerba mates and this is by far the lowest quality. The resulting brew is completely cloudy from all of the dust. I wish it tasted as good as their canned drinks! The best one I have found is called Heretic.

I am a tea enthusiast.  I love oolong.  I saw this tea and thought Id try it.  It tastes like mildewy dirt.  Worst tea Ive ever tasted.

It does not look like high quality mate, it does not taste as yerba mate. It is basically a mate dust mixed with mate sticks that you are making.

Bag ripped open and spilling everywhere. Teas fine tasting. Used for a healthy detox. Easy to make in french press.

This product came to me in a box wrapped in light cellophane after unwrapping. the cellophane I noticed a slice in the side of the bag.. For some reason, I cannot return it - this  item is not eligible. Help

Those items I had received today the Yerba mate was damage cut and shea butter was open , Pls refund My Money

I received this product with a big hole and two tiny holes in the packaging. The teabags are not sealed in anything besides this outer packaging so the tea could easily be contaminated and unsafe. I tried to do a refund or return and this product was listed not eligible. BEWARE buying this product as you will have no recourse if sent a damaged product.

Terrible taste. This is not returnable - do nit recommend!

Item has arrived with a 1 inch hole in it. Even though the item is "not returnable", Amazon was so kind to refund my purchase and allowed to keep this mate. I took chances (risking getting some mouse poo into my gourd) and tried brewing a cup of it - tastes totally disgusting similarly to lawnmower clippings but imho due to that this mate is neither smoked nor aged, having funky sweet finish that I hated the most. The rest of the pack went straight to garbage.Guayaki no more...

I’ve been a Yerba Mate drinker for many years and I’ve almost exclusively bought Guayaki brand tea bags, when not in Central America. For some reason, the last few bags that I’ve bought from Guayaki have been bland or completely flavorless. I’ve even tried brewing as many as 5 tea bags at once, with no improvement. What used to be my go-to brand of Yerba Mate tea, now is little more than green-ish hot water. Whatever the manufacturer did to reduce their costs has been done at the expense of the consumer end-product.

This is only about how I received my order. It was open and spilled out everywhere as I brought the airspace plastic wrap out of the box.

I love Yerbe and have bought a few diferent types. This one comes in a terrible package that is flimsy.It is weak tasting and brewing.I got my money back cause,it had a funky smell as well. And 20 dollars? Forget it.

The product is good, but I ordered and paid for a pack of 6 and only 1 arrived. I don't see any way to get a refund. Not great!

As soon as I open the package the seal was busted and spilling out, I try and dump it in the container and its mostly powder and as I proceed to try the product the quality was the worst I've ever tasted. If your reading this before buying, do yourself a favor and Try another brand.

Yerba ate does have a bitter taste, but this product showed up looking, and tasting, like it had been forgotten on a shelf somewhere.Not good, very dry and full of very small particulates that are not easily filtered.Look elsewhere for your Yerba Mate.

Came with hole in the bag. My mistake for ordering and not checking the return policy. This was my second order of Guayaki organic Yerba Mate. The flavor is better then other brands. I will have to find another seller.

The bag of tea was popped open and tea was spilling out upon arrival. For some reason I cant return or exchange the item and that doesn’t seem fair since it was broken/damaged upon delivery.

Just opened this package, tea bags inside are broken, looks like a mouse chewed it up. The problem here is a can't return it or replace it. If I can get a replacement my rating could change.

It pains me to write this review as I love the product and have been enjoying it for 5 or more years.Most recent purchase came with a hole in the bag and per the manufacturer, not Amazon there is no return policy.As I can't find this in stores near me I'll be looking for another brand with a proper return policy.

I was happy to see my bag of tea arrived quickly, but upset when I opened the package. The item was damaged with multiple holes. Safely consuming this tea based on its presentations is questionable. I was really looking forward to trying out his product as a fan of Guayaki's canned Yerba Mate drinks, but I was left with disappointment.

The item lists it as 75 tea bags but when it came it was loose tea, no bags.  I want to return it or get it replaced due to the false/wrong advertising but it says no returns and no one is helping me.

No good

Did not try since bag torn on all corners! But have loved the tea as it provided slowly elevated energy.I am sure the taste is great, BUT did not try since bag torn on all 4 corners!

The taste is just ok and it didn’t help with appetite as I had hoped. Not worth the price for me. Going back to green tea.

Upon opening the delivery envelope, I found the bag had been cut open, as if with a razor knife.When I clicked on the return item page, I was informed that this product is NOT eligible for returns.So $18 down the drain. The price on this stuff is ridiculously high, but this is the ultimate ripoff.Thanks for nothing

Arrived damaged/ the bag had broken Open and tea bags everywhere, but there is nowhere to ask for a replacement or refund. 😞 plus some of the bags got rained on/ wet

Bag was ripped when received, unsure if still safe to drink!

Package was damaged and you can’t RETURN if damaged.

Everything was going smooth with the process of returning, but when the time came to do the return to get my money back the seller reached out anymore, after sending him reminder of the refund.

Was excited for this product UNTIL IT CAME RIPPED OPEN >:( can’t even get a replacement for it! Waste of my money! Covered in tea powder - thanks a lot >:(

No value for my money as I have to throw it out. It arrived with two holes in it and It is not eligible for return. Frustrating

Used to love this until I found out that Yerba Mattes have PAHs in them. Even the air dried ones like this. You can check out their website where they explain they've "reduced" PAH concentration but really, none is the right amount. PAH (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are known carcinogens and recent studies show higher cancer rates among frequent matte drinkers in south america. I'm not taking a chance, personally. I love black tea just as much if not better.

Bag arrived with a hole in it. Tea is everywhere..

Product arrived with a hole in it, leaking into another separate plastic bag it had been placed in.  No returns allowed, definite waste of money…

This was shipped damaged (ripped bag) and a replacement was not sent to me despite numerous attempts

I only tried this brand because the cost of my regular Yerba mate (Eco) jumped from around $9.50 a lb to $25 in a 3 week period. I paid around $15 for this brand. There is no comparison to Eco. I was very disappointed. Guayaki has a weak strange taste. I ended up throwing half the bag out. I did find my beloved Eco brand on another site for the price I usually pay.

Bag was received punctured and there's no return/replacement policy. Don't buy.

I ordered the 75 ct. tea bags thinking it would be a nice alternative to black tea in the morning. I received a large package of loose tea so now in order to use it I have to go buy something to brew loose tea. I’m not very happy that now I need to spend more money in order to use this.

Product packaging was damaged upon deliver. Not suitable for consumption

I was super excited to try Yerba mate but I received a broken package :(

The bag was torn, there was a hole in it & most of the tea came out. I would like to get a replacement since I cannot return it! I’m a regular customer and I’m not satisfied.

Both of my bags of tea arrived open

Product arrived with a hole in the the bag and loose mate all over the box (and now my living room). Not acceptable from a consumer safety standpoint either. I will not be drinking it.

The package was ripped open when I received it!

The bag had chew marks from rodents

My product arrived with a hole in it. Could I have a new one and send it back?

Product arrived with holes in packaging, no way to return or request refund through app

I started using 2 TABLESPOONS of tea and there is no caffeine at all in my tea. Nothing compared to the drinks at all. Something doesn’t seem right. Not accurate at all. Very disappointed.

After telling me my shipment was stuck in customs, I received it a couple days later but it is not USDA organic. It is in packaging from Argentina in Spanish. So I have no idea if it’s the same quality or not as the Yerba that it available in the US.

I am very displeased with the packaging/shipping. The Mate was packed very poorly with other products. When I opened the box, I found that the packet ended up with a couple of small holes from being knocked around. Luckily not a lot of Mate came out of the packet. The Mate itself is pretty good. Please take better care while packaging the product for shipping next time.

tea leaves felt overly dry and had little taste

I've decided to end my dependence on coffee and decided to give Yerba Mate a try. Used one tea bag to start with and kept adding hot water to my cup throughout the day. I did not notice any miraculous pick-me up properties (for that, you need 2 tea bags), however, had no crashes either nor did it interfere with my sleep. Everything was going well until I went for a check up and discovered that my systolic blood pressure went up by over 25 points and diastolic - by 8. There were no lifestyle changes that I could recall, so my immediate suspect was Yerba Mate. I Googled the heck out of it and yes, consensus is that it can raise your blood pressure. I discontinued it immediately and my blood pressure is back to normal. Buyer beware.

I typically drink loose leaf Guayaki mate and thought i'd give these a try for convenience sake. Big mistake. I knew these were going to be weaker than loose leaf because i probably brew mine a little strong compared to some, so i tried starting out with 2 bags instead of just 1. It was so weak it barley even tasted like yerba mate, with TWO satchels. It also gave little to no energy/focus boost like loose leaf normally does. I guess i'll try 3-4 tomorrow and see how it comes out.I absolutely love Guayaki loose leaf, and so far hate these. Would not recommend.

I've been buying this brand of Yerba Mate for years & recently I couldn't find the smaller box so I had to buy this larger one.It does not taste like the real Yerba Mate & I e-mailed & called Guayaki, & they said they don't sell it in this size anywhere, & they don't sell on Amazon, so infer what you will, as my first review was already rejected.I just wasted my money on this product.

I followed the instructions to brew the tea to the dot, but all i tasted was the smell of yerba matte but not the flavor. The earlier order of the same product was a lot better and i could really feel the effects of yerba matte i.e improved cognition etc. For some reason, even after i let it seep for 15 minutes, all i could taste was hot water. I am really unhappy with the tea and have asked for refund which Amazon graciously did!!Thank you Amazon

I have been buying this same tea for years now and love it - normally. This last package did not taste right? It tasted like just a normal tea? And I did not finish using the 75 bags because towards the end, it tasted funky. The date code was 2019, but something was not right with this batch or something. I want to order again and I will add my comments. I hope this new batch is better.

Great tea,  I have been a long time consumer.  Great taste, but seller took great advantage of brief supply change issue.  I paid almost twice what I usually do in the grocery store.  Fortunately Yerba Mate is back in my store.  5 stars for the product and minus 3 for the seller.

I was super excited for this but I received it open and leaking everywhere. And I can’t return it.

Came Damaged and not offering, should have been big red flag.

There seem to be plentiful 5 star reviews for this product so I am in the minority. Either I got an off batch or my taste buds just don't care for this stuff. I also read articles that this product should not be consumed in large quantities because it could contribute adversely to your health due to an ingredient? I know you can't believe everything you read and if you moderate anything you consume it is always the wisest choice (goes without saying, I know...). But I'm just saying it is not for me. I will stick with black tea, green tea, and coffee.

Just like the title says.  I found the loose leaf to hardly give me any caffeinated effect, and it is all powder.  So it will leak out of your defuser/bag/etc.  I recently tried this brand and it is 10x better  https://www.amazon.com/Yerba-HI-CAFFEINE-CERTIFIED-Organic-SUPER-GREEN/dp/B0774VSX34/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/147-6205947-3778940?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0774VSX34&pd_rd_r=1e505d36-f4bc-4f10-b855-844021baffa9&pd_rd_w=Apa84&pd_rd_wg=LDtQD&pf_rd_p=6c927ef5-6938-465b-8f66-e5683dae7ef8&pf_rd_r=514ZBX60XWJGGXNVXG47&psc=1&refRID=514ZBX60XWJGGXNVXG47

No flavor. It makes the water yellow, that's the only way you can tell there's a tea bag in it.For Yerba Mate tea bags I'd suggest Rosamonte's Mate Cocido. Way more flavor.

I always beef it up with other things, chai spices, dark roast yerba mate, Korean herb tea, etc.It's a good thing it's so inexpensive because it takes 3 bags to make a decent cup of tea, even with additions.PS. March 2014. I bought a new order, hoping they improved the taste. It's worse. It's gotten more BITTER. So I would reduce rating to a 2 stars.

Great that it's organic. The bag easily tears, the Mate taste gross unless you drink it right after its brewed, like literally right after. Don't attempt to store this for more than an hour, it just becomes unpalatable. Forget this stuff and pick up a box of their Mate chocolate. Its good, not blow your mind good like Teavana, but I wouldn't mind drinking it if I had a box.

It gives me complete blindness for 45 second after 10 minutes when I took one cup of Guayaki tea.So, imagine if I start to drive my car after taking tea - I could be involved in a car accident in a way that is not intendedor planned.So I am not making Guayaki tea.It was waste of money.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Previous orders were fine, but this one was not😔

the packaging that the loose mate comes in had little tear near the top and bottom so it wasn't that fun to open. i had to put it in a different container after receiving. i guess its because its a biodegradable package and it was not meant to be thrown around in a box. other than that, every things good

This mate is okay the quality of the leaves is weak they last about two cup fulls before losing taste and if I leave a cup out for a day the damp leaves turn into this mucky dark smelly cluster. This hasn't happened with other brands of mate

I love the Yerba Mate Chocolate, but I'm not a fan of this tea. It has the smell of fresh cut grass. That's not a terrible smell, but not great for tea. I'm sure others might like this, but I had never tried it before I bought this big bag. My bad.

I didn't wanna wait a whole day for Amazon to send Eco so i bought this instead from whole foods. Weak. Powder and sticks. Picture clearly shows the difference.

GOOD PRODUCT, BUT HAS WAY EXSPENSIVE. PRICE KEEPS GOING UP?

I like the taste, and I like the effects.  However, this package was mostly powder.  Nearly HALF of it fell through my tea strainer into my glass.

Not impressed with the quality.  Powdery as opposed to bring a concmsistent leaf product.  Will not buy again.

Not the same product as the 25 bag edition.

The leaves are too small, kind of crushed and they are not strained by the bombillo.You definitely need to use a filter or a press strainer.

Tea is good, but I do not see any weight loss or energy benefits that were advertised.  Another gimmicky product.

it was ok but not what I expected.  Ordered a different Yerba Mate and it was much better

Not what I was expecting, I love the Yerba Mate Chocolate, drink it every day

It doesn't taste like the mate I'm used to. Very weak. And doesn't include the usual tee bag string to help with steeping

They taste pretty bad.. though that might be what maté tastes like.

More powder then leaves.. i have to filter out the powder ..

Did not work for my shoulder and neck pain, I tried to increase drinking more times of day and did nothing

Personal taste, didn't like the flavor. Too bitter.

This coffee taste like brown s***!

Taste was ok, but no "bubbles" (inactive)

It didn't make any difference

it is sour as hell

Bad after taste

cold brewed and still quite bitter. also made me feel gross. weird since i have bought the mint version before and done great.

Very mild tasting.

I think this was smoked because it tastes like a cigarette tray yuck!

I’m giving this 2 star to the Guayaki company (not the product) but because of the marketing campaign. I was born and raised in Paraguay and it’s extremely insulting to see people appropriating something so sacred to us! First of all IT IS NOT a product from Argentina or Brazil. It was originated in Paraguay during the first big war, where the tribes called Guayakí (emphasized the í) used the leaves of the Yerba mate because of the high hydration properties as they didn’t have access to clean water. Later on it was adopted by other cultures, also big part of Argentina and Brazil used to be all part of Paraguay called “Rio de la plata” under Spain rule. Terere and mate is extremely sacred to Paraguayans and the fact that they're the less credited is extremely insulting! Learn the culture first and they you can use them, we don’t mind you using them for profits but have some respect specially for a country where most people identifies as Guarani ancestry!

This is a ton of tea for what you pay for. It tastes great and I love the energy. However there were a lot of sticks and dust in my bag. With all this dust, how can it be fresh? It's dried to hell and back.

I have to note that I could have received a faulty product or this product uses a lower quality Yerba Mate. My opinion is based on trying "Guayaki Yerba Mate Organic Tea, 25-Count" (also from amazon but cost more) and the bottled drink version. Both of which gives me a powerful jolt of energy, it is more gradual then coffee but for people who don't consume caffeine regularly- you will feel it.I have been trying this on and off for about 2 months now. I can say with confidence that there is little to no caffeine compared to the other versions (same brand) I tried. Normally one tea bag would do the job and wake me up, however I have even used TWO teabags (supposedly 80 MG of caffeine) and feel nothing what-so-ever.The 2 stars are for :-The price point is great, the box of 25 tea bags cost more than this 75 tea bag. (This has me question the product even more)-The taste is relatively the same, if you are in it for the flavor then this works just fine for that. If you are looking for a better way to get your caffeine, I would not recommend this.

The first time I purchased, it was great! It was mostly all leaves.The 2nd had more stems and dust, thought it was a one off.  But this most recent purchase had so many stems and dust particles.

I’ll get straight to the point, this has decent caffeine kick but that’s about it. Mostly bitter, and only tolerable with ice cold water. If you’re after calming variety of Yerba, then avoid this. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, avoid this.There are much better brands like cruz de malta & playadito if you’re after milder variety.

This seller needs to either pack the product in a box (not envelope) to avoid damage or stop sending out broken bags. My bag had 2 holes in it and some of the tea was spilled.The taste is good but have nothing to compare with.Tea itself has a lot of dust and sticks but I suppose for better quality we must pay more. Oh, well. Next time.

Yerba Mates are great teas and I order all the time but do not care for their marketing at all.Yerba tea bags cost $2.30 an ounce which is expensive but a very good start. This five pounds of loose tea is sold for only $.47 an ounce. The cheapest green tea from china sells for $.60, not organic not Fair Trade which makes this tea an excellent healthy option in USDA organic form. Guayusa has a smoother taste than Yerba Mate. Any food item sold directly by Amazon, not a third party means fresh due to high turn over. This is an excellent price especially when competition sells this tea for $9 in a 8oz bag.The first people to discover Yerba Mate were the Guarani (pronounced wa-ra-nee). Their traditional homeland in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil overlaps the home range of wild yerba mate. I was born in a tea family. I drink over ten cups of tea every single day. I have been doing that for decades and decades. USDA organic, a certified USDA, Kosher, Fair Trade. Those three items ORGANIC, KOSHER, FAIR TRADE, guarantee a superior product, fair treatment of workers and environment. I drink many different teas and even the cheapest USDA organic, Kosher but not Fair Trade tea like Davidson's green tea sells for $10 a pound and once again not a Fair Trade ingredient. Amazon has great pricing. To get the most out of my tea, I do not treat these teas like I do with the real expensive teas since I drink so many cups of it every single day. Instead I make these teas in coffee percolator since I like my tea really hot and I hate waste. Percolator get all its colors out but I treat the black tea differently.A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle -- this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling.Remember it is only a tea, there is no antioxidants, no youth, no energy, no nutritious stimulants except caffeine which is natural ingredient and all other miracles claimed by all those producers of Yerba Mate especially WEIGHT LOSS are all marketing tools. The only weight loss that I know of is exercise and cutting calories consumption unless one is truly genetically or chronically sick. These producers need to remove those claims since it is very misleading. Antioxidants are the most misused word in health and diet. There is not even a measurement of such ingredient called antioxidant in any food NUTRITION FACT table. It is a tea not a supplement either. I do not consume prescriptions for any chronic condition, supplements, pills, process foods. Only in US with relaxed laws these producers are allowed such marketing. I drink coffee as well as many black teas and none are supplements either except sugar free drinks. These are five star teas. Support those farmers through Fair trade or Fair for Life, certified programs and get yourself a nature given drink just like other plants that I use as tea when infact others only use as a food ingredient in their cooking but ignore the marketing.

The bag was punctured in the corner and made a mess.Tried to reach out with no success .$20 out the window

I like the flavor. Have seen 0 effects in blood sugar, alertness, or anything else.

When I received the package I immediately removed the Yerba Mate from the package and put it in a sealed container to keep it as fresh as possible. This is where I was first disappointed, the majority of the contents were basically powdered. Yerba Mate should be fine put not powdery. I had to step back because of the plume of powdery dust that filled the air as I was pouring it into my container. Already let down I tried to stay positive and continued on. Next I smelled the Mate like I would with any other type of tea to get more of an appreciation for the tea, again I was disappointed. This did not smell like the typical pure Mate's I get from local and online suppliers. Again, I tried to stay positive and remain hopefully that the taste would be the decider. The following morning I brewed some of the Mate, left it on the light side to make sure that I can fully appreciate the tea and adjust the quantity to my specific taste. Once again I was let down. With all other pure Mate's I have had in the past they had a grassy, light lemony/citrus taste to them (which I love). This has a roasted nutty and dark taste to it, not completely unpleasant but I do not seek out the taste.Overall I am extremely disappointed. The only reason it got a 3/5 instead of 2/5 is because the cost is so cheap that I don't feel like I wasted too much money on it. I would not suggest this product to a friend or family.

I like the Guayaki soda drinks. I take them to school for situations when I need a caffeine kick (like staying awake in a boring lecture). I bought the loose leaf version because I can control the sugar content of the drink. I found the flavor pleasant and mild. I know some reviewers are complaining about the taste - perhaps they used boiling water to steep the mate. If you use high temperature to steep the drink it will be bitter and awful. Also, some reviewer are complaining of the dusty residue. It does appear a couple of minutes after you steep the mate. It did not really bother me though. I would like to point out the the leaves themselves are not dusty. It's only after you steep them that you'll see the residue. The main issue that I have with the product is it puts me to sleep instead of keeping me awake. I started nodding off 10 minutes after I took the last sip during the first time I drank it. I thought it was an isolated incident then I tried a week after and I had the same result. Maybe the loose leaf version has some compounds that affect me a certain way - it is unfiltered and unrefined compared to the soda version. I'll keep buying the Guayaki soda drink for the caffeine. I just want to share my experience - it might have the same effect on you.

The only good thing about these is that they are portable. I use approximately 12-16 oz mugs, and need two bags for it to be a palatable strength when compared to loose leaf Rosamonte, which I usually allow to steep in a pot for several days.

I bought this expecting that it would taste similar to the cans or bottles of this same brand of Yerba Mate, but it does not at all. I wouldn’t say the flavor is all that appetizing, although it does not necessarily taste bad either. Pluses are it’s caffeine content and the large number of tea bags you get for the money.

The bag arrived with a tear and the loose leaf tea spilled out

I really enjoyed the yerba mate. Great taste and energy. Unfortunately the packaging was broken when I received it. A lot of it ended up on the floor due to a whole on the side of the bag.

Just introduced to Yerba Matte. Loved it so I ordered the loose tea. Taste is not very strong. I did it in a coffee press. Steeped 5 minutes.  Tried in a cup with almost boiling water poured over. And in my coffee maker as suggested. I’ll keep trying. I’ll update if I can get it more taste.

This stuff is just fine as yerba mate, but you're paying a premium for the brand name while gaining nothing in terms of flavor, effect, etc. I have no problem spending a bit more if it gets me a higher quality product, but in this case it's on par with significantly cheaper options, and in some cases is actually a bit worse.For example, you could pay $14 for 1lb of Guayaki... or you could pick up 2.2lbs of Canarias for $14.15, 2.2lbs of Taragui for $14.20, 2.2lbs of Cruz de Malta for $13.40, etc. All of these are as good as Guayaki, and I think Taragui is actually better.

I'm having tummy trouble,  this tea was recommended to me by several people, but so far nothing is helping.

Though I love mate and I drink it from the traditional gourd, I get it in tea bag form for the convenience. I've bought it before and no complaints, this time however I got a package that was not vacuum sealed and was beat up to all hell. Even some of the tea bags are broken, there goes the convenience factor. Just be wary who you buy from.

The bag was ripped. I noticed other reviewers said the same. Had less flavor than the bag I purchased from the grocery store. I did a smell comparison and this product had much less scent than the store bought package.

The taste is lovely. I mix mine like how I drink my coffee. I would give the product 5 stars!But I'm not sure who is coming up with the price! I'd recommend everyone take a look locally first. Amazon would be last option. These bags started off around $7 and its crept its way to $15 2/27/16

I actually love this tea....drink it everyday, often twice.  Unfortunately, this package was delivered in a very distressed state, very little air inside.  Almost like it had been vacuum packed.  The tea leaves have been broken down so that much of the package is a very fine dust.  Dust is always an issue with this product, but this is almost undrinkable unless one were to strain it with cheesecloth.

This yerba mate isn't that great when compared with other mate distributors.  I bought a pound from Island Teas and it tastes and feels a lot better than this.  Yerba Mate is a great tea but this product doesn't do it justice.  Get the real thing and put it through a coffee maker, cool, and add sugar if you want a good drink.

The package arrive on time and in good order.  The yerba tastes as expected, but the quality was not.  This yerba is full of stems, chunks, and loads of yerba dust.  (I found one stem that was almost 3 inches long)  Maybe it is like this because it is "traditional", but I don't care for it.  I will go back to Eco Teas organic yerba.  Your taste may vary, as all do.

After using the Guayaki bagged Yerba Mate varieties, I had high hopes for this. I prefer loose Yerba Mate, brewing it in a basket in a large mug with hot (never boiling) water. I don't know if was something with the specific lot that my bag came from, but it's been less flavorful than I'm used to. Second brewings were particularly weak, something else that I don't expect from a quality Yerba Mate.

A bit more powdery than I would have expected for a Mate, about 1/3 of it is as finely ground as a matcha! Also, not sure if this is a different type than the 5 other traditional mates that I have had, but it seemed REALLY grassy and green tasting... almost to the point that I'm wonding if there is grass in there... not a bad tea though.

Pretty good stuff, but I prefer more smokey flavor.  Compared to Tadin Yerba Mate for instance, this has more of a "green" taste.  I prefer the flavor of Tadin, but since they do not offer theirs loose I will probably try some of the other offerings from Guayaki once I finish this bag.

It certainly has a different pick me up feeling than coffee.  I prefer not drinking on a regular basis but instead occasionally.  The aroma dry is similar to a cut hayfield or prairie grass in the fall and I imagine the flavor similar.

Great price and taste but WTF? One of the reviewers says it can cause cancer, and I went online and sure enough I read that scientists studied it and yes apparently it has caused cancers. I wish I had known that before ordering. Anyway, I brewed some up and it sure is delicious. But now I'm afraid to drink it.

It smells like hay.....I have to add lots of sweetener to balance it out. However, since I heard that it's a better alternative than coffee, I forced myself to drink it plain haha. *sigh* the things I do sometimes.

I have used this brand for a long time and enjoyed it. I like the taste it produces. However, I eventually tired of all the dust it contains and the mess that makes in the cup (and sink). So, I have stopped using it. You might find it to your liking. It includes stems and such and is finely ground--almost a powder.

These tea bags are not foil lined and air tight - probably kinder to the planet but I wonder if they will preserve the flavor of the tea as well.

Okay this tea does boost your energy and make u regular but it tastes so nasty. It actually made me a little nauseous had to add lots of lemon and splenda and it was still gross. If you can stand the taste it does do what it says it does.

this tea is marketed as tea bags. when i received my shipment it was loose tea. same quality and taste just no bags you have to use a tea ball or something to seep it in

Not the same buzz that I get from the 16ounce Lemon Elation Yerbas of the same brand.  Not even close, even using 3 tea bags.

VERY dusty. Good flavor and everything else considered it was good, but it is so dusty and lots of stems. I am going to go back to other brands I have found here on Amazon.

Does not taste the same !

I like it, it's loaded with caffeine but research shows it causes mouth, esophageal and other cancers if consumed too much.. not like a green tea.

The flavor of this tea is good, but there are better. Also, it contained a lot of twigs and tiny leaf fragments that frequently clogged my bombilla. My favorite brand is Mate Factor. Eco Teas is cheaper and still very good. And they don't clog my bombilla :)

I haven't tried any other Yerba Mate but it has a smokey kind of flavor. It isn't the best tea but everything is an acquired taste in one way or another. Will continue using.

Definitely have tasted better. Very bland yet smokey. Not what I was looking for.

Pretty dusty, which is quite annoying if you are using a tea strainer for anything else, since it's hard to clean. Make sure to brew this with about 170-180F water, not boiling water, unless you like your mate excessively smokey.

Disappointed, This is good quality Mate, but I like Yerba Mate strong like drinking from a gourd. Unfortunately this is more the strength of green tea.

The tea tastes great but you need a real fine strainer to strain it with. A lot of the fine pieces get through my ordinary tea strainer and you do eat some of the tea.

Taste is funky, good amount of product for price. Probably wont get it again, it was a nice try though.

Good flavor but it does have some stems good price.

A taste that is different form any tea i have tried, not sure i would by this type of tea again

It arrived on time and was as advertised. My only issue is with the product itself. It is a really, really mild blend. I prefer the bolder mate's. However it may make a nice TERERÉ

Poor quality tea bags prevented a higher rating.  Many bags were not closed well and leaked contents.

Liked it but the tea bags produced weaker tea than the 25 count

Tastes great but expensive.

I like the tea okay but it is fantastic with sugar or honey, both of which I cannot have.  I does make great iced tea as well.

Tasted ok, i expected more I guess

Nice tea. Nothing special or maybe I missed something????

First Yerba Mate experience. So far so good, but the price is only OK for the amount

Taste is Horrible  :(

I recently tried the Yerba Mate Tea and was pleasantly surprised by its rich flavor and energizing properties. The taste is robust and earthy, providing a perfect pick-me-up for any time of day.One thing I appreciate about this tea is its high quality and authenticity. As a fan of traditional South American beverages, I can attest to the genuine flavor and aroma of this Yerba Mate.The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the tea bags fresh and preserving their flavor. However, the only downside I found was the lack of a string for easy removal of the tea bag. While it's a minor inconvenience, having a string attached would make the brewing process more convenient, especially when using a mug or cup.Overall, I would still highly recommend this Yerba Mate Tea for its taste, quality, and energizing effects. It's a great addition to any tea lover's collection, despite the small drawback of the missing string.

Yerba Mate is a fantastic pick-me-up! It provides a smooth, sustained energy boost without the jitters. The flavor is earthy and refreshing—perfect for a morning ritual or an afternoon lift. Highly recommend!

Great tea, it was a little “too” loose for my tea strainer ball, but it did the job. Good with honey!

It’s great for the price but the only flaw is that it doesn’t come with the little string to pull it out afterwards

Let me first say that I am nowhere near a yerba mate "sommelier" so if your looking for "it has fruity notes and hints of mushrooms and unicorn fluff" that is not going to come from this reviewer.  What I will comment on first is ease of use:  Drop two bags in my large coffee cup put a little water on it then swirl to get the teabags wet (dummy water thing) and let sit for about a minute.  Then put the 170 degree or so water on it.  let it steep.  Enjoy. When you finish, you can put another round of water on it to get a weaker cup (I have gone three rounds on the two bags but prefer to end it at two YMMV).Effects:  As you have read or may not have read, this stuff has a caffeine content above tea but below coffee and has other components involved here as well (Theobromine et.al) so as a life long coffee drinker I can tell you that this will produce a much more elegant buzz that what Mistress Coffee provides.  I feel alert, focused, and very awake without the shakes and stomach upset that coffee sometimes does to the drinker.  I can also tell you that my appetite doesn't go away but I'm not digging thru my desk looking for snack machine change.  I can hold out till lunch.  The after effects are minimal.  I dont crash as hard (if you want to call it crash now) as you do when coffee wears off.  It "ramps up then gently ramps back down"  Which is why I suppose folks drink the stuff in a weaker form all day long.  You keep getting weaker and weaker doses so that you gently come back down.  Does it have the same "gotta go to the potty" effect as coffee...kinda...sorta...not as pronounced.In conclusion:  If you are like me and trying to wean off the coffee and tea just isn't cutting it, this is a very good way to get introduced into the world of yerba mate without all the ritual stuff that you see associated with yerba mate (that slurping sound that is popular with the gourd/bombilla/knit cap in the middle of summer crowd drives me freaking nuts!).  If you like it then you can buy all the stuff and stand on the corner with a gourd or use a french press like I plan on doing.Enjoy your mate.

I am fairly new to Yerba Mate and like Guayaki's offerings. Their cans of mate are great and I have consumed many of them. I have also recently moved to traditional preparation: using a gourd and bombilla. I think this is fun although you have to get accustomed to the taste which is pretty strong and bitter--at first. However, I have found that the taste is acquired.My wife and I really like mate. Guayaki's products are probably pretty comparable to "top of the line." However, there ARE cheaper alternatives like Eco Teas, which is also organic and fair trade (whatever that means ...  I should look it up). I am going to review what I think are the PROS and CONS of mate AS A FORMER ENERGY DRINK CONSUMER (I'll never go back).My OWN experience:PROS--Mental alertness enhanced--Awakens me and actually makes me feel energetic (AS OPPOSED TO jittery and wired)--Enhances my mood. Let me elaborate: I am more introverted than not. When I have consumed some mate I actually feel more positive and inclined to smile and say hi to people, even across a room. I have really liked that.--I feel the claims to "aids elimination" are true. Things tend to keep moving as they should!CONS--Makes my urine smell. :) Like unto asparagus, I have noticed that drinking mate adds a certain ... smell ... to urine. Don't get me wrong though, not a big deal! Just kind of funny and would, well, technically fall under "cons."--The primary thing: I have seemed to notice that if I go a day and a half or so without drinking it I develop a headache. (I DID NOT personally get this with energy drinks for whatever reason.) I am currently doing a experiment to determine if mate "withdrawal" is, in fact, the reason. I'll have to update this later with what I have found.That's the main reason I brought it from five stars down to four. I don't like ANYTHING that creates or causes any form of bodily dependence. I spoke of my headaches to a friend of mine, an avid mate drinker, and he also told me, "Oh yeah, If I were to stop drinking mate I'd have a headache for a week!"Hope the review helps!

I ordered this product b/c after doing some research online for safe supplements to incorporate into my workout I read a blog that more than made mention of the positives of this "tea." I like tea, but I have never been a fanatic about it. The blog stated that the actual loose tea from South America is both inexpensive and POTENT (meaning strong in the effect) vs. the tea sold in the states. I just looked this up on Amazon, saw this was loose tea, it was only $11 (& change + $5 in S&H) so I gave it a whirl. I brew it in my coffee pot, & I usually will circulate it through twice to increase the strength of it. I'll set it up at night (while I'm awake) & brew the first pot, & then prior to going to bed I put the tea back in the reservoir, & set the "Brew Delay" to begin at about 3:45am in the morning before I get up & get ready to go workout. It works well for my digestive system, gives me energy w/out the crash, & I'll add some sugar free French vanilla creamer & Stevia to it sometimes just to give it a little creaminess that makes it "yummy" (for me). The downside to brewing this in your coffee pot is that if you fill up your reservoir for 12 cups of coffee - by the time it finishes brewing you will be down to about 10 (I surmise it is due to the absorption from the dry loose tea sitting in the filter). I am on my 2nd bag in less than 2 weeks, but then again, I am quite active and many times I work at a clinic during the day and then out of a fire dpt at night as a Paramedic so I like to sip it throughout the duration of the day (depending on my schedule). It also doesn't give me a "sour stomach" (when empty) like coffee does. I'd recommend giving it a try!! ...& the shipping was pretty fast!

If you've never had yerba mate before, this might be a little overkill for you since it is 75 bags of the stuff. Try a smaller count option first if you want to get some mate (you don't want to get stuck with 74 bags of something you hate). If you love mate and don't do loose leaf, this is a great option.For people just getting into mate, this is a great option because it is in bags and not loose leaf. Also good for having some mate at work or on the go because you don't have to have a little gourd stuffed with steaming hot water and a handful of mate with a bombilla.There are better tasting mates out there, but this is a very good option for the price and quantity. 75 bags!? You won't find many options out there with that many bags for this price. They are not individually wrapped, so you might get a little dust from the bag, but that's partly contributed to the lower cost since they don't have to package each little bag. Additionally, the tea bags are just that, tea bags. No strings or little tabs to lift the tea bag out. If you hate that, Guayaki makes individually wrapped tea bags with strings, they're just a little more expensive. Not much though, since Guayaki is the more affordable tea bag option for mate. If you're super serious about mate, loose leaf will always be the cheapest option. I've got a 500 gram bag of Rosamonte that I've been working on for the past 3-4 months at work (at ~3g per serving, that's ~167 servings, 30 servings a month, the bag will last just over 5 months).ProsPrice and quantity are greatTaste is goodBagged, not loose leafConsNo string or tab on the bagsNot individually wrappedNot the greatest mate known to man (but still good)

Was going to to give this as a gift with the cup.  The tea package was delivered in a box with a lot of other items and not sure if that caused a hole or if it already had a hole.  I was unable to give it as a gift, so using the tea myself. It is good.

I don't know how the tea is, but it arrived with a hole in the bag, loose leaf coming out, and I just tried to file a return online, says item cannot be returned. I mean, how fresh is it with a hole in the bag? Ugh. UPDATE: Seller reached out to me with a refund.

This is great green tea that I've bought a couple of times!  I used to be a sucker who purchased large amount of loose Yerba Mate at my local tea store for ridiculous prices.  I took a chance and bought this tea from Amazon, and was not disappointed.  I'm not enough of a tea expert to really understand the whole free trade process, but I do know organic is a good thing.  Now, my old expensive tea did have a better taste, but I've learned to appreciate this tea's earthy taste.  I like to mix green and black tea together, and have found that this tea will overpower the brew.  For the price, I'll live with that!  This tea alone will give you a good morning boost without the jittery feeling, but add some black tea and you'll be flying high!

If you like your tea earthy and aren't put off by a bit of "sludge" at the bottom of your cup, this is for you.  I cheat a bit and put dehydrated orange peels in my storage containers to spark up the flavor.  I know that's not for those that take the "traditional" to heart but that's the way that mate was first offered to me and I've continued the practice.  I'm normally a strong black coffee drinker and while I continue to prefer coffee as my stimulant of choice, mate is a great change up.  The "kick" is a bit more subtle than strong coffee and in my opinion seems to not have some of the less desirable side effects (acid stomach, jitters, etc).  Expect this particular version of mate to give good value and meet or even exceed standards as long as you aren't looking for a tea bag clarity in your drink.

I had heard yerba mate was a good substitute of coffee.  Nothing like coffee but it is a really nice cup of tea.  I really enjoyed.

I love the taste of this mate, I love the company and what it stands for, protecting the enviornment & supporting organic farmers, the price here on amazon is really great, I took away one star only because most of my tea leaves were reduced to a very fine powder.  This was my second loose tea leaf purchase (I normally buy tea in bags) and the other loose leaf I bought (different brand, different site) had no fine powder.  So when I make the tea I get a lot of powder in my cup.  Not a huge deal, but I would prefer if the leaves were big enough not to leak through.  I'll probably buy this one more time & if I get the same thing I'll go back to the guayaki mate tea bags, which I love, I just wish they sold in bulk because I run out so quickly!!

The tea came spilling out of its bag:( though am still happy to receive the item! Smells great!

I love to make mate tea and having found this in Amazon was a blessing.  They are separate tea bags in a foil package that keeps them fresh.  I usually use two tea bags when I make my mate, but it still lasts a long time.  The tea tastes great and not bitter.  But of course, it all depends on the brewing time so keep that in mind.  The longer you brew it results in bitterness.  Also, the temperature of water also is a factor that can affect the taste.  I heat the water until its just about to boil.  That is the temperature that prevents the bitter taste.  Try this and enjoy it!

Tastes good. Not seeing or feeling energy part.

Light to mild on taste, great flavor. But this particular type (mate tea bag) is not necessarily my cup-of-tea.  Catch my joke.  Lol.  So far I've tried Cruz de Malta which I love😍 and now Guayaki in tea bag form.  In comparison, I feel as though, I must add 7-8 Guayaki tea bags just to equal strength of one brew from Cruz de Malta.  On my part, I haven't done any digging to see if Guayaki comes in brew form, if so, I'd probably prefer that over the tea bag form.Happy mate drinking everyone!  JoE =)

I drink mate every day.  I tried the Guayaki unsmoked and this at the same time.  I like this one better.  It's got a great taste with good packaging and good delivery speed.  I'm going to try others, but I suspect I'll be back to this exact one once I look around.  One mild complaint: it's ground pretty small.  I keep having to wipe off/clear my straw thingy (edit: I couldn't let that ignorance stand.  I meant bombilla).  The other kind I tried didn't have that problem.  Even so, I'm very happy with it and look forward to my morning mate every day.

Recommended by a friend and told that it tasted like grass.  To me it does, which is fine. I don't care for it with sweetener. Highly sensitive to caffiene, I used less than half of tea- so I'm probably missing out. Still, I like it.  Earthy, fresh. It's not "white bread" tea, and after reading reviews, was not surprised at the difference in texture.  One could always try snorting it.  Shipping was not good at all. Received 2 items in a box way too big, with 2 little air pillows, so tea was everywhere.  Not the products fault.  I get to experience a gentle pick me up with this tea, it's good hot and cold.  Thanks for all the reviews.

I didn't know what to expect. This is my first time purchasing loose leaf tea but this was better than expected. The powdered part gets through the little holes on my metal tea steeper.The packaging keeps it fresh and it has a strong flavor which to me means that it's not old.Only thing I wish they had was a resealable bag.Is you know your teas I  would recommend it.

I purchased this larger bag for a really great price. I've been buying a bag half the size for almost $11 at a health food store near me. Made the switch to yerba mate after Coffee started upsetting my stomach. I use two tea bags with honey and it seems to be almost the same as coffee. Trusted brand. Will continue to purchase.

Pleasant flavor, tried it for the first time. Doesjustice to me by keeping me awake and productive during the day without the gitters that I get from drinking coffee.I prefer to cold brew the tea and let it sit overnight in cold water and drink it in the morning and it get me going during the day.

Good mate. Not the most earthy flavor out there, but for prepackaged tea, it's delicious. I drink it daily and definitely notice a decrease in efficacy after extended use ... so I'll cut it off and then return. Mate is a great substitute for coffee and I happen to really enjoy the flavor. Some folks think it tastes like dirt, but I am not one of them, as I'm a fan of puh er tea as well.

I typically order tea in small portions, 100 grams at a time.  But a full pound?!  This is great stuff, but keep in mind you will get a FULL POUND of tea.  At two cups per morning, this will last a long time.  Ensure you use a very fine tea strainer or you will end up with lots of sediment at the bottom of your cup.  If you are using a Bombilla, its not even an issue.  Great stuff

Enjoy Mate tea (great caffeine boost without the coffee crash) and have tried a few different brands. Bought this brand as a loose leaf and enjoyed it, but found it difficult to use due to the ingredients were often difficult to keep out of the liquid. These work great and still get the same flavor and the bonus convenience of ease of use. Unless I find a better brand will likely keep these at home and in the office.

My new diet doesn't let me do coffee anymore but hasn't cured my insomnia, so here we are. Flavor is alright. Energizing properties are just okay. No heart burn like coffee as well, so thats cool.

Guayaki is the most common brand of maté on the market, and I bought it because of the good deal here.  Although there are more traditional brands out there with a much finer grind.  Other than that, I love maté. I totally kicked my coffee habit without really even trying. It gives you an alert feeling, but much different than from coffee- you won't be jittery at all.  Great for elimination, but totally not like a laxative at all.  Make it as strong as you possibly can!

Reminds me of green tea.  The tea bags have very fine powder in them, so there's grinds in the bottom of your cup.  I think I should have gone with loose leaf and steeped in myself.

I've been looking for affordable bagged Mate for a while, and this product is the perfect answer. Has the same flavor you'd expect from most unblended Mate, but in individual bags rather than loose. Great for travel or when you don't want another thing to clean. More than anything the price on Amazon is superb for 75 bags.The only downfall is they lack of strings on the bags, which may put some people off.

If you want the taste of Yerba Mate without the fuss of using the traditional gourd cup and strainer straw, then this product provides what you want--though the flavor is not as intense as the traditional brew.

It's alright. The taste is earthy and the caffeine level is average... seems on par with home-steeped green tea regarding caffeine. But take this with a grain of salt, I have a higher tolerance so if you know you're sensitive then it will probably affect you way more!!

bought this for a present and it was a good price vs what you pay in a store.

I bought this as a recommendation for energy and weight loss.  The contents are so finely processed you need to treat them like a coffee in a brewer than as a tea in an infuser as much of it will just end up in your cup or mug.  The shipper dI'd ship promptly and it arrived with only a couple of days instead of weeks.

Good tea. Too bad it has almost doubled in price. Will be looking for another variety.

I purchase this tea in hopes of finding something that could give me a jolt of caffeine without the associated reflux that I always get. I've heard it said that this tea is perfect to drink for that very purpose.... unfortunately, I got reflux just the same :(Back to caffeine pills for me.

I bought this tea to use for an "energy drink" recipe in a magazine.  Not so sure I would like the tea so well on its own, but I combine it with other teas for the caffeine and enjoy it.  I don't think I have seen it anywhere near this price.

I found this a pleasant substitute for the coffee and teas I've been drinking for a lifetime.  I just add coconut/almond milk to it and enjoy it.

Good stuff. My only issue is that the amount of tea in the bags seemed somewhat inconsistent. Every few bags I would pull one out and it would have noticeably less tea than the others. I've since bought a bag of the Guayaki loose leaf yerba mate and I like it better all around.

The caffeine content is not too distinct from a regular bagged Green Tea. I didn’t get the “fresh, natural” tea taste from it.

Will buy from seller again

Love this tea however I ordered 2 loose leaf tea and only received 1 16 oz the other was tea bags please send other I paid for thank you

This tea tastes pretty close to regular green tea. I didn't notice any huge increase in my energy, which has been suggested in some articles. Still, tea is generally good for health so I'll continue to drink it. I prefer this served with ice instead of hot.

Used it to make Kombucha, works well but I would not drink it hot, by it's self, tried it once, very bitter.

The tea has good depth of flavor and is smooth. I am enjoying it very much

Good value and goo Yerba Mate.  I use it to help with lung function and it seems to do the trick, Yerba Mate is known for having Theobromine.  It also gives a slight sustained energy boost which is nice

Taste is good, flavorful. The bags does not have holding string, so you will have to submerge them and take them out with a spoon (a little inconvenient). The container bag breaks really easily, I end up putting them in a zip lock bag.

Good stuff. I got what I ordered. I prefer yerba mate over any other energy drink.

I've never had this tea before but the flavor is very mild.

Started drinking it after hearing Tim Ferris drinks Yerba Mate.  This had good reviews which is why I chose this brand.I measure my blood sugar often and test what effects various foods and drinks have on it. - I'm prediabetic and trying to reverse it.  If I drink this tea alone on an empty stomach it will lower my blood sugar by approximately 14 points over the course of the following hour from when I first start sipping it.  For example, I would go from 100 down to 86. If I drink it with a meal it seems to suppress my blood glucose values slightly compared to when I eat the same food without drinking the Yerba Mate.I have consumed hundreds of cups over the last year or so and it has never once made me jittery.  The most I would have in a day is probably 2 tea bags.  I typically have 2 cups of decaf coffee first thing in the AM, then I have a cup or two of this tea after that.I will use one bag twice if I am having a second cup right after the first one.  The second cup will obviously be a little weaker but it is still satisfying.The tea seems to help calm me and focus me and help me get into "the zone" when I am doing creative work.  The effect is not strong.  It is very subtle.  So, don't drink it expecting a dramatic relaxation effect.I absolutely love the flavor.  It is very mild in my opinion.  To me it seems like the texture of the tea is almost as if you had a very small amount of butter in the tea cup.  (Not the taste of butter - just the texture - like silky almost)  I think it is just lovely.I have not been able to source this locally.  Someone local probably sells it but I haven't found it yet.  So I always buy it through Amazon.  It always arrives promptly in good condition.The large foil bag that these tea bags ship in is easy to tear.  You will probably want to have an airtight container of some kind to store your tea bags in.  The bag they ship in will probably end up tearing wide open on you before you get half way through the bag.I strongly recommend this tea.  Drinking this has become a daily habit for me.  At this point it looks like a permanent habit too assuming the quality never diminishes and assuming the price remains affordable.

UPDATED AS OF 3/3/24I had to chime in to dispel some of the intensely inaccurate reviews on here, in terms of what yerba mate is and isn't, and its benefits.First, technically yerba mate is an herb, not a tea, as it is not from the camellia family.  It's actually related to holly.Second, it contains vitamins, minerals, and more antioxidants than green tea (contrary to one misguided reviewer on here claiming that yerba only yields caffeine, which is not even close to the truth.)Yerba mate contains caffeine, theophylline (vasodilator) and theobromine (found in chocolate), but most who drink it find they do not experience the jitters, acid stomach or other negative aspects of coffee or green tea, myself included.I have found that yerba acts as a natural asthma medication for me, keeping my lungs open and giving me an energetic boost without feeling hyper, sweaty or keeping me from sleeping. In fact, I often take yerba before bed to keep the lungs happy all night and sleep like a baby. I cannot consume coffee or any tea (black or green) after noon and sleep at all, not even one cup. So clearly yerba is a special herb.It brews well in tea bags, in a traditional gourd and bombilla setup or in a French press.  Apparently in South America, they have it cold and brewed in fruit juice and similar things for a refreshing summer beverage. I cannot wait to try that! I've made yerba overnight in the fridge, cold-brewed, and it was delicious. Strong, but not bitter at all.Just wanted to correct some misinformation on here and share some of the reasons why yerba mate has been a treasured part of my life for 3 decades and counting!Original Review:I was introduced to Guayaki Yerba Mate by a tenant of mine in Los Angeles. He used to chuck a few tea bags into his 1.5 liter water bottle, shake it up and sipped it throughout the day for energy and the lovely flavor. I tried it and have been a huge devotee ever since. I like it sweetened with a touch of liquid stevia and I brew mine quite strong (so strong, you cannot see through the water, lol) because I adore the rich, smokey flavor which only seems to deepen when you add a little sweetness. I also noticed that while I do feel a little energy lift from it, I never feel jittery nor has it ever disrupted my sleep when I drink it in the evening. It honestly seems to help my digestion as well, I feel like it kindles the digestive flames somehow, but that might just be my own experience.Wonderful flavor, unobtrusive energy and a healthy substitute for coffee or "energy drinks".

No complaints with this tea. It doesn't pack a strong punch like coffee does as it's relatively low caffeine for this blend.

Bought this to preserve my dopamine neurons when I was using opiates. Seemed to help only the first day or so. But when I drank this tea and used opiates I was consistently using the same amount and could think better. Good taste and smell. Smooth quality. fresh taste. Will buy again soon.

I bought this as a recommendation for coffee substitute that wouldn't stain my teeth. I also purchased some Red Rooibos as well to compare the two. I have to say that while I did enjoy the Red Rooibos, it had that very distinct tea flavor, and just didn't quite hit the spot.The Yerba Mate came in a few days later, so yesterday was the first time I got to try it as a morning coffee substitute. While again, it's not going to taste like coffee, this stuff was much more like green tea, which isn't bad either, but definitely not like coffee.  I normally add a bit of heavy cream to my coffee, so I did that as well, and found I enjoyed it much more that way.Claims that the smaller amount of caffeine being enough (95mg in coffee vs 40mg in this product), held true for me, as well as the claim that it felt more like a consistent energy, rather than the hard hit that coffee can give, and then fades.Yesterday I had to get up at 5:30 am and drive 2 hours to get to a 4 hour conference. I then had to run a bunch of errands, followed by a 2 hour drive home. After 6 hours of sleep, things didn't seem promising. However, I found that I really wasn't very tired at all throughout the day, and it wasn't until around 3-4, after eating a solid meal, that I kind of started feeling the energy drain, but I was still pretty good all the way up to my evening exercises, after which, I just crashed, but it was 10 pm by then.So, given the initial trial run, I'd say the Yerba Mate IS a good substitute. Granted, it could be a whole fluke of a day, but for now, my opinion is that the taste is pleasant, and the slow and steady energy buzz is actually preferable to coffee. As far as claims of being a mild appetite suppressant, I haven't noticed that.Just a final heads up: a quick Google shows that there's a lot of pros and cons about Yerba Mate, including that it's better for you than coffee, with lots of vitamins and nutrients and anti inflammatory effects,  but also studies saying it can put you at a higher risk for some cancers if too much is ingested. I honestly haven't looked very far into it, but will be doing so once I'm done with this. Just so you know!UPDATE: Oct. 7, 2019 - Yerba Mate has consistently held up as a caffeine substitute for me. I now drink 2 tea bags added to 16 oz hot water and about 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream in the morning. My energy levels are comparable to coffee, and I'm usually not hungry till 11-12pm. I got this because it's not supposed to stain your teeth like coffee does, and I can say my teeth haven't stained any.

After doing research on black and green tea (real tea), I discovered that fluoride in the tea were actually at unsafe levels.  And that this could POTENTIALLY mean bad news for bones, teeth, and brain function.  I will leave you to do your own research on that, as I am generally NOT a worrier about such things (so I know how frustrating it is to hear yet another possible health risk.)  Still (obviously) I saw enough reason to be at least "concerned" at the levels of fluoride in black and green (and decaf) tea.  This led me to two new products: White Tea and Yerba Mate.Yerba Mate is a loose leaf traditional (south american) tea-like product that comes in many different forms.  And it doesn't have high concentration of fuoride in its leaves.  So, I tried it.I heard that it tastes "grassy" or like hay.  Some say it taste earthy.  To be sure, it doesn't taste like green or black tea (but more like green than like black).  It is unique.  I didn't find it "grassy."  I found it to have a pleasant, non-bitter taste.  Not like tea, as I said, but pleasant enough.I prepared it by putting it in my Mr. Coffee coffemaker.  FIrst batch tasted like coffee a bit.  I cleaned the coffee maker and tried again.  This time i got a pleasant brew.  I tried to make it STRONGER, the next time and I found no real difference.  So, I went back to normal brew.  It will look a little like green tea in looks, but it's unique taste was unmistakeable. I enjoyed it. My wife complained it had an odd taste.  However, my wife is self-proclaimed picky eater.  Even if she loves some recipe/item, then later finds out it has XYZ (whatever item she doesn't think she likes) then see will change her mind and never eat that food that she said that she loved.  All that to say this: If you are AOK with knowing this will have a unique taste, then you may just find it a good drink for you. If you are pretty picky about tastes that are new, then you likely will not like it.For me, I have to give it 5 stars.  Oh, to be sure, I like White Tea better than Yerba Mate, but it is a good product and worthy of 5 stars.

You Must buy !!!! If you're trying to get off of coffee ☕ this is the best.

I put in glass teapot cold overnight and I drink it all day. I love it!

I used to work at a tea house and this was the brand that most people loved drinking and it was very popular with taste when added with soy, honey and sugar. Even better if you can find mint syrup to add and taste amazing.

Just as good as I remember. More convenient than the traditional but they sell loose mate as well. I really like the flavor, but I don’t drink enough mate to know how it compares to other brands.

This is my favorite loose-leaf yerba so far. It has a potent amount of caffeine, coupled with a chocolatey after-taste. Guayki is the best :D

Heard about Yerba Mate on the Huberman Podcast. My coworkers and I are enjoying it.

My first introduction to Yerba Mate was a roommate telling me that the stuff is "crazy" and will keep you more awake than energy drinks or coffee. He bought the stuff as an iced tea from Whole Foods. I tried it and it did provide an energy boost, but not a "crazy" one.After some research, I found out that as a ballpark figure, Yerba Mate provides ~1/3 (one third) of the caffeine of a cup of coffee. That's perfect for me, since I don't always want as much caffeine as a full cup of coffee, but I do want *some.* I did some research, and it turns out they don't just sell it at Whole Foods in pre-made iced tea. So I bought it on Amazon.== Taste ==Yerba Mate has a smoky flavor to it. If you like drinking green tea or other teas without adding lots of sugar, you'll like this tea.== Price point ==... is absolutely ridiculous -- you get 75 tea bags. That lasts a long time.== No string attached ==If it's an issue for you, the tea does come in bags, but it doesn't have a string for easily pulling out the bag. It's really not very difficult to pull it out with a spoon, but it is worth mentioning since most people are used to having a string attached to their tea bags.== Good hot or cold ==At first, I had this tea mostly hot-brewed, and it was quite good. But recently, my girlfriend and I have started adding about 5-10 bags to a large pitcher of water and letting it soak in the fridge for at least 12 hours. It tastes **awesome.** So while Yerba Mate is good for hot tea, it is even better for cold tea. Some teas just taste better cold -- actually, that's true of food in general. Some things taste better hot; some better cold. Black tea is the one most commonly used in iced teas, like Snapple. You can drink it warm, but it's far more popular cold.I highly recommend this product, and I also highly recommend that you try using it to brew iced tea.

I drink a cup of the tea every day. Tasts great and only a tablespoon serving. It just costs more than in the store but the store is almost an hour away so I have to buy it online.

I really like this tea. When I feel down, I warm up this tea and it helps to boost my energy levels and mood. It is very concentrated to make lots of cups and it’s good to add cream and share with family.

I learned about yerba mate in Argentina, and bought Argentine Yerba, mate, and bombilla.  I later found out that Yerba is paraguayan. This product is.  The quality is also high (almost pure leaf, did not see any stems)

Everyone loves coffee but few people are as dedicated to the craft of finding and enjoying caffeine as I am. After having downed energy drinks twice a day for a few years, switching to coffee to try to get an equal, albeit uneven, fix, I'm happy to have found yerba mate tea.What I love most about the Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea is the elevated feel and focus the tea provides through its 40 mg of caffeine per bag without the traditional shaky hands and anxiety I would get from coffee and energy drinks. It's a buzz without being a wreck.For comparisons, Starbucks coffee (venti Americano) doses you with about 300 mg of caffeine though independent reports I've seen have shown it to be upwards of 400 mg+ depending on where you go. Energy drinks typically range from 77 mg (8 oz Red Bull) to 240 mg per can (16 oz Rockstar Zero Carb) with added, and unnecessary to get you going, things like taurine that are questionable for your health.With yerba mate tea, you can stack your caffeine to your content. Want the buzz of an energy drink without the nerves? Put four bags in and let it steep for 10 minutes. Works like a charm every time for me.It's worth noting that the U.S. government recommends not consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine per day so going overboard with two ventis from Starbucks or two Rockstars can have potential consequences. Beyond the simple enjoyable taste of yerba mate, the stackable nature is what I enjoy most.For the price, you can't go wrong! Four bags (160 mg of caffeine) gets you close to 19 cups of tea. When you compare that to $4 for a venti Americano or $3 for an energy drink, it's pretty apparent that yerba mate is also the more economical choice of the three.Check out energy fiend dot com to get the scoop on caffeine levels in each drink. I know I'm addicted to the alertness caffeine provides, as I'm sure most of us are, but there is no excuse not to be safe about how much we take in each day.

My husband loves this brand in drinks but honestly they add up buying the cans everyday , he is not a coffee drinker but needs the energy for his 10-12hr shift’s , and buying the pack of cans did not seem cost officiant either. I used to brew him other brands of Yerba Mate teas when we lived in San Francisco but could not find any strong ones in our area of Sam diego now . After looking around I came across this loose leaf tea one and honestly it’s been great , the taste is strong and not flavorful  as the Can ones but it also does not say it is lol , what I do is buy sweet flavor loose teas at my local farmers market that don’t have caffeine so I don’t add more and give the man a heart attack , also can use tea puches and ass a bit of honey or sugar to each it’s own for some sweetness . Works great and he has more flavor options than the canned ones , also Have the option to make it as strong or light  as he wants with many different flavor options , make a big pitcher that last all week and is ready to make it iced in a hydro flask . Overall GREAT purchase , money saver .

I am hooked on this smooth as silk tea.  Have been drinking it for years after tasting it at a Yoga health a wellness center.  It is so delicious and has many variations to indulge in.  Cold, hot, your choice.  What are you waiting for?

I used to drink coffee at 3:00 each day but this is my new go to pick me up. A cup of yerba mate tea is delicious and soothing. It is delicious just as it is and doesn’t need sweetener.

Been using this brand of Yerba Mate for years. I like it even better since I’ve been gifted a 8.3” Bombilla straw with a heatproof silicone tip which is great, no French press and no straining!

Great brand. Always. Never a complaint.

I love this tea, my favorite tea! I received exactly what I order and pretty quick.

We did not have any idea how this would taste. It is very good.

This stuff is hard to explain.It seems most similar to green tea, but it has an earthier taste, nuttier maybe. I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green "tea" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste.

Over the years I’ve been developing more of a taste for teas.  One day I came across an article talking about the benefits of this particular tea.+ Loaded with all kinds of vitamins, mineral, and antioxidants+ Boost your immune system+ Help increase energy and mental focus (mainly due to the caffeine)I’ve only had this warm.  I prepare it by heating up water then throwing 1-2 packets into my giant mug, then slowly stir it for about 2-3 minutes.  My first few sips of it weren’t bad, but not great.  Overtime though I did like the grassy/earthy taste it has.  Noticeably different than any other varieties of tea I’ve ever had!  If you’re not into such a strong taste, try diluting it a bit!Whenever I drink Yerba Mate Tea I definitely notice a decent boost of mental clarity, but different than if I were to just drink a ton of coffee and get a huge rush from the caffeine.  Furthermore since there is much less caffeine in Yerba Mate Tea (40mg) compared to coffee (100-120mg) I don’t ever experience a crash from the caffeine and I feel alright drinking this at night and not have to worry about staying up all night.For 75 bags the price isn’t too shabby, but if you’re strictly after caffeine content I probably look to a combination of coffee and green / black tea for the best bang for your buck.  As for those seek a little more variety in their caffeine, this is a wonderful selection!

Stuff will give you a buzz!

For several years I have enjoyed drinking Yerba Mate tea. When my coffee consumption started to get out of hand, I was looking for an alternative that didn't leave me crashing in the afternoon. A friend suggested I try Yerba tea because it has been around for hundreds of years, is a natural source of caffeine, has digestive benefits, all without the afternoon crash.  At the time, I could only find Yerba tea in health food stores. Each time I ran out of a box (usually around 20 tea bags), I would have to trek to the store for more. I'm not a fan of the Yerba teas with added stevia, vanilla, or the "smoked" flavor. When I found this Guayaki brand on amazon, I thought 75 tea bags for $11 would certainly sacrifice flavor for cost. But I was wrong! I love the tea - and it has successfully kept me from returning to my coffee over-addiction :)  The tea steeps for about 5 minutes. I put the tea bag into my mug and use my Keurig machine for instant hot water. I like to add some honey, and occasionally some milk or cream. By itself, it can be a little strong on an empty stomach, but green tea is also too strong for me on an empty stomach. I never have that coffee crash, and my mind actually feels clearer than with coffee.I would highly recommend this Guayaki Yerba Mate tea - for the taste & for the money! It's a great deal!!

I like it the tea because you coming in time

For $11.25 or 15 cents per packet at time of purchase for a total of 75 bags of tea this is a great deal.When I look for tea I generally look for three things: price, taste, and health benefits. Guayaki Yerba Mate tea is very cheaply priced online as described earlier and all you have to do is walk the aisles at your grocery store to see that. In terms of taste, it is actually derived from a plant of the same name in South America and is actually a species of Holly. It is somewhat like an earthier green tea with a slight (pleasant) bite depending on how you brew it.Health wise, I drink it every morning and it helps wake me up without the rise and fall that regular coffee provides, and like most fresh brewed hot tea I find it personally mellows me out and helps me get ready to face the challenges of the day. Additionally, it has helped regulate my digestion and overall just made me feel slightly better overall. When I got a head cold a steaming cup of Yerba Mate helped clear up my sinuses although I've found most hot teas will do the same, though I will qualify these statement with the fact that I am not a doctor and haven't done any studies, these are just my personal observations.I definitely plan on rebuying this tea when my current supply runs out.

I recently tried Guayaki Yerba Mate and LOVE it so very much.Having recently undergone major GI surgery I am no longer allowed processed sugars of any type which also effect what I can and cannot eat.Guayaki Yerba Mate has taken care of my cravings for chocolate thanks to the tea containing the same compounds found in chocolate without the added sugars, fats and other ingredients found in processed chocolates. Also it does not cause any GI upset to my stomach thanks to a very love tannin level.I make mine hot in the morning for as my eye opener.I also Sun brew for sipping throughout the day. My husband chuckles when he opens the refrigerator and see my stash of the 4 1/2 gallon  mason jars filled to the brim with sun brewed Yerba Mate.. I sip on cold Year Mate throughout the day. I am one of the few that caffeine does not cause sleeplessness in, thankfully.The flavor of Yerba Mate is very refreshing and similar to a green tea yet does not give the flavor of the grassy flavor much like a sencha green tea.If you are watching the calories and crave the chocolate euphoria this will fulfill that craving without the calories as well as give you a nice pick me up.

He specifically asked for this tea. Less expensive than on their web site.

Yerba Mate picks me up but does not result in "tea hangover."

I’ve been trying to find a similar option to what I used in Southern Brazil. This product is exactly what I wanted and brings back some great memories from that time in South America.

every morning with a bit of honey starts my day off right

This tea is very yummy and easy to make with tons of flavor

Other reviewers have mention the fine particles in Guayaki Loose Yerba Mate, but all the Yerba Mate I've tried had some fine particles, and this does not bother me. Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and "on edge" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in
Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag
, so if the fine particles bother you, the bags may be a better choice.

I've been using this Guayaki Traditional Organic Yerba Mate' either in bags (however, pretty sure, not organic in that form) or in loose leaf pretty regularly over the past about thirty years. Lately, we have been using this loose leaf mate exclusively as our first tea of the morning, and, prior to any coffee. I really like the flavor -- rich and full. If there's more left, as usually the case in the glass pot I use, I pour over more hot water, use this way -- and/or use the leftovers to make a great iced tea, sweetened or unsweetened. I find that mate' is far gentler on my stomach and likewise, on the nervous system, than our good ol' coffee we love. Have reduced my coffee from two to one rich cup later in morning. By the way, I've tried other brands of mate' over the years -- anyway, a few -- and keep coming back to this. Don't need to try others anymore -- no point.

This tea is great for waking up your brain and centering on focus for me,  some days in the late afternoon, this is what is needed.  I don't drink it everyday and it doesn't make you crash like coffee.  It's a subtle refresh. The taste is woodsy, I don't love that but I can tolerate it for the effect I get.

If you haven't tried Yerba Mate and you are a coffee drinker you are really doing yourself a disservice. I started drinking it to replace coffee about 6 months ago and this stuff is beyond what I expected. I've even managed to lose about 10 lbs because of it! It keeps me awake and active through the day without the uncomfortable jitters and sugar crashes that came as a result of over consumption of coffee. I've tried two different brands now and guayakí is my favorite so far. If you have never tried it I suggest trying it in a can before you dive in and buy the loose leaf. The loose leaf is by far the better value (even better than the tea bags) but has a little more of an earthy flavor. I've never been a huge fan of tea but I can't get enough of this stuff. It is seriously the best. If you are skeptical please take this review as your extra push to give it a try you won't regret it!!

Good ratio between sticks and the dust. Not overly bitter. More cost effective, 1/2-3/4 cup of this gourd is enough to keep my alert for the full day. Definitely a must for those looking for a coffee alternative.There was a slight tear in the bag so dust came out

The best Yerba Mate around!

Absolutely love this tea! I have been an avid coffee drinker for over a decade, and as I have gotten older it has started to give me some stomach issues due to it's acidity. I was looking for a switch because I still love having a cup of something warm in the morning. This was the perfect substitute as it also gave me a bit of a caffeine kick.To brew I use my coffee maker like normal but don't put any coffee beans in. I put a travel mug underneath with two bags and set the alarm for the AM. I let it steep for 10 minutes or so then add a bit of agave and lemon. Easy on the stomach, tastes great, gives me a caffeine kick and I know I am getting a bunch of antioxidants in the morning. Already on my second bag!

I am newly OBSESSED with this tea. I stopped drinking coffee because it made me feel anxious. I replaced it with this. It’s so comforting and I enjoy the heck out of it every morning. It literally makes my morning! I drink it plain and I don’t get jitters or anxious feeling. It’s my happy drink

I have never heard of this tea before.  My doctor found out that I was a caffeine junkie and advised me that I needed to kick the habit.  OMG!  How could I ever do such a thing.  So I let my fingers do the walking and found this product.  Ok....what would I have to lose.  A few dollars and cents.  So, I ordered Yerba Mate.  I opened the bag, smelled it and yuck....smelled like dirt.  I as expecting the worst.  My first cup was surprising yummy.  I have been drinking it now for several months.  I kicked the caffeine without killing anyone.  My morning cup-o-joe is no mo. (more)  I agree with the reviewers that this tea may be an acquired taste.  It is different but I have enjoyed it very much.  It also tends to curve my appetite which is always a good thing.  Give it a try.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I love this tea!!! I take it to work and enjoy it at home. It has just enough caffeine, helps curb your appetite naturally, and taste great. I love the tea bag version so I can take it with me any where I go. It has become harder to find lately. I was able to find it at Whole Foods but it's hit or miss lately. I have tried other Yerba mate brands and I always come back to this one. Just Love It! ❤

I developed a caffeine intolerance but Yerba mate doesn't bother me the way coffee or sodas do. From what I've read the chemical make up is different in Yerba Mate (YM) compared to caffeine in other drinks.What I absolutely love about YM is that it gives a slight energy boost & even a happiness without the jittery feeling & you won't have a crash after an hour or so as with regular caffeinated drinks. Don't misunderstand though, it doesn't bring you up if you are sad. I've tried triple doses to test this but on a regular day it adds a bit of a skip to your step. :)The flavor isn't much to be desired but add a little local honey (which is extremely good for fighting allergies) & it will grow on ya.I do not ever want to be without my YM. Just wish I could find it locally since I use a 75 count bag in about a month.

I love mate, and this is very tasty! I love this brand's smoky, earthy, herbal flavor that is never bitter whether it's hot or cold.  Usually when I wake up I drink it hot with no sugar, and it gives me a nice boost in the day without giving me a jittery feeling.  When it's hot, I make a pitcher of this iced, with sugar, a spoonful of rosewater, and a squeeze of lime. Yeah, it's not traditional at all, but it is so good! :)This package contains 75 teabags.  The bags don't have strings and are not individually packaged, which I like because it cuts down on waste.  If you know what mate tastes like and drink it regularly, this is an economical purchase.  If you haven't tried mate before, I'd suggest getting a smaller sized pack at first because it doesn't taste like tea.

Been a really helpful replacement for coffee

I purchased this tea several months ago. I use it occasionally in place of coffee. It may be an acquired taste, as it taste like liquid grass from your yard to me. However I steep two bags in a cup of hot water for several minutes. Squeeze out the water and add a little bit of milk. The Taste is not terribly objectionable it's just different. However the desired effect for me is to have a caffeine boost or a little bit of stimulant boost. This will do that because it has caffeine in it, however the way it works is not the sudden onset of the jitters like a strong cup of coffee can do. This is more gradual and without really a crash when it wears off. So I highly recommend that you try it and see how it works for you.

Like alot of people have shared this tea is so weak in taste. I'm sad I paid $8 for this. I'm trying two bags together now to see if I can even use this. Using one bag, is like trying to squeeze a second round out of a tea bag. It's that weak and not worth spending any more money on. I won't even try any other of this company's tea's because of this.

The ingredients are not listed on this item online. It is horrible and not chai. It is made with a hemp bag that gives it a flavor and in the tea bag the ingredients are licorice root, ginger root, fennel and cinnamon bark, and cardamom pod & vanilla. Licorice and fennel are not in chai.

Box was crushed

Seriously creates a vomiting reflex drinking this tea. Really bad

I love your tea.....but it looks like I'll  be buying elsewhere... Not paying for your tea,not at that price

Such a weak flavor tea even after the full 15 minute steep time. As someone said, as strong as chamomile. It's really strange.Pass on this if I were you.

I steeped for almost 15 minutes and it still had the color of slightly dirty dishwater. No fragrant smell and barely any taste at all. Will not purchase again.

Just about the worst sip of tea i've ever had. Probably half my fault because I expected this to be a black tea. But ouch.

How do I get my money back for such a terrible product when they are not eligible for return?Every bag splits!!!

Should have labelled as Cinnamon Tea rather than Vanilla Tea.  It does taste vanilla at all. I am totally disappointed.

Weak and nasty taste, not my cup of tea at all

No taste

This product tasted vile. It does not contain any tea leaves so is just a herbal blend. I tried adding milk and it was awful. I do not recommend this product at all.

I love Pukka tea, but this Vanilla Chai is tasteless.  Maybe a bad batch.  Had high hopes & wasn’t past the expiration date.

I’m not a fan of licorice flavor in my chai as it overpowers everything else. This tea has a really strong licorice flavor and wasn’t spicy at all.

This actually isn't chai at all.  Chai is a type of spiced Indian tea.  This is a spice infusion that has only spices and no tea at all of any kind.  I infused it in warm milk and used in in a cup of actual tea and it was pleasant.  It might be useful to infuse cider or wine but I have not tried this.  But as a drink by itself I found it watery and insipid.

I was looking for lovely chai tea but this was too mild and not strong enough. I bought a box of Twinings' Chai tea and they were lovely!

To me it tastes too much of cinnamon, in fact it overpowers other ingredients. I can't bring myself to drink it.

Brought for my husband, but he did not like it. Says he prefers the ordinary Chai.

don't like a taste of it

It tastes to strong of licorice

It doesn't taste like much BUT if you can add a slice of fresh ginger to the cup, it's really good and worth buying.

Not so fresh

This is a fabulous tea, but Amazon fulfillment should know to send this in a box and not a padded envelope. This was meant to be part of a gift, but I can’t give it to someone now that it is smashed and open. Please ship this tea in a hard-sided box. Thanks!

Pukka is one of the best organic teas on the market.  I''m a huge Chai fan, however this Chai was a little too mellow for me.

Delicious, though it took well over a month to receive.

Pricey, but very nice.

I am bit confused. It says that it is a vanilla tea, but there is no tea in it. Also it smells like cinnamon, taste like it and have 40% of it, only 4% of vanilla. But still I like it. It's spicy and warms me up.

I love the chai tea, so maybe Im picky... first of all, is a taste that not many people will like, is a bit spicy and very different to all other teas...  I didnt give the 5 stars because I like a more intense flavor, Im not from india anyway, so not an expert, but is very good anyway.

I use this tea to make chai bubble tea and the flavour is amazing. Not sure it’s worth the price for how few teabags you get, so wouldn’t recommend for regular drinkers.

You can smell the mouth watering warm scent of cinnamon and vanilla waft through your house when you make this tea, it is delicious and delicious and even more delicious. Totally recommend it.

tasty, especially if you brew a cup and then leave the rest to seep overnight you have a lovely vanilla drink the following day.

I would buy this again. It is quite refresing. Only down side is it smells kind of funky before it's made into a cuppa.

This tea is like a dessert on its own! The spices give a beautiful smell when you open the box.

This is just what I was hoping it would be. It is a very tasty decaf chai tea. Perfect for a non-stimulating evening cuppa.

Really like the flavors and easy to order from Amazon

This is so so good!!!

This is  a great tea with a pleasing taste

I love pukka tea. I was glad it arrived quickly and I am enjoying every sip.

I sleep well at night

Excellent and delivered on time

Amazing tea and great delivery time. No complaints here. Great Overall I think the Pukka Tea is one of my favorite herbal teas around. It’s tasty, satisfying and warming. Usually I find herbal teas can smell a lot better than they taste, but I have to say this one follows through. I would happily drink it any time or day, and it might even start to push my old favorite Early Grey out on occasion.Vanilla chai is excellent for warm pick me ups in place of earl grey

That says it all.

this tea is soo good! im addicted, gonna buy more. it really doesn't even need honey or anything to sweeten it unless you are they type to add some sweet to your tea then it will definietly taste good as well!

I really like the flavor of this tea.  It’s decaffeinated and wonderful in the evening to relax before bed.

Pukka Tea's never disappoint. Love the flavor, love the box, love how it makes me feel.

A lovey beverage addition to our office "coffee bar". It smells and tastes wonderful

A friend loved the gift I sent her. It was smashed when it came tho it was fine long as the inside stayed good

Wife had this tea in England and loved it.

This tea is amazing, even if it did ship all the way from England

Love the tea unique awesome flavor

Great product. My favorite Chai.

YUMMY

Great taste without the caffeine.

SO DELICIOUS. Not overpowering, just a simple, sweet drink.

fast and yummy as always

Great tea!

I don't usually like chai, but this was really good! Highly recommend.

When my husband was in Scotland this summer I had him pick me up a few boxes of Pukka teas to try. I am not really a chai fan so was pleasantly surprised that out of the 8 or so flavors I tried, THIS was my favorite! It does not have the usual "bite" of a chai tea and that is what I like about it. Still spicy, but nice and smooth. I'm here to purchase more!

Discovered in Paris, missing in Italy. Delicious!

If you like tea this is a good Chai tea to getI would definitely buy from them againThe seller was really good, no shipping problemsIf you like buying tea this is a good company to buy fromI'll buy from them again

Love this so much. I love that it's organic. Have tried Numerous Pukka Teas I'm never let down. I put a cinnamon stick in with the tea for an extra cinnamon kick. Love, love , love! 🙌🏻

Delicious and doesn’t bother my stomach!

Amazing aftertaste....the tea has very little flavour of vanilla but strong cinnamon, fennel and mulethi flavour. I loved this tea and have ordered it again. Perfect as a dessert after meals, this tea leaves you refreshed and happy. Tastes best when steeped for 5-8 min.

Great tea.

Really refreshing Tea flavour..price a little on the higher side but still makes you feel royal and perfect for the me time drink...Although mentions Vanilla- it has strong cinnamon accent which adds depth to thebrew.I am ready to buy in bulk- but very expensive.

Creamy and warming, i have these with no milk but you can add to this teabag if you want.

Love it

The spice mix in this particular chai is smooth and relaxing

Thank you for the product.

Exactly what I expected and quock delivery

Delicious!

My neighbour loves this Pukka Herbs chai tea so I purchased it for when she pops in for a cuppa

Overpriced here on Amazon (usually around £2.50 in shops) but flavour wise one of my favourite herbal teas. I let the bag sit for at least 10mins before adding in some stevia and some Meadow Churn 10% coffee cream. Reminds me of eggnog without the calories or sugar. Not as tasty au natural but that's just my taste buds perhaps.

Lovely, warming Chai tea. The vanilla adds a gentle sweetness. Vanilla is great for supressing the appetite, so I always have a cup if I am feeling peckish between meals. Defintiely will buy again.

Absolutely love this tea. I'm usually a coffee drinker but now I'm hooked on this. It smells lovely and the cinnamon warmth is perfect for a cold day.

Great for a evening of relaxation

I ordered the 4 pack box and got the 1 pack

I buy this tea from the supermarket all the time. Unfortunately at the moment it was unavailable and so in a moment of tiredness and taking lockdown into consideration I ordered this.It is very overpriced by comparison and also on examining the box of tea on arrival it is not the same as you would buy in the UK. On one side of the box it is completely written in French.

While grateful the teas were still in their tiny little packets, the boxes arrived completely destroyed.

Tea Boxes were shipped in plain brown envelope. Boxes were crushed but filters were not damaged.

It got delivered on time and price was reasonable. But it did not taste as good as the one I already have

They don't taste or smell right or like the ones I normally buy.. just a bit off

Too mild. Not sure if the tea was old or stale but there was almost no flavour.

Refreshing three mint bio Pukka tea that I find helps my digestion after dining !  ' Thank You '

Very nice, fresh tea.  Flavorful but not overpowering.

Very tasteful mint tea; I do add a bit of honey to make it sweet; nice aroma; great packaging.

I found Pukka teas at, of all places, Marshall's. Of course, after finding that I loved the tea and wanting more, Marshall's didn't carry it anymore. I was so thrilled when I found it on Amazon. This is probably my favorite mint tea. It's not overly "minty"; no overwhelming peppermint taste, and a lovely separmint taste left after you drink it. Not to mention, it's great for an upset stomach.Add a little creamed honey if you want a dessert-like taste. By the way, the other Pukka teas are quite tasty too.

Very tasty. and healthy! Organic also!

keep this in my home all the time

this is a regular favorite in our office.

My daughter loves mint tea with a passion...and suffers from tummy aches periodically.  We have tried various brands and types of mint teas, and have found this Pukka blend of mints (organic peppermint, spearmint, and field mint) to be the VERY best of them all!  This tea has not only helped her with tummy pains, but if any of our family of 10 gets sick with stomach pains that is typically one of the first things we use!  Thank you Pukka for being absolutely wonderful and true to your word of all that is written inside the box, "Inside every sachet sits some of the world's finest herbs" and I truly believe it does!

Was concerned about buying this as im not s lover of herbal tea's. They always smell far better than they taste.This one however is really nice its not too over powering with the mint taste.Also highly recommended for anyone with tumcmy troubles like IBS.

I have tried many varieties of mint tea and find this is the one with the most taste

Lovely variation on mint tea. Nice to know that it's organic and every sale includes a donation to a good cause.

Lovely tea, very refreshing and calming. Purchased for my husband as was recommend it for blood pressure problems and he has been very happy with it. Also nice with ice:)

Excellent for calming a digestive upset. Very Minty tea and pleasant to drink.

This is one of the best kinds of teas that I've had in my life. I've subscribed to it because I absolutely love it! Over the years, I've taken it with me on trips and my assignments in remote locations -- it has a great effect and simply brings me peace of mind. If you love mint tea, this is the one.

I love my teas (especially mint) and this is one of the best. Refreshing and zingy! Really does the trick after a long day at work!

Nice

Love it!

thank you! loved the detox sample as welldelivery was prompt and all contents were safe.

Super tea

Excellent tea, excellent delivery

I love this tea and wanted to give some as a gift. This box was shipped in an envelope, which means the box got crushed during delivery and is no longer fit to give as a present. Not acceptable as a gift!

This product is described as "20 sachets" there were on 18!

the herbal teas arrived with the boxes broken half open the sachets all crushed and in two packs Two filters were missing there were 18 instead of 20

Tastes nothing like the Aveda tea. Not even close. Tastes like poison (I’m assuming that’s what poison tastes like)

Flavor was bland.  Wanted more full bodied.

it's not what I expected, didn't like it. "Not my cup of tea", so to speak.

I have been drinking Pukka teas from a few months now and noticed that licorice is an ingredient present in almost all of their teas.  The FDA has recently warned that licorice can cause heart problems--as little as two cups a day for weeks can cause a heart attack.  It is so irresponsible to sell these teas with licorice in nearly every one---and no the little one line warning on the bag stating no to drink too much because of hypertension isn't enough!!

It was suppose to be a box of 6!!Only one broken box arrived

The description of my order from the amazon website said it was six boxes with 20 teabags each. What I received was one broken box. Lol.

Ordered one case (6 boxes) and received one box only.  Ordered Feb 20 and received March 11.  Had to follow up for refund of 5 boxes shorted).

Never tried Pukka before, not blaming the seller, but I found it really weak tea, no matter how long you steeped it.  No more for me.

Pretty disappointed in this actually. Heard some buzz and decided to try it... The packaging is pretty! But it completely oversells what's inside. Frankly the tea was pretty bland and flavorless. Unlikely to buy again.

Really wanted to like it, but it was far too sweet for me.  I'm a big fan of both peppermint and licorice, but apparently the licorice root just has too much natural sweetness for my taste.

To me this takes nothing like peppermint. And nothing like Licorice.

left a really bad aftertaste in my mouth

The first time I had a cup of peppermint & licorice tea was from my meditation class and it was delish.  So, of course, I immediately wanted to get some.  I went to Publix, Walmart, so I didn't have to wait for a shipment, but I was only able to get it from Amazon, and was happy to get it.  I do enjoy it, but it just isn't quite the same as the first cup.  I'm wondering if they also carry another peppermint & licorice tea that may be the actual tea I had the first time.  I shared this with my friend, and she loves it!

If you like licorice, you will enjoy this tea.However the herbals are very faint. To taste the peppermint and licorice, I use at least two teabags at a time. Someone else might prefer more. For a 20 count box, be aware that the tea will get used up faster.

I couldn’t taste the licorice in this tea even when I put two teabags in my cup.

I don’t like the peppermint and licorice combination. The cinnamon and licorice flavor is much better.

Flavor, was not special. Would not buy again.

I like this tea.  The flavor is refreshing, strong and fresh tasting.  However, for me there is probably too much licorice, or maybe it just naturally over-powers the mint.If you like a little mint with Licorice then you will probably like this tea.

I love this tea. It's got a naturally slightly sweet taste from the licorice and the mint is so complimentary. However, I can't seem to find it for a normal price. Maybe it's discontinued? If the price doesn't go down from $12, I will have to find an alternative.

Wayyyy less strong/sweet than tea pigs. Still good just not as strong. So if you like tea pigs, stick w that, if tea pigs is too strong, then this is the one for you

These were very interesting. The tea turned out a bit weak so I ended up using two tea bags per cup but whatever. Definitely worth a try.I definitely didn’t dislike them, the flavor was just not for me. Makes me want to try other unusual kinds of tea.

I decided to give this tea a try after reading about it on a blog I follow. The product arrived within a week or so even though it had to travel across the pond, Great Britain to the States. The taste is delightful, but it could be slightly stronger for my taste.

A good tea.

This was similar to a sweet mint tea. The taste was okay. I would have liked a more pronounced licorice flavor.

It was pretty good but not great.  Like of an odd blend of flavors for me.

Enjoyable new tea flavor.

Love this tea

I don't use milk or sweetener, the licorice provides enough sweetness.

Good

This is the most delicious drink. It also provides a rather comforting  and healthy alternative to coffee. Try it you will not be disappointed

ok

Peppermint and licorice at first glance don’t seem to pair well, but that’s wrong. It is an excellent pairing and now one of my favorite teas.

Love this tea.

I really like Pukka teas.  The are delicious.

Such a nice sweet flavor that helps with sugar cravings

This is a delicious licorice flavored tea. Very subtle. If you have ever been to an Aveda salon and had their tea, this is as close to it as you’re going to come. For about 1/4 of the price. Delivery is fairly quick and comes in a very cute package. I have re-ordered this several times. With winter coming, it’s one of those comfortable things to have a cup of tea and curl up with a good book in the afternoon.

This is a perfect night time tea for me.  It's flavor is rich and delish and there's no caffeine to keep me awake.

We really like this tea.  I also put a teaspoon of honey in before poring boiling water in and then putting the tea bag in.  It tastes sooo good!  Highly recommended!

I am a picky, avid tea drinker. I don't like bland, and I can't stand teas that are "natural" with intense flavor that  comes from I-don't-want-to-know-where. I just want herbs. In tea. This tea is sweet, the aftertaste is so delicious. I know that when I drink this, it adds to my health in a real way. More than I can say for a lot of tea brands out there. I paid 9 bucks for this, I think it's worth it for sure (and I'm a cheapskate). To be honest, I don't want you to know how good it is..because I'd like to have an Amazon warehouse-ful of tea.. just for me.I haven't tried any of the other offerings by Pukka, but I intend to very soon.

I drink this as a form of "dessert" because the licorice provides a subtle sweetness, the peppermint is right underneath the sweetness.  I don't really get a strong licorice flavor, just a hint in the finish.It's really good, you should try it.Highly Recommended!

This is great after dinner organic tea. The licorice really relieves the stress and the peppermint pairs beautifully with the licorice.

The flavor is amazing and will cure any upset stomach with the combination of peppermint and wonderful licorice.

This particular flavor is my absolute favorite. The combination is sweet and satisfying.  I don't even add sweetness because it is not needed!

This year is refreshing and sweet-tasting. I absolutely love it. If you like licorice you will like this.

I love this tea. I never liked licorice so I never would have thought I would like a licorice and peppermint tea but the flavor is so nice.  Very mild and lightly and naturally sweet.  This tea is very good for when you have a couph or sinus issues. I love having a cup when I'm winding down for bed.

Pukka is one of those brands that offers tea in a natural bag that doesn't leak plastics when seeped in hot water (as too many tea brands do). This flavor is sweet, with no added sugar or sweetener - and warmly refreshing.

Discovered this tea at Publix but no longer carry it locally. So thrilled I can order on Amazon. Best tea on earth for me! No caffeine but lively flavor that soothes my nerves and is sweet without calories or artificial sweetening. Love it!

I heard about this tea on a podcast. This is my favorite flavored tea - and I’ve convinced several of my friends to try it, too.

A wonderful after dinner tea.

I bought this tea after reading the reviews saying it is similar to the Aveda Salon tea. It really is good. Nice flavor and it does remind me of Aveda tea but at a much better price. I've noticed that this brand is hit-or-miss with the strength of a flavor and this is one of the better ones. I recommend trying it without any sweetener first.Its actually better without. So great for someone staying away from sugar and still wanting flavor.

My mom kept seeing references to peppermint and licorice tea in some book she was reading. She was very curious about it, so I did an amazon search and came up with this product. I surprised mom with it... and she loves it! So much that I've bought a second box for her. Both times,the product arrived much sooner than the arrive-by date. I'm very happy with the service, and mom is very happy with the tea. Win-win.

Listen…. I don’t like tea, or licorice or peppermint… but someone told me this tea was great to cure sweet cravings. I CANT BELIEVE HOW DELICIOUS IT IS! Seriously! I look forward to having a cup each night before bed now.

Three sips in and I had to order another box. I do NOT like tea, but I love this. Nice, mild, sweet mint flavor on the sip with a hint of anise aftertaste. Thin/watery, but good. Beautiful and mild... if you're looking for a black licorice bite, then look elsewhere.

I wish it was easier to find this in the US. I bought this and had it sent from England. That's okay though, well worth the wait. However I need to stock up because it turns out everyone at home ended up loving it just as much as me, so one packet lasted about a week! Love love love. Sweet and perfect after food!

Read about this flavor tea in a mystery novel, sounded good so I searched it out.At Amazon naturally! Try it you'll love it.

If you are looking for high quality ingredients, plain and simple, this is for you.  It is just licorice root and peppermint.  There are no added flavors and it is not sweetened.  I love it and go out of my way to find it wherever I can because it is not sold in my local supermarket.I have also met people who strongly do not like this tea.  If you tend to like Celestial Seasonings, which is engineered with lots of flavors for the average palate, you may not like this tea.

Good value & great flavor.

I LOVE this tea.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it's just been perfect.  I tried Stash mint licorice tea and it was all mint.  You have a customer for life.  Thanks!

I love this tea. My daughter and family like it too. It is sweet tasting; great for after a meal.  The packaging is so pretty. Follow the instructions for brewing for the best taste. I am sending it in a package of Christmas gifts this year.

I love this tea. Sweet but herbaceous always. It's amazing hot or iced. Really calms me after a hard day and good for those trying to quick the sugar dragon. Highly recommended. Also doesn't have stevia like other licorice teas.

Can’t find it in stores anymore. So delicious

Wonderful sweet treat before bed without adding any extra calories

Not a licorice fan but LOVE this flavor combo!!

If you are a tea lover.. you must try this.  It is fantastic. It smells so much like licorice!  It was recommended to me by a friend who loves teas. (I am trying to cut back on dessert) and this is a great dessert tea with no sugar or honey of course.

THIS IS A REALLY NIFTY, NOT OVERWHELMING COMBO OF FLAVORS.

I love this tea. It’s the only one I’ve tried that tastes the best and helps my stomach the most

Full but subtle taste.  Perfect.

The peppermint licorice tea is the best! Naturally sweet without sugar, it helps curb my sweet tooth. This reminds me of the tea at Aveda salons and a similar peppermint licorice tea that Central Market used to carry but has apparently discontinued. This will be my new go-to!

I think I'm in the minority when I say for me the licorice taste definitely takes a backseat to the peppermint. This is still a really good tea and I would definitely buy again.

Love this tea! I was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed this tea. I ended up purchasing a few other flavors from this company and have been pleasantly surprised.

This the best tea I have had in my life. It is the perfect combination of flavors with a slight sweetness from the licorice so no other sweetener is needed. Great hot and iced.

Peppermint with licorice - did not think I would like. I love it

This is a wonderfully smelling tea.. The flavor is peppermint and licorice, the taste is of both. No sugar needed as the flavor is sweet.  A calming enjoyable cup of tea in the morning or evening.

my husband & I wind down our day with the Pukka teas ,we love them!!

I love this tea as it is two of most favorite flavors - licorice and peppermint. I usually drink before bedtime.

Love this tea.  I am a huge licorice fan and this tea really delivers.  Linging long after you have swallowed - nice full robust flavor.  Really enjoying it.  Thank you!

This is super flavorful. Very equivalent to Yogi or Aveda’s version.

Not an easy combo to find but glad they make it!

I just think the tea is delicious.  I love it.  Especially a cup before I go to bed.  Thank you for a great product.

The tea is great. I don’t recommend buying it from Amazon. They sent the wrong tea and won’t replace it or let me return it. I have not opened the box of tea.

Doesn’t taste the same as the boxes I get in the grocery store. These have a “burnt plastic” almost gassy after taste.

Customer should not waste hard earned money on this product...Worst sleep ever.Want a FULL REFUND!

I hate mint, and I won't drink or eat anything with it, and this is basically mint tea with some notes of other flavors, rather than tasting like passionflower.

I'm assuming I'm having an individual reaction to the ingredients such as Valerian root, but this tea keeps me awake 🤦‍♀️ No issues with this tea company in general. They are high quality tea for a great price.

Though I do not have smooth good night sleep, I usually sleep around 11:00-11:30 PM.  When I received this product, I was looking forward for a good night sleep.  I use three tea bags and drank them at 7:00 PM.  At 11:00 PM, I was wide awake. It kept me awake until almost 4:00 AM.  Perhaps, this tea gives me the adverse effect.  It made me cannot sleep.  After about 9 hours drinking the tea, I was finally able to sleep.  Perhaps, eventually, the tea's substance effectiveness (keeping me awake) wore off.  And since 4:00 AM was pass my bed time, I finally able to sleep for two hours.  Somehow, my body reacted differently than most people.

I don’t think this is the real Night Night Tea. It tastes different and the box is purple instead of blue.

If I could give this product zero stars I would. I tried this for the first time last night, optimistic it was going to help me sleep better, it had the effect like I drank a pot of caffeinated coffee. I twitched the entire night and this morning almost 12 hours later I still have a horrible taste in my mouth from it and I feel hungover from such poor sleep.  It’s definitely not the product for me to help me sleep better.

Seriously.

did nothing for me :)  I am sorry to say.  I dont even see an 800 number to call to make customer comments.Will not buy this brand again,

Bought this for my teenage son who has special needs which make it difficult for him to sleep.  After we started giving him this tea at bedtime, his teacher told us he was sleepy and falling asleep in school.  After two Google searches, I discovered that this tea contains Valerian.  WebMD says Valerian may cause excitability and insomnia.  The box says it contains "passionflower" and a "proprietary blend" of herbs.  If you have a child with special needs, learn from my mistake.

Not even half a bag!

Granted, I have not tried it yet...however...VERY disappointed on how it arrived!  The box was totally smashed and tea bags were falling out, one even opened and tea leafs were everywhere.  Great presentation!! Really??Let's HOPE they taste better than they looked :(

Disgusting taste. Did not work.

Great tea before bedtime. However, this shipment was poorly packaged in an envelope. The tea box was completely crushed.

I love traditional medicine teas in general this one I just did not like- was just disappointed with flavor

Didn’t help.

This takes like warm pee with a mint aftertaste.

This doesn’t help me sleep at all. In fact, I was more awake after drinking it.

Damage  open box

Flavor changed like it has valarian in it.The last 2 weeks I've been having on and off allergic reaction type symptoms"Breathing issues, racing heart, histamine production..etc..etc"I've even fasted "but allowed tea" for a few days to eliminate possibilities, I was "sure" it couldn't be the tea.Well at first after fasting I was thinking it had to be a external influence but started to realize that I was also having some stomach issues with holding air, acid reflux, stomach cramps..etc .etc along with the others mentioned and it magically disappeared for a few days.Today I was researching some investment strategies, drank some coffee ate some breakfast..etc, feeling pretty good and around noon I make a teaAlmost instantly I could feel a burning like sensation as I drank it but was thinking cause it's hot and all that.Within 20 minute of drinking a half cup I start having breathing issues and the rest againI found that taking ALOT of tums, drinking water and almond milk kind helped in the past so I do the same and it starts to go away.Currently it's getting better as the time passes to get it out of my system.I'm almost positive this tea has changed somewhere down the line.I've taken passionflower and what nots plenty of times as a naturopath person and never had this reaction.It tastes pretty bad now also.So I don't know if they accidentally added valarian, or if received a contaminated crop?Just don't do what I do and drink it fast, and feel it out to see you're reaction.

I love the calming  effect ,since I started using it I've been able to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep. love the taste  😋 best quality tea.

I am currently recovering from an accident and when I came back home from acute rehabilitation I was struggling sleeping, I would would stay awake all night trying to get comfortable. Due to lack of sleep I got other health issues and a friend recommended this tea. I drink one every night before going to bed and it does relax me and I can get better sleep. Easy to use and it doesn’t taste bad. You can add honey but I drink it by itself.

Very nice flavor.  Does help me relax at day's end!

Ok tea

I was relaxed and had a good night sleep. It really helps with sleep.

Reasonable price

It is not as effective as other sleepytime teas.

I was having difficulty to sleep, but not anymore, thanks to this delicious tea that I decided to give it a try without expecting much. It surprises me how good it works, because I could say I'm sleeping a lot better now after I started to drink, I have to say that I use two bags of tea together to make it a little bit stronger. Flavor is good.

Tom has trouble sleeping, so caffeine is out after noon.  But we find ourselves craving a cuppa at bedtime. We’ve tried a variety of herbal teas, and Nighty Night is Tom’s favorite.  It’s not for me because I can’t tolerate any hint of mint in my tea.  But Tom loves it.

I really like this mask

This didn’t work for me and the flavor was just ok. I wouldn’t purchase again

I wanted to try this as I heard so many good things about this tea. I was excited when I got it. But unfortunately I did not like the taste.

Steeped it for about 10 minutes with no darkening of the water.  The flavor is the lightest I have ever tasted.Disappointed as I love this brand.  Their teas are normally very flavourful

It’s ok

The tea is fine. But came in the envelope,  so the box got smashed. Poor packaging.

Product as to be expected. Poor packaging- the box was extremely smashed and tea bags out of box.

Product is what it is but product came NOT sealed which was bothersome..

Good flavor

Excellent. Except for the taste, it's a little strong.

Won't knock you out..... But ..... It will relax 😌 you.

I usually don’t use anything to help me to fall asleep but lately I was having a very difficult time falling asleep, so I decided to give it a try, well so far it works. I am able to sleep in about 10 after started drinking it.

Tea is amazing. But the shipping of this product was way below satisfactory! They shipped this product in a padded envelope! Needless to say the tea box was totally destroyed! Tea it self was ok to use.

Didn't help me sleep like i expected

I did not appreciate that the box that I received was broken, but for sure the tea must be good,it have good ingredients

Takes a little getting used to, but it does seem to help my mind and body relax. It does upset my tummy a bit, though.

The tea relaxed me but really didn't help me sleep.

helps calm anxiety and enable you a good night sleep .

I had unpleasant dreams

Good

A great product.

sleepy tea is tasty, the color is too light, takes too long to get color

You won't feel drowsy, but you will sleep easy and have the best night's sleep waking totally refreshed.  I highly recommend. Ive purchased it for a few people. Can't say enough about it.

This bedtime tea is fantastic! I usually buy Yogi brand but tried this instead and I am not disappointed!

Love it

I use this tea to help relax me for sleep. Tastes good too. I recommend this herbal tea

It works for me!!

This is great to drink right before bed. It's relaxing.

I love my tea and drink it nightly before bed. Can’t go without it.

I have tried both Sleepytime Extra and Unisom. Neither has been working for me. It’s been very hard for me to sleep lately with work and relationship issues but I drank this tea last night and it is the most calm and restful I’ve felt in a really long time. Grateful for whoever came up with this.

I love the balance of the mellow flavorful herbs in this tea.

This tea really is a great relax and fall asleep tea ..it workes for me . My new relax drink !!

Great taste and fully soaks unlike others that don’t turn the water a tea color.

I found this product helped me to relax and fall asleep.  It has a nice flav9r and definitely lives u0 to its purpose

Tastes great and drift me off to sleep peacefully.

So soothing and relaxing. I love drinking this team to help me sleep instead of taking melatonin.

Love it!

Loved the tea. Really relaxed me.  Really  good.the best I’ve ever drank. Sleep So well!

This tea is exactly what I was hoping for. I enjoy the flavors of spearmint and lemon verbena and it was very relaxing. I recommend this’

Several family members and I all swear by this tea as an aid to sleep. I think it tastes great but I do use honey in my tea, can’t speak for how it tastes without honey…

Great sleep aid.  doens't knock you out but helps you drift off

Tea is soothing before bedtime relaxing and puts me to sleep

Excellent service, quality product. Thanks.

This was recommended to me by an acupuncturist. It works well and tastes fine, rather mild. Occasionally I add a sweetener and some lemon. But most importantly it helps me fall asleep and go back to sleep quickly when I wake up in the middle of the night. Plus it’s organic. This variation is Much Better tasting and smelling. Than Nighty Night Extra.

The product works for me. I can feel relaxed after drinking.

Not only delicious but works! Improved my sleep..reduced water retention..feel calmer..will definitely reorder!

I been having difficulty sleeping , and staying asleep. I been drinking this tea, and I been sleeping through out the whole night. It’s great value , and taste pretty good.

Very effective as a sleep aid. Slight grogginess the following day.

I enjoyed the tea. Was outta my sleep gummies and by golly, the tea did the trick🫡💜

Sipping this tea before bed, along with turning all electronics off and reading a few pages of a novel, has improved my sleep. I’ve been able to fall asleep faster and sleep longer.

I am going through a hard season and this PUTS ME TO BED. It’s a lovely hour before bedtime habit  - I’m on my second box :)

I have a hard time falling and staying asleep at night. Usually my mind wont slow down. For the past few weeks I have been drinking this tea in the evening about an hour before I goto bed and it works!  Highly recommend!!

I didn’t have any expectations for this tea- I just thought it was chamomile, tbh, I don’t really have sleep problems. I just fixed myself a cup for something to have one night. And BAM, I slept like somebody hit me on the head with a 2x4. My husband even made fun of me for sleeping so hard that I was all wonky in the bed, like I just fell into it. I have had it several nights now with the same result. I wake up very refreshed. The only odd thing I notice is that I have either more vivid or more memorable dreams, but not nightmares. I would definitely recommend it, and am ordering a box for my insomniac parents.

worked ok i drink afew cups before bed it is also cheaper on here than my local store.

Nice flavor

I wake up during night& stay up. I drink this,appears to help. Nice flavor,good price.

I loved it all.

I have a cup of this before bed and it really helps me to go to sleep!

Good

Whenever I have stress, I would drink a cup of this tea before I go to bed. I noticed a great difference on the sleep quality from this tea. I also recommended it to a friend who has trouble sleeping at night and he said it does help with his sleep. The only thing I don't like much is the smell of it but it's tolerable.

Box arrived smashed and sticky. Product unusable and now I’m finding out that the item is “not returnable”.

would not buy again

Very stinky tea that my bf told me not to drink and made my lady parts taste weird

Woke me up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. Trash.

Did not taste good as other have described. It tasted like dirty water and smelled like oregano. Worst tea I've ever tasted...

Depending on the brand and the amount of valerian in the mix, some of the nighttime teas taste pretty bad.  This strikes a good balance; it seems to have enough of everything so that it works well as a sleepy time tea, and it also tastes quite nice.  It’s now my go-to.

Helps me sleep

Delicious tea! The package arrived crushed, but the teabags were fine.

Love this blend

Smells awesome, the valerian root is pretty strong so it’ll relax the heck outta you. I was having a hard time sleeping for a while and my therapist recommended valerian root as an alternative to OTC drugs. Let’s just say, VALERIAN ROOT DONT PLAY NO GAMES. it’ll knock you out (in a most blissful slumber way)

It has no scent to it, the taste is mild and sweet almost like chamomile.I grab two packs per serving at night time and I sleep like a baby!Completely recommend

Did not work very well for me.

Makes me drowsy every time. And taste great. A win win 🏆

It’s yucky. And sticky.

This is a nice light tea, perfect for drinking before bedtime.  Unfortunately, it was shipped to me in a bubble envelope.  The envelope was intact, but the box was crushed.  I should be able to save most of the teabags, but I sure can’t give it as a gift!  Hopefully, I can find it locally ( or buy it from someone who will ship it in a box).

An ok tasting tea, just not helping me much. I will keep trying.

It’s a great product - fresh and flavorful soothing tea. But when it came, the box was completely bent and ripped and the teabags were scattered.

would have wanted it to be a bit stronger, even if before bed

I have fibromyalgia which brings sleep issues. If I forget to drink this tea I have trouble falling asleep. I have recommended this tea to others and they agree it has made a positive impact on improving sleep.

Seems to promote falling asleep and staying asleep. Like that it is all natural.

Absolutely love this tea. Not a huge fan of tea packets but these ones are for sure eco friendly and organic so win win! The flavor is delish

Pukka is one of my favorite brands. I'm never disappointed.

Flavor is pretty good.

Sweet bloom on tongue

This is my favorite flavor by this brand, though the package was crushed when I got it.

I love all Pukka teas

Great product!

Amazing taste, quality tea. It's cheaper at the grocery if they carry it where you are. If not, still worth ordering

Love the taste.

Best nighttime tea I've ever come across.

I was sceptic but my daughter bought me a box to try , I’m so thankful the blend is one of the best relaxing teas I ever had .I’d recommend this to anyone for sleep, relaxation and anxiety , it tastes great with hints of the licorice to give it a sweet snap no worries on tasting or smelling valerian kudos to puka .I have used all ingredients separately though the combination is the magic bullet .A loyal customer for ever .

I bought this to put in a gift basket for a friend who says that she struggles to sleep at night. Though I'm not sure how she likes it, she got excited and definitely seemed to appreciate it when she saw it . Now, since reading the ingredients before purchasing it, it's time for me to get some for myself. Will try to remember to update my review once I've given it a try.

Taste delicious, and smells great!

Had to get it for my friend; it's her favorite.

You can literally give me a horse tranquilizer and I can't sleep lol, this tea knocked me out! Made me so relaxed and sleepy so I stocked up! Love it

horrible taste, do not believe this was fresh three mint, no mint taste

It seems like the ONLY fresh and minty tasting tea I have purchase so far is the MINA organic Nana Moroccan tea. Every other has been great disappointment.

This order was not complete - I only received one box when the order was for three boxes of tea.

I only received one out of three Pukka three mint orders.

For having 3 mints disappointed. No flavor. No fragrance.

Didn't like it

I was hoping to buy some tea with Great rich flavor, like their page said.  This had none of this and was probably the most bland tea I have ever tried.  "Made with organic peppermint, spearmint and fieldmint."So what is Fieldmint anyway?  Never heard of it.This is a fake description and product in my opinion:* Good news for refreshing the palate* Made with organic peppermint, spearmint and fieldmint* Three types of mint for a vibrant cool and Supreme sweetnessI DO NOT RECOMMEND!

This tea tastes good.  It's too bad you'll only be able to drink tea from half of them.  As soon as you add water the bags open up and leaves go everywhere.  I will not be buying this brand again.

If you love this actual tea and the brand, go for it. I was expecting more of a peppermint - strong mint flavor being that it has 3 different mints... but its more of a herbey mint flavor. grass...pass. Not here I am stuck with all these teas...

There’s no flavor to this tea

I haven't had any tea as I may need to return this package that was not as advertised.

NOT a 6 pack!

The tea has a weak taste. Not happy with it. I won't buy again.

Good stuff, but it’s definitely one that can take a longer steeping time. The package arrived smashed in a torn plastic mailer bag, but the tea itself was undamaged.

Great tea ! I love it!

I always made old fashioned red rose tea with mint added.I now indulge in Iced Lemongrass,Green with perhaps 2 to 3 of these 3 mint teabags.A bit of citrus (Lemon or Lime)The Best for those hot summer days.

I love mint tea and drink about a cup or 2 daily. It's extremely good with honey and some crystallized ginger. Sometimes almond milk and a dash of cinnamon

It took about 2 cups of tea to get used to the taste but then I enjoyed it and appreciate the quality of the tea

My favorite tea. Helps settle my stomach and is delicious. I wish it was less expensive.  But my favorite mint tea.

Popular among your local supermarket all over the UK. Missed them so much after moving back to the US, and I can’t find them anywhere except for Amazon.

I bought this for my son, who loves green teas and mint teas.It was robust but not overwhelming, but the right amount of mintiness.He and both love to put a bag with a bag of gree in a large travel mug- great flavor, and a touch of caffeine.It's a wonderful product.

I had been buying 3 Mint aqt a local store. That store closed.  Other loca vendors have Puka, but not 3 Mint.  So I turned to Amazon.

My daughter loves mint tea. I’ve bought Tazo, Traditional Medicinals, Yogi, and a few other brands I can’t remember, but this one is her favorite.

Fresh n tasty.

I prefer Harney and Sons, however, this tea is not bad at all.

If you like mint tea - then this is definitely for you. I find the flavor of the three mints calming especially if I’m stressed or have nausea. It’s a great go-to to have in your cupboard for anyone who likes tea or for health purposes. I’ve been drinking it for a while, so as a repeat buyer of this flavor, and brand, I highly recommend trying it. It’s good hot or cold.

This tea is getting harder and harder to find in stores. So glad I found it here at a decent price!

Such an intense mint tastes.  Love it, my favorite tea ever!!!

Trusted brand, great value. Very good

the best herbal tea for calming my digestive issues

Love that mint tea.  Great taste and great value for your money

Great flavour

I try various teas and often get tired of them, but this one has stood the test of time. One of my favorites.

I have sent this tea to loved ones and it has become a favorite. I love the quantity and value for the price.

Tasty and calming before as it has no caffeine. Also works well to settle your stomach.

I tried many mint teas and this one is by far my favorite. I highly recommend drinking it with a splash of oatmilk!

Delicious mint herb tea. I was worried about it being too weak or taking too long to brew from some reviews, but nope, brews fully in less than 2 minute. Also it tastes very fresh and naturally minty - no hint of any chemical, stale, or other off flavor which I pick up in so many purported herbal teas.

Was dubious about effectiveness for nausea...but it works !!!  Flavor is far superior to other brands of Peppermint teas.

My flavor

I recently read mint can help reduce inflammation, joint pain, and acne.  It is working for me and the taste of this tea is minty and rich.  It’s the best mint decaffeinated tea I’ve tried.  I’m also a fan of the tazo zen mint green tea, if I want something caffeinated.  This tea is slightly more expensive, but very reasonable considering it’s fairtrade and the packaging is environmentally friendly.  Will continue to purchase.

We drink this tea at night when it’s cold out. We absolutely love it. I’m a huge fan of the tea bags as well, please keep in mind that not all companies use - non plastic tea bags. Plastic tea bags are Not good for your health. Stay safe everyone

Nothing more to add, for me it's the best blend of different mint teas that I could find in the US.

Refreshing iced and soothing hot.

Love it, the mint is well balanced and the flavor isn't intense. Works great for stress and upset stomach. Was also carefully packaged so none of the boxes were damaged.

This is such a nice tea and while we love it because of the flavor, my friend is Persian and says it is good for stomach upset with nabat.

It's very smooth and has a Great taste. My favorite mint tea. It's hard to find in the store.

I love this mild, gentle mint tea. It soothes my stomach and refreshes when I drink in addition to just being delicious!

Personally I’m a huge tea fan. Like that this one is non-caffeinated and offers 3 different flavors within one bag. You can definitely taste all the flavors. Perfect choice for a warm and healthy nightcap.

I love all tea,  this was super delicious. Very nice flavor, smooth.  I am a honey lover, but don't need it with this item.

Mix it with chocolate rooibos and it will take like peppermint barks.

Best mint taste I ever had

Love the taste. Very refreshing.

Great flavor blend. I will be purchasing this again. I would very much recommend this product.

Great for stress, relaxation, and soothes the mind, stomach, and the soul. This tea brings peace.

Nice tasting mint tea. Not overly minty. More gentle taste and smell.Great brand of teas...

I haven't had a Pukka that I didn't like, but this one is extra delicious!!

I drink this every night before bed. It settles my stomach and lets me unwind. If I don't drink it, I am a wreck the next day

Tasty tea with a well balanced blend of mints. Soothing for a sore throat

The blend of flavors is really tasty.

Nice packaging, good flavor but I expected more

This tea has a lovely scent and wonderful flavor!

I love this tea

Best pukka peppermint tea! Great price in bulk!

The best tasting and highest quality of all of the mint teas that I have tried.

Love this tea. Again , and again new customer.

Really nice mint tea!!

I thought this tea sounded delicious. It ended up being so bitter...so disappointing

Is this deceptive advertising?  I received one stinking box when there are supposed to be a pack of SIX  boxes.  I am complaining and returning.

This is my favorite night time tea - a cup is relaxing and calming at the end of the day. The flavor is great, with a touch of sweetness so no additional sweetener is needed, and I just add a splash of milk to make it perfect. I have gifted this tea to others because I like it so much. It feels like a little bit of a splurge, but is totally worth it to me.

Good tea, nice flavor

I hate tea, but when I have a sore throat or bad cough, this soothes it better than anything else I’ve tried.  Sometimes I add a splash of vanilla cream to it and it tastes like dessert, which is great when you have strep or the flu and all you can eat is toast or broth.

Pukka offers some of the best herbal tea blends I've ever had. I first found them in the UK and I was happy to find they sell here too! They have a large selection of black, green and herbal teas.Chamomile and Vanilla flavors complement each other very well and the subtle taste of Manuka honey makes this a great non caffeinated blend. They were packaged carefully and were delivered without any problems.

My favorite tea to help with sleep. Having difficulty finding it elsewhere, this is quite overpriced.

At first I didn't like this tea much.  I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.

Great tea - love the flavor!  While the packaging is pretty, I wish they would put it in a smaller container. Save the planet on cardboard as the box is not full. And lower the price. But all that said, I keep buying it because it is so good.

Like the flavor it’s a good tea!

Love this tea but for some reason not as good as from the store...when I received my package it smelled heavily of taco seasoning. Don't get me wrong, I'm no lunatic, I love tacos, I even buy my taco seasoning via subscribe & save from Amazon, but this is a review for chamomile tea, a far cry from tacos, I think. Anyway, I curiously opened the envelope and took a deep whiff of the 6 boxes of tea I'd just purchased -- yep, tacos. "Taco tea?" I asked myself? I dunno...maybe it was just shipped with some strong stuff....I decided to chance it 'cause I really like this tea. Well, you'll never believe it, it's actually quite a bit bland compared to what I'd been used to from the store. Takes two bags to get it where I like and still cheaper, but at least it doesn't taste like tacos.

Great product but- it arrived in a large soft sided envelope and was crushed so bad the box couldn't be used, had to put them in a zip lock. l

Pricey but exactly what I wanted. I received a sample in the mail and loved it but getting more has proved challenging. I found it on Amazon but it's a bit expensive. The flavor is fantastic for someone like me that is picky about tea. It's very relaxing before bed.

Delicious, and soothing!

With having use of a coupon it was a great buy. Make sure you follow the directions on the package because it makes a difference in the flavor

chamomile + vanilla + manuka honey = perfection, especially since it's all organic. thank you to pukka for creating this tea!

This is a very warm cozy tasting treat before bed. My ritual in the evenings always includes this tea.

This is my favorite chamomile tea. It has a lovely soothing flavor, smoother than more flowery tasting chamomile teas.

I discovered Pukka Herbal teas and I Love them. This is one of my favorites

My favorite night time tea. Delicious and calming

Great tea

One of my favorite, chamomiles, along with Taylors and Wissotzsky.

This is the best chamomile tea! The vanilla and honey flavors come through. I love giving this one as an add on for gifts for Mother's Day, teachers, etc. Everyone loves this tea and wants to know where I get it. I've only found it at amazon and central market. I might start buying in bulk to stock my gift closet...

Lovely flavour

Not wanting to believe the poor reviews, I thought I knew better.  (I normally buy the loose leaf version from another company but was stuck, so went with Pukka.). What an absolute waste of $$.  I use at minimum 3 tea bags for a .5l and the taste is OK.  Will NEVER buy from this company again!  Stale and disappointing.

Great flavor,  but waaaaaay overpriced.  Almost twice the regular price. Go find it somewhere else.

These tea bags had no flavor.  Ugh

I bought the sample, it was great. I then bought a lot of 6 packs for 2 flavors. It came the next day. It was fake! It did not smell, taste, or brew to anything. Expiration said 2024, so must have been fake. Too late to return! Be careful!

I had been purchasing the Peppermint and Licorice tea from Tea Pigs for a long time, but it got extremely pricy. I decided to try this as an alternative and I find that I like it just as well, if not a little more, at a 1/3 of the cost. It is my FAVORITE tea flavor. The notes of both peppermint and licorice are noticeable, but not overpowering. I like it because it's a tad sweet and satisfies my sweet tooth rather than eating something I shouldn't. People think it sounds like a nasty combination, but it's fantastic! Try it. You may be pleasantly surprised.

Wife uses this all day long , she is extremely satisfied with this product- highly recommend

I purchased this herbal tea purely by accident at out local grocery store, but ended up loving it so much that it became one of my regulars.  The flavor combination is wonderfully refreshing, hot or cold ad one tea bag is enough for an entire pot.  Tip: once your water is boiling, let it settle for a few minutes before pouring it. Let it steep an extra two to three minutes.

Love this tea. Warming and smooth. Current prices are crazy outrageous.

I use 2 teabags at a time + a small amount of sugar= EXCELLENT 👍😊

The boxes were opened a bit and actually theproduct ordered was in a box with adifferent ingrediant selection. But the productordered was inside the box and is whatwas ordered. Apparently an error in boxingthe product.

Very good tasting tea; recommended.  I drink it at night before bed.  It’s not as good as Aveda comforting tea but as close as you will get at a much lower price.  Very similar to Aveda tea but a little sweeter tasting.

This is my favorite tea and I buy it in multiples. I ordered three boxes from the he same seller and for whatever reason, they arrived in three separate packages and on different days! (Why?!?) Surely my strangest Amazon experience. Nevertheless, great tea! As a singer, I find it very soothing.

I know the flavor sounds weird, but if you like tea, like licorice flavor, and like peppermint…you will love this tea. I keep it stocked my my tea cabinet at all times. It’s wonderful.

This tea tastes just like less expensive peppermint teas that I already have.  Disappointed that there isn't a stronger licorice flavor.

I usually buy Stash Licorice Mint and love it, but it has been out of stock.  Then I tried the Yogi brand, which my husband loves, but I find it way too spicey and strong smelling, but at least its flavorful.  I tried this Pukka brand and it has very little flavor, subtle mint and I dont even taste the licorice.

It's drinkable, but there's almost no licorice flavor, only mint. It's too bad, because I've liked other Pukka teas, but this one is dull.

Nice tea quite refreshing but you cant taste the licorice in it, nether of the flavours are strong, a little disappointed i love licorice flavour and it would have been a great tea if the two flavours were strong.

Great flavor for a cup. For 16 oz use two bags. Very good with a little honey. Buying the 3 pack is the best value.

This is a good after dinner tea as it settles the stomach.  It is too sweet though.

Takes a little while to steep to get good flavor. Nevertheless, the value is so much better than the Aveda tea.

Didn't have the Peppermint taste that I like.

Pukka's Peppermint and Licorice Tea has a nice balance of the two flavors. Neither one overpowers the other, and even this licorice hater found the fennel flavor to be refreshing and unexpectedly delicious. It was very soothing to my cold-ravaged throat this weekend. Recommended for folks who like peppermint tea but also appreciate a little adventure in your mug.

Interesting mix of flavors. Don't steep too long otherwise it is too bitter.

I have limited experience with teas, especially this flavor of licorice and peppermint. The whole family likes it and we save some money using subscribe and save.

Discovered this in Iceland and searched Amazon to continue my love affair with it. Feels like I’m drinking dessert. Licorice flavor isn’t overpowering at all.

This has become an addiction to my daily routine; it works as described in the product description.

This is a fabulous tea! Teapigs' is better, but if you're looking for a fairly-traded, good quality peppermint and licorice tea, this is the tea you want! Note to tea buyers: although this tea is great: be warned. Not every blend of tea is exactly the same. Some will have more flavor, others will have less. Unless something is seriously wrong, you're likely to get a perfectly good blend every time, as long as you have that expectation!

Not too sweet, just right! Pukka is my fav brand of teas. Peppermint Licorice is my all time fav flavor!!

Love this tea! I brew a big cup with two bags to enjoy in the evenings before bed.

This tea is very good. I do like stronger tastes so for me it could be stronger but I still like it very much. So much that I just reordered it, in a larder sise.

I use it when my stomach is upset it is soothing!

Great aroma and taste.

I always drank Aveda tea at the salon and trying to get it at home was too pricey for me. Looking for alternatives I found this. It’s sweet and hits the spot for me before bed.

This tea is very flavorful and soothing to drink. I will buy it again

Hard to find this locally but Amazon has it at a great price. If you like Mighty Leaf Marrakesh Mint, you may like this one too. I can't pick a favorite.

great in the evening when you want a good tea without honey or another sugar. Some may not l I keep it because it has a strong distinct taste.

Tried this tea because of the Agatha Frost 'Cosy Murder Mystery' series and now I'm addicted! Really love this tea!

I usually drink regular black tea but this tea has a great flavor and appeal in the afternoon.  Yummy!

Has just a touch of sweetness. DELICIOUS! Have been making a cup of this every night for years.

Love this tea! I drink it every night as I am reading in bed. Lovely taste and aroma.

This tea isn't too sweet but still doesn't need to be sweetened. The flavor is very bold and leaves a nice aftertaste in my mouth. It's a nice bevrage for when I'm craving something a little sweet.

This tea is a household favorite. I bought 6 boxes a few months ago. And just purchased 6 more boxes. The tea has a lovely minty aroma and first taste. There is a lingering natural sweetness from the licorice.

I love the taste of this tea but my only complaint is it hurts my teeth. I have no idea why it hurts my teeth but it does. Bummer. Going to give it to my mother in law but I love the taste and it combines my two favorite flavors.

Great all by itself. Usually use sweetener and 1/2and1/2, but this stands alone. Makes it a great tea to carry around and use when there is nothing but hot water available.

So refreshing and helps w digestion

We're big fans of the Puka teas; this one is our favorite. Great flavor -- you can reuse the teabag for a second cup that still retains the taste.

This tea was far superior to the last one I had ordered (Stash) for I perfer a dark tea

Bought for my Wife who loved it!

best tea! sweet but natural! organic

love this tea! tastes exactly the same as Aveda Te but costs waaaaay less. so good! love the different flavors together.

Hands down my favorite tea

Yes, everything I expected. Wonderful for easing my GERD symptoms.

Love this tea!

Sampled this as part of the Pukka Days of Christmas and hands down by far the best caffeine-free tea I've had with no added sweetener needed! I was mildly surprised at how naturally sweet it was. I can probably drink this on a daily that I'm willing to invest in 120 tea bags at one time lol.

I love this tea and it was delivered quickly !

Sweet and delicious without adding sugar

I love it when I love something I've never tried before.  Kind of reminds me to give myself the same advice I give my kids…"try it, you'll probably like it"!  I absolutely love this tea, something about it that tastes familiar in a comfort food kind of way.  I do like licorice and I love peppermint but whose idea was it to put them together?  Has this always been a thing and I've been missing out?  Excellent flavor, looking forward to my cup after the kids go to bed tonight….

I'm a fan of peppermint tea. I wasn't sure I was going to like this tea at first, because all I smelled was licorice upon opening the box, but once I brewed it and tasted it, it was so good! Pepperminty and sweet without even having to add any sugar.Also the box is super cute.

Delicious!!! I received a sample of this box. It is a really lovely tea. I had a hard time thinking these flavors could pair but they do. I'd say the main flavor is mint with a hint/kick of licorice. It's not overpowering at all. If you love black licorice you'll love this tea!

Love this tea! Very smooth, not super licorice-y. I have a cup almost every night and have re-purchased several times. Highly recommend.

Very fine and pure taste--the way mint and licorice is supposed to taste.  Without that contrived, synthetic flavor that so many manufacturers tend to market.

I am drinking this every night and enjoying every sip.

Refreshing, great cold and wonderful hot to close out the day.

I enjoy it. It has a nice taste

Oh my God yummy goodness! Good brand and good flavors and good quantity for the price. YES!

Warning!! I observed Latex Production in my teens,it should be like a car tire rubber with less  Durometer of hardness because Tires are made to endure roads/streets,etc.,not sleep on.Latex should be resilient,firm,rubber like,yet tender,(Not pasta to the tooth al dente)giving to a point,(Yet nothing of the sinking of memory foam I dislike),firm more than expensive leather couch padding,(Ok for a brief period,yet not too decent for sleeping on a lot.) Latex is the opposite of the cheap,airy,not even Polyurethane or latex foam they sent,I am insulted for myself and the unwary,as the reviews I read should have warned me,they almost did,especially the complaints of how it's like a no support foam,which is exactly what it is.I worked making furniture a year or 2 in my teens and at 20,this "latex" is super cheap foam,a joke,considered as only one or two of the many layers (They would be firmer for the middle inner of a mattress,than this rip off foam,though.)in making beds,needed near the top layer under the covering and stitching,I would choose a dry very stiff thin foam layer,direct under the outer cover,then this foam,it cannot really be noticed,it flattens immediately like nothing there,though helps protect the covering,it must be protected from underneath,a matress made like this can last for many years without flattening too much,I learned this from one of the best Mattress Makers,thats how she learned,after High School.This "latex" is about what I just mentioned,the most cheapest, unsupporting foam ever,not even worth maybe $2.00,about what I paid for it then while making matresses,at 1" thick,twin size.(I thought it reminded me of something,even my first job stocking in a corner store for "Umpteen" $ a week,whats that mean,I asked.$13.00,I was told,the first teen after $12.00,your'e only 10 years old,just a child.(Ha-ha,I'm amused nowadays,I did not think it was funny then.Hard to forget.Not exactly big $,boy,did I work hard all my life.)Latex is the best I have had,(Except for air matresses,if they wouldn't flatten,a bunch cheap and expensive went in the trash,not really worth the $.)first Dunlop,which can smell,the plastic helps,then Talalay,which smells less,(Talalay is better,as the refining process is better and more cost to make than Dunlop,do not let anybody lie to you.)the reverse of any latex is bad,if the under matress is not of enough firmness,the latex on top is not supported enough.Expect splits in about a year anyway on either choice,D or T,placed on a hard board,or however,glues do not work too decent,tapes are better.Personally,I wrap my matresses,pillows and toppers in 6ml plastic,use enough to place mattress flat,bring over and beyond top,about a foot beyond,cut to match,or one an inch or so short,black Gorilla tape Tough and Wide(Better than other colors,worth the $15.00 or so.),tape so seam is in middle or so,fold and press,bring up on mattress,press and try to eliminate space,tape again,seam to matress,I use many small peices to shorten up any billowing,a small hole,(You usually do not need to,when you try it out,it'll pop,you may need a small peice of tape if too big,leave a tiny opening.)Do this first before wrapping a comforter around mattress and topper,(Topper is,of course,already on mattress top.),and hold comforter with under straps,though straps can and do break.The comforter stops much of the hot/cold/stick/noise problem,as it is thick enough to,hell,the comforter themselves doubled,2 can provide 4 plush layers,making your own topper,adjustable,the bargain ones at Departyment Stores are worth it here,way better than useless foam.(The "useless" foam is needed in bed making though,as the 2nd layer under the stiff styrofoam like layer just under the stitched covering must have this foam next,or the matress swiftly chaps,the next 10 or so layers are of varying foams,etc.,adjusted to the vare of firmness,etc.)A fitted sheet can work to hold comforter smoothly.Attach the straps to that,as the thickness of comforters tends to break the holders on straps.The comforter can be used a long time before washing,the 6ml plastic virtually water/dust proofs it,a spills a pain,at least the plastic can be damp wiped.I do not eat or drink on my matresses anymore,rare.I keep one comforter ready/stored for that reason,air tighted is best,or chew throughs can occur,they do not know what food is anyway.The pillow(s) need a zip case or 2,works better than 2 pillow cases,with 2nd one reversed,sticking to plastic is to be avoided.This "Latex"rip off (I thought the name was funny.) is not even latex foam they sent for 137.79 twin size,with 4 year warranty,they claim it is natural latex,(No way!Real Latex is like actual flexible rubber.),and upon unwrapping,I felt and knew immediately what it is,a rip off.A lot of people do not know latex,having never seen it made,it is liquid rubber from a rubber tree,processed shaped,mixed sometimes,like Talalay, and cured in a form,so if that expensive latex topper or mattress cost x amount of $ to make,make sure to get the warranty,worth every penny,as they still make a profit from the cost of the warranty alone,it covers the obtaining and production,all "Overhead."Though everything must break, eventually,it cost minimal,or not at all,if so many acres of rubber trees are owned,#100,00 plus matresses can be made first,before machines break,what's 10 or $20,000 to fix a roller,(How expensive,compared to making many millions for a rip off.)thats what ruins existence,owners can have millions of $$ and more in their accounts,the next person's on welfare or ssi,or slave to a clock,not exactly because they want to be.(Yeh,charge thousands for something that costs $67.00 to make,overhead and all,not available to the Public.)Manufacturers,which are usually the Farm owners or source from etc.,think we are chattle.Well,though I consider I am my own person,they got enough $ to keep me poor,flattening my meager wallet condescendingly,they have too much $$, and do not share the land and resources properly,this Earth's a shame.Well,anywho,personally,I consider the Martha Stewart firm foam core pillow slight better than even shredded latex for a pillow,which is better than the whole latex pillow for me,though know I slept on a hard floor till I was 17.How cold,with just a bed sheet under me,it made me hard,though I grew up poor.Now I am 60,and not so hard anymore.It's always one thing or the other,if the water heater does not break,($14,000 plus,they wanted,I fixed it myself for less than $400.00,which includes $350. or so for a 40 gallon Electric hot water heater,just right for one person.),I gotta go up on the roof,though I got bunches more down time now,with time running out,now I gotta rewrap/return after waiting for delivery.I do not appreciate the excruciation and wall of ignorance on almost every product.Thank you.Mike

I am beyond disappointed w this manufacturer and VERY angry w myself… I purchased a Twin 3 inch topper on June 1st, 2024. It arrived and it IS and still IS AMAZING! So comfortable! ZERO smell, a wonderful topper! I bought the TWIN size topper as a topper for my sectional sofa (I have an amazingly comfortable mattress) because I have Lyme disease and my bones, muscles and joints hurt when I lay down and put any kind of pressure on them. I found such amazing relief w this product that I ordered another one on June 21st, 2024 for the other side of my sectional so I could sit and lay on either side free of pain. Well, I was traveling and delayed opening the box to get the second topper set up until last night Aug 14,2024. Way past my return window. Thus, being angry at myself… This new topper literally STINKS like a SKUNK! It has the most DISGUSTING odor! I mean RANK! I am beyond shocked that two identical toppers can arrive in identical packaging from the same company YET be of extreme difference in quality! I paid such a high price because it is a natural organic latex! There is NOTHING NATURAL about my second topper and it had to be carried out of the house into the garage until trash day! Highly disappointed!

I have a very firm IComfort memory foam mattress. It is not comfortable at all to me. I've purchased 2 different memory foam toppers and I sink into both of them and get "stuck" in the middle of the night.  THen I purchased 2 egg crate toppers and they were a joke. I researched so long and hard trying to decide what to do and what to buy. I need softness, alot of give, in order to be comfortable while still being supportive. I'm a side sleeper. I really believed this was the answer. I bought the 2" queen "soft". I almost bought the "medium" thinking the soft was going to be too soft and not enough support, but being a side sleeper I thought I needed the softness so I took a gamble and spent the money on this topper. (It's alot for a topper in my opinion so I didn't make this purchase without alot of consideration).  I was so excited to receive it, unpack it and heave it on the bed. Not an easy task for a 55 year old woman with bad arthritis and alot of pain in shoulders, elbows and wrists from tendonitis. I laid on it............it felt really firm to me, no soft feeling at all. I even wondered if maybe I was sent the firm by mistake, but I thought probably not, they don't make mistakes like that. The disappointment was extreme as this was barely even a little softer than my regular memory foam mattress. The only good thing is the bed is 2" higher, but I didn't need to spend almost $200.00 for that. I'm so disappointed and dont know what to try now. I feel like i'm never going to be comfortable again because I don't even want to keep trying products only to be disappointed then go thru the hassle of returning them, it's not even worth it anymore. I suffer from menopausal hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain and insomnia now........so atleast being comfortable at night while im dealing with all of this was EXTREMELY important to me.......i'm just crushed.

Still in the bag and being returned.  I have had 3 latex mattresses in my life so far and this is FAR from it.  There is NO weight, no bounce, no tension at all; it's just a thin flimsy spongy foam type topper that is riddled with some kind of bug holes (Each pic is a different part of the topper.  I do not feel the rubber AT ALL.  It goes flat as a pancake the minute you lay on it so what is the point??

I hardly ever write review, but felt this is something that needs saying.  I have successfully purchased and slept on latex mattress in the past and sold them with my prior house, so decided to get another one for my new place. After getting this mattress, I tried sleeping on it, but it had too many toxic off-gasses.  So, I spent a couple of weeks having it outside to off-gas, and also every day would spend three minutes to fold it up into a 12 inch pad for the chair, and sat on it up and down, up and down, over and over, making it breath in the fresh air and breath out the toxic air.  (The neighbors did stare sometimes as I know I must have looked funny).  But it still had a heavy odor.Plan B:  I took put it in the bath tub with 1/3 a bottle of liquid dish soap and did the "crush-the-grapes" walk on it for over an hour.  It took that long to get most of the soap out of it.  Then put it outside to dry for two days.I put it back on the bed and Viola! I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible smell... every time I would roll over, it would squeeze the bad gasses out of the topper and I could not get back to sleep... I tried for an hour... then finally took it off and in the morning got rid of it.Now I am a guy... meaning we are not very sensitive...  so I do not say this lightly, that I really could not sleep with the odor.  Now there are many good reviews, so I do not know if they changed the chemicals they used to create the topper, or if the topper is now a composite of latex and memory foam (which I have tried before, and it had way too much odor to keep)... anyways it is unbearable for me.  I am giving it a single star because it was unusable for me.

This is my second purchase from this seller. I returned the first item, but it was a few years ago, so when I ordered a topper recently, I did not realize I had ordered from them before. The first time the 2" latex topper was way too soft.  This time I ordered a 1" soft topper for my otherwise way too firm bed. For some reason Amazon won't let me update the purchase I made this time to reflect the actual item I am reviewing.  I had read reviews about the smell, but figured the reviewers were just unfamiliar with the sometimes initially strong smell of natural latex.I was wrong. Something is not right with this topper. When I opened the plastic, the smell was not THAT strong, though it was noticeable. When I went to bed that night, it was very noticeable, and did not smell anything like any of the natural latex mattresses or toppers I've owned.  All of those had a sweet, rubbery smell. This smells like cigarettes. That is not a natural latex smell.  I thought maybe it would go away after a bit. However, I went out of town for 4 days after spending only one night on this topper. When I got home, the topper had been on my bed for 5 days total and all my linens, including my comforter and my pillows, had the gross cigarette-like smell.I don't know what they are putting in this latex, but it's not right, and I can't imagine it's natural. Either that or they have a factory that allows smoking. NO joke. I am returning and will be buying a new topper elsewhere.Also, the topper arrived compressed, as they all do, but when this one was opened, there were deep groove/impressions in it. The impressions did not go away after decompression. They can actually be seen through my sheets.  That's odd. I don't know if they had this thing packed up for years in a smoky warehouse or what, but I've not had any new latex slabs arrive with permanent dips/grooves in them. I would not purchase from this company again. Too many sketchy issues.

Update 5 months later: The feel is great 5 stars but the stench of it is just too much.  I got this back in feb or march and the smell lessened over time but here it is almost October and the thing still stinks. Originally I thought it lessened because I covered it with a plastic protector and a mattress pad but I recently replaced the old mattress and those don’t fit it so I just have the sheet between me and it. It permeates the sheets and me. UGH!Original review: This definitely had a strong smell for at least 3-4 months. The smell recently stopped thankfully. Otherwise it’s good. My mattress is old and was soft when I bought it (not firm). I hated that I would sink like 4 inches in it. When I got this it felt wonderful to lay on but I’d wake up with horrible back pain. That was because my mattress was still too soft for me. The topper helps with sinking but it doesn’t fix all of it because the mattress under it still sinks. Another reviewer recommended flipping pillow top mattresses over if it was to soft. I did that got rid of my pain. There was still some sinkage from the mattress so I had to shove a blanket under the mattress that fixed all my issues. Now about the smell, that was seriously unpleasant. When I unpacked the topper I left the room and went into a room across the hall to work. A while later I noticed my nose was stuffed up. I didn’t think of the topper. Later I went into the hall to go to the bedroom and noticed it smelled and the hair seemed heavy. When I got in the bedroom it was hard to breathe. I opened the window and left it open. That night I put a plastic mattress cover and a thick mattress protector and sheets over it and I could still smell it. The smell was strong for about 3 weeks and I could smell it when I would roll over and on my skin for about 3-4 months.

Smell is so bad - I wish I read the comments first.This smell is so bad I could barely walk into the same room, sleeping on it cannot be good for you.Tried everything over a week to help with smell but it never diminished for a second.. need to dispose, wash everything, and try to forget this ever happened.

Bought a topper here on Amazon from the seller a couple of years ago, it was good.Found the seller‘s own store online， it carries mattress, so bought a pure organic latex mattress . didn’t Open and use it  until a couple of months, now stuck with a mattress that has very strong chemical smell.

Many people love this topper and are fine with it. But may not worth the risk of a full blown latex allergic  reaction. I apparently developed  a latex allergy later in life, and was not aware of it. A few nights on this topper ( with sheets/ protector on top) and I developed red  hives all over my arms and legs. Also pink eyes, sinus headache,cold symptoms, etc. (Symptoms lasted 2 + weeks.) I had to take steroids to clear it. Please find out if latex bothers you, or other members of your family, before you bring this massive amount of latex  into your house.

I thought the off gassing would dissipate over time, but 9 years later, my eyes would hurt when entering the guest room where the topper was moved.

First I tried the 1” topper and that did absolutely nothing. I decided to try the 3” and it feels comfortable at first but after about a month of sleeping on it I am waking up with pain all over my body every day. It’s like all my muscles are sore when I wake up from sleeping on this thing. Went to return it this morning and I am a few days past the return window so now I am stuck with a very expensive piece of foam I can’t use and can’t return

They hide the fact that this is Dunlop latex so far down in the listing that it's almost impossible to find that fact. I did find it because I've been waking up in pain ever since I put this on my bed because Dunlop is much firmer than Talalay. Had I known I would not have purchased this!

I designed to try the sleep on latex mattress topper, I found the firmness that is not what I like, so I decided to return it but the provided box cannot be put in the retun box. I have to find a box for myself and return it.

I (who weigh 130 pounds) put this on top of a brand new mattress and the topper compressed in the spot I usually sleep within 2.5 months. The mattress is fine it’s just this low quality topper.

Purchased the same topper 3 years ago.  The erosion of quality is enormous.  The new topper feels like it will fall apart.  In fact, whereas the old topper still does not flake, the new topper flaked coming out of the box and just by pinching the material portions will come off.  Very unfortunate as the previous topper is still amazing.  Save your money and spend it elsewhere.  It is too expensive to receive bad quality.

Item came to big for my bed hanging at least an inch on each side maybe it fits there full size mattress which I would have purchased had it not been so expensive. But for upgrading my old Mattress just doesn't work. Even worse then that my product came with edges all ripped up and black marks all over the middle of it. As a disabled individual it's difficult for me to get it out of the box and on my bed now I cant fit it in the original box to return it so I have to get a new box and someones help to return it.

3rd order from this company.  Product is fine.  Delivery by Fed Ex not so much.  Never place on either covered porch.  Left in front of garage door with no protection and can be run over by cars.  All other companies do it correctly.  Seller needs to fix.

After purchasing a new mattress that was very firm I wanted some additional plushness to add support for my hips and lower back. I purchased the 3-inch soft in a twin xl size as my husband did not want any change to his side. It was thicker than 3 in and while it did seem to help my back a little it was just too thick and I felt like I sunk too far into it. I also did not like the three inch height difference on the mattress between my side and his. So I returned it and ordered a 2 inch king size soft instead. The first two nights I felt like I slept better after that my back pain returned and upon pulling the sheets off and inspecting it I discovered it already had dips in it where he and I slept. It cost way too much money to already have dips after a few days. The area with the dips did not have the support that the rest of it did when I pressed down with my hand. I was very disappointed as I had hoped that latex would hold up years unlike memory foam. I returned the king as well.I also noticed a very strong latex smell with both of these I have asthma and tend to be more sensitive to smells than most. The smell did not bother my husband but it gave me a sick headache.

I'm not sure why this product exists really. The holes in the pictures don't go all the way through, which initially is why I bought it hoping it would breath better than a foam mattress topper. It falls apart from touching it or trying to position it in any way. As for using as a mattress topper, it's not supportive enough to make any real difference. The worst part is the smell. Others have mentioned that you can air it out for a few days, but the smell never got any better. My whole bedroom stinks of this material, and I prematurely threw away the box so I can't return it (not that I would have been able to compress it back in there anyhow). At this price I expected more, and I would caution anyone who might be looking at this product.

Updated the review from three stars to one. I've had it for over a year and the noxious fumes are every bit as strong as when I bought it. And minimizing the degree of offgassing is nothing short of deceiving.tl;dr: this was a waste of $300.I've had this mattress pad for over six months now. I used it for five days and it was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the latex smell is so intense that it was making me sick. I've kept it in a shed since then and I put it in the sun for days, but it's every bit as intense now as it was at the beginning. I know from experience that many things that I buy may cause problems for me, so it's something that I have to live with. One way that I get around it is that I read about products in advance. When it comes to latex mattress products, all of the manufacturers that I've seen will go to great pains to state how the smell of their products is minimal and “sweet” smelling (FYI: the fact that the smell is sweet does not lessen any ill effects that it may have). The reason why they do this is because they're trying to rightfully distinguish their natural products from the synthetically-polluted products of their competitors. In the process though, they misrepresent the truth: these mattress products produce a gas that is VERY intense. Many people won't be bothered by it, but other people are.

Bought Soft, weight: 155lbsI bought latex top and thought it won't sink, well after 8 months it started sinking in the middle causing lower back pain. Removed the topper and slept without it and back pain gone.Safe to say wasted money on this.

I purchased this to see if it would help me to sleep cooler and ease pressure points on a new mattress that was just feeling too hard.Based on the reviews I expected this to accomplish both.To be fair it did help with the softness factor- it has a strange "bowl full of jelly" feel to it that was not bad-just a bit strange. I could have easily  lived with that.What I could not bear was the heat! This made me much hotter than the memory foam topper I purchased to replace it. It actually appeared to store my body heat and reflected it all right back even through a cooling mattress cover and bamboo sheets. It does not sleep cool...not at all.Perhaps the worst thing though was the stench. I aired it out for 48 hours before putting it on the bed under the cooling mattress cover and the fitted bamboo sheet. Even though the worst of the smell off gassed while we aired it out-two weeks later I still got a whiff of the stench every time I pulled the sheets back each night and caught a bit more of it each time I tossed or turned to escape the heat build up.The smell was strong enough that it even bothered my husband.I had to return it.

The pictures taken immediately after taking out of the box. The pad has been cut off-center and has several air bubbles throughout creating weekend areas. I would send it back if I thought I could wrestle it back into the box but doubt I can do that. Nit worth the $165+ I paid for it.

The order arrived in September. My first low-rated review was deleted, for whatever reasons. There I mentioned a powerful fishy stink coming out as soon as the topper was removed from a plastic wrapping (not smell, I am quite familiar with the latex smell). The topper was left on a guest bed in a spare bedroom for 7 weeks. It was well well-ventilated room, with no cover on top of the topper. When I flipped it over, I discovered a few large mold spots under the topper, right on a mattress cover. Would recommend never trusting the description that a strong smell comes from Latex and it needs just to air-out.  Most likely, contamination during the production or damp storage.

My husband and I were waking up with backaches and thought we would try a mattress topper before investing in a new mattress set.  I've owned multiple mattress toppers over the years from down filled to fiber filled and this was by far the worst investment of $149 I've ever made.  First, the topper was too large for our queen mattress so the sheets wouldn't stay on the bed plus it is cut square so there is all this extra latex at the corners that doesn't fit into the bottom sheet.  More important however is that this topper is so soft it made our back problems ten time worse, to the point we couldn't stand or walk when we first got out of bed.  If you are looking for a super soft bed topper that you sink into and that provides zero support, this is the product you want.  If however, you are looking for any form of back relief or support in a bed topper look elsewhere because this one provides none.  We have taken it off the bed and I'll probably just have to throw it in the garbage because it's too heavy and bulky to store anywhere.  What a waste of money this was!

I ordered this extremely expensive king size latex topper. I traveled for several weeks hadn’t even slept on it very much until just past the return datesee picturesbegan  to disintegrate,crumble huge mess with balls of latex all over bedding and floor have to vacuum just terrible. One person sleeping in this bed not much wear and tear piece of junk. No idea how to contact the companyDo not buy, do not buy!if someone could let me know.Began to do this after just a few weeks of use. No longer have box or packaging information, And have more important things to do but this is horrible.

I am not sure if it is the baking sold I was told to use to help reduce the strong odor or if it is the actual latex but I have had a rash off and on every since I started using it.  I tried to remove all of the baking soda but once it got it in the holes I am sure it is not possible to remove it all.  It also sleeps very warm for me.  I have been covering it with several sheets to try to help with the hot sleeping part and cover the latex but it is just not working out for me.  I am considering another mattress cover to put over it because it does help with my pain but I am not sure it it will help.  I do notice that when I am gone camping for a week or so I do not have the rash problem so I am pretty sure it is the mattress or the baking soda stuck in the mattress.

I looked at many toppers and the reviews, and thought this would be a good one. We purchased it a few months before trying it, and then found out it was way too soft, especially for 2 people sleeping in it. It gave me backaches and I was sore every morning.I gave it time to see if I would adjust to it, but I did not.So I tried to contact the seller, and ask if we could get one that was much more firm. I never heard back, and unfortunately, the window for return has passed... the $200 topper is still here, but not being used. I would be happy if they would offer an exchange for a topper that was more dense and supportive.NEW UPDATE:: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!We heard from the CEO who took care of the issue. He is sending a box to send it back, and has refunded what we paid, and will have his team give us better advice on what topper to buy next time. FANTASTIC TO SEE THIS CONCERN FOR THE CUSTOMER.

I have trouble with pain in my hip and shoulder while sleeping. I bought my 1st latex topper about 12 years ago (different brand). It was great, but after ten years, I decided to replace it. A year ago, I bought this soft, 3”, latex topper. Over the year, it has gotten progressively harder, and I am back to waking up with shoulder/hip pain. I realized tonight that I am no longer sinking into the topper, it’s not soft. It’s gotten so hard that I’m on the very top, like I use to be on the traditional spring mattresses. I would not buy this topper again.

Ugh!  I'm so disappointed in this product, it actually gives me anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.  We purchased the 2" soft topper for our queen size extra-firm mattress.  The mattress is only a year old, and high quality, but it was making my shoulders sore.  We chose to try this latex topper instead of memory foam because we didn't want to sleep hot, and didn't want the feeling of sinking into memory foam, struggling to turn over.  To our  dismay, this latex topper makes absolutely no difference in the comfort of our bed.  None.  My shoulders are still killing me.  Even worse, this topper overwhelmingly reeks of rubber.  We aired it out for a day before using it.  It's been on our bed now for well over a month, and the smell has not dissipated at all.  The rubber odor is absolutely overwhelming.  I feel like it's ruined our bed.  Sure wish I could return this thing.  Heed my warning:  Do not buy it!!!

This mattress pad helped fix the hard purple bed we ordered; however, this mattress pad outgasses severely.  In other words, this mattress gives off an almost odorless gas.  My wife says she doesn't smell it and it doesn't seem to bother her.  Myself I am getting extreme migraines from the order and I can't even be in our bed room now without having trouble breathing and starting to develop a headache.I will update this review in 30 days.Update:  I wanted for 60 days to update this review.  We hung this mattress topper in our downstairs laundry room that had a fan vent.  The mattress hung flat on a web rope fully open for 2 months.  Last week we took it down and put it on our bed.  It is still outgassing badly.  About half as bad as before but still bad enough for us to wake up with headaches and all day confusion.  This mattress is totally poison and should be avoided at all costs.  There is nothing here green about this mattress topper except the price.  Not good.

I've had this topper for over three months in a room with an air purifier going constantly and it STILL smells like burnt rubber. And we also smell like burnt rubber in the morning when we get up. I wish I had returned it but I thought that surely the smell would fade. No. It seems as strong as the week we first got the thing. Also, this is my second 3" latex topper (the other one I bought 10 years ago from a different seller) and this one is less supposed to be 3" but is actually less than 3" and just seems to be overall inferior. It doesn't give as much support and cushion as our other one, though they are supposed to be the same in terms of what they are, how thick, and how plush. I think this is just a cheap item, cheaply made, and probably incorrectly made (hence the burnt lingering smell).

Was somewhat comfortable at first but in less than a year we are waking up with pain and pressure points in shoulders, arms and legs. Now we are looking for something else.

For a long time, I wanted to try a latex topper since it is supposedly better than memory foam.  I've read some of the bad reviews, but didn't think too much of them -- I really wanted it to work.  Now, after  3 months since I ordered this 1" pure latex topper. I finally gave up on it.  I used it for a total of 3 nights.  The first time, it smelled bad and it was too hot. I re-read some of the reviews, and decided to air it out in the garage for 3 months, and waited until the summer is over to try it again.  I tried the 2nd and then 3rd time, but it got progressively worse. The smell was still bad, it was still too hot, and I woke up with pounding headaches.  I don't know how anyone would rate this product anything by 1 star (or less).  What a waste of time and money!

It’s hot to sleep on, also more difficult to move in during your sleep time

WOW! This changed our life my husband is a disabled veteran who suffers serious back pain. He was unable to get comfortable on our mattress, he was in so much pain in the morning, and he was so cranky all the time. After we got this, he is able to get a good night sleep and have some relief from his pain. Even I would wake up still groggy and tired with our mattress but with this I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. Sleeping on this gives us the best nights of sleep we have ever had! UPDATE: it has been a few months and it has deteriorated so much. I wake up in pain again and am not sleeping well. We cannot get comfortable. Where we lay now has an impression of our bodies that doesn’t go away. I was hoping this would last longer but cheap quality I guess.

I bought this in June 2019 to replace a 3 year old memory foam that was causing me severe pain in my arms and shoulders.  I have fibromyalgia, so need a topper to prevent pressure points. I sleep on my back, since side sleeping causes severe pain in neck, shoulders,, and hip. My arms and shoulders started healing, then got worse. I was back to severe pain again and my right arm was pretty much useless and had very limited movement. I kept a memory foam topper at my daughter's. We just visited and my arms and shoulders got better with much better movement. So I brought it home and ordered a memory foam again. Not everyone will be able to sleep on this topper, I couldn't. It is very comfortable, but it causes me much, much pain.  I can NOT tell someone NOT to buy it, since it may work for someone else quite well. Not me, unfortunately.

I bought this to make our sleep number bed more comfortable. I bought the 2” king size. We love it! It provides extra pressure point relief but we can still feel when we adjust the bed underneath.Update: I’ve had this for a year and recently slept on it without a mattress protector, just a set of sheets and OH MY GOD! I smell so strongly like chemicals that it’s 1 am and I’m about to shower to get it off my skin. What’s more alarming is that for the past year my mouth has felt like sandpaper in the morning and since we’ve changed our mattress that has gone away. Until tonight when I tried sleeping on this topper in the guest room. That terrible feeling is back in my mouth along with a terrible chemical odor all over my body and favorite pillow. I’m honestly really scared now to think of what I’ve put my body through for the past year.

I’ve had this topper for almost 3 years. IT STILL SMELLS BAD. Not exactly like rubber, but something else. Toxic… I dunno.  I’m finally kicking it to the curb. I tied a ring it outside for days in the shade, baking soda, fabreeze. I just loved with it and put another mattress cover on top to help the smell. I even washed it in my bathtub! That helped a little. I decided that it’s probably not doing my health any good and ordered a new one from a different company… hoping this one won’t smell.Support and comfort are the only reasons I held onto this long.

I’ve been reading up on the best toppers for mattresses and came across latex toppers. I had a memory foam one from bed bath and beyond which I’ve had for 3 years and wasn’t bad at all but after all my research latex was considered to be better. So I spent a little more and got this one and I regret it. I’ve had this one for 2 years and it’s heavy and has two huge dents in it I guess from our bodies. I didn’t think this topper was capable of that. I thought after spending the money on a “latex topper” it would somewhat help with aches and pains (i’m Only 38) but i got the opposite effect. The memory foam one was so much better. The latex comes off easy whenever I have to move my bed around or flip the topper because of the dents. I didn’t like it one bit and regret buying it.

I have never written a review but I rely on them from others so I felt I needed to let you know. This topper made me very sick. Fumes are not the smell, they are compounds that are in the air. It even made me sick when it was in the garage and I was on the way to my car. I couldn't have gotten rid of it fast enough. I don't know if I am the canary and am super sensitive or the only person affected by it but just to let you know, it gave me brain fog and I felt ill for the whole day. I don't take medicine and eat healthy so when Im off I try to pinpoint why. It became obvious and now that its gone, I feel great. It was super comfortable though so the stars are accurate.

This is the worst purchase I have made: the mattress reaks of a chemical and just a nasty smell that permeates anything near it, clothes, bed sheets, bed pillows, bed room air. It stinks so bad that after months of trying to "deorderize it" by rinsing w water, out in the sun for 3 days, essential oils, room sprays, windex -anything I could think of, this stinking mattress is outside in the shed, and the SHED SMELLS. Stinking up everything I have stored so ater all this I cannot retun it because the 'return window' has closed and I will have to pay to have it taken to the dumps- a $350 waste of my hard earned money.

I bought this a year and two months ago and it still smells. When I get out of bed, my bedclothes smell like the latex topper. I air it out every day.  My previous latex topper from a different company did not have an odor. I am disappointed since  it cost a little more than some other choices.  I wish I had bought a different brand. I am sick of the smell and am thinking of tossing it. This  is my second review and the seller never bothered to respond. The first review was after using it for three months. Buy from someone else.

Update: within 45 days the foam was too soft and had collapsed on both sides of the bed I sleep on. My bed is now lumpy and difficult to get out of, and sleep on, I am seeking a warranty refund/replacement but it seems doubtful. I am heartbroken as I can’t afford another topper, and this one is a scam.Original: I am in love with latex/hybrid matresses. Got this topper for my parents’ guest room. It is surprisingly hot! Hotter than memory foam pads ive tried, and totally the opposite of my hybrid at home that sleeps very cold. Im concerned it is not true latex, it is very soft. But otherwise it “fixed” that unbearable firm mattress. Not sure if i should return.

Looses bounce after only few month and becomes useless. I bought 3” medium firm and 2” soft, both lost bounce, I ended up waisting lot of money.

I slept good on it but its smell permeated into my bedding, clothes, pillows and stuck on my mattress. I had to use baking soda and a vacuum to remove the smell from the top of my mattress. Not safe - who knows what chemicals you're inahling?

I bought this as it states its Natural, Green and Organic. Once I unpacked, I could smell a strong toxic chemical scent. We laid it out on our outside patio for an entire day - still had a smell but I hoped it would go away. It never did. The smell was consistently toxic. This one may be a one off but wanted to share in case anyone else experiences the same.

We bought 2 of the 3” thick mattress toppers. They are comfortable, BUT, they smell horrible!  Its almost nauseating at times. I contacted sleeponlatex and their representative said that it’s normal and that it is not toxic. Oh that’s great answer, I mean who cares if it smells horrible and I can’t sleep well because of the odor!  So, it’s perfectly normal for it to smell really bad.  Seriously I’m out $500 and their best answer is it’s normal; Update it’s been almost 2 months Purchase date 2-7-2021 and still smells just as bad. I emailed the company today 4-5-2021 to try and get my money back. Will let you know how it goes.

Complete waste of money. Became flat within a couple of months. Useless.

We got the 2 inch topper. It keeps sliding a several inches a night . After 2 night ,a foot was lumped on the side of the bed! It's a new bed! I called Amazon and she recommended opening a bunch of boxes and putting pieces in it to get it back! I'm waiting to hear what the company recommends through Amazon because it has to be better than that. It's not like we can put it back in the box. This thing got huge (for a king bed) as it should have. I'm hoping the company is good enough to help. I can't wait until latex does better. I bought it because my small hometown bed store had a latex one to sell . It was 1000! I would have bought it but the salesman tried to make 500 off me just on that ,at 1500....

I decided to give this a try to bring some pressure relief to a very firm hybrid mattress that I bought from amazon, and this--the 2 inch soft pure green natural latex topper--just did not work for me.  Almost every memory foam topper that I've had has been more pressure relieving. Also, the smell was unbearable to me.  So, I returned this very quickly.  I would advise anyone.  If you're not accustomed to latex beds or toppers, see if you can try a latex bed or topper first before buying this.  The feel is quite different.

I like this. But, I would buy something softer next time. The one I bought is not quite enough to relieve compressing one's upper arm/shoulder when sleeping on the side. This latex is indeed a bit springier than memory foam as reported on various reviewing sites. This might make it better for sex?Later editing:I thought I had bought the medium firmness one. But, after checking again, it seems that I did buy the soft version. So, this company can't make anything softer.... Well, it's not soft enough to relive pressure points. I do have a cheaper memory foam topper from JCPenney (Isotonic IsoCool which I bought at a gamble before I found The Wirecutter review site) for comparison. I like the memory foam better.I'll note that I did buy the 2'' latex topper while I'm comparing it with a 3'' memory foam. Maybe it's not a fair comparison? I don't know, but it's all have to compare. At the very least, I'd say I would definitely get the 3'' version of this latex topper over the 2'' to see if it works better. But, I'm skeptical since the latex is springier & harder than the memory foam so that I can't see that another inch of this is going to improve things significantly (Anyway, it's an empirical question that can be answered....)Yes, it's true that you sink into memory foam. So, if you don't like that, then this latex topper better than foam. However, apparently you have to sacrifice softness to avoid that.Yes, the memory foam is a bit hotter than the latex. However, I didn't buy the best memory foam topper in the first place. So, maybe spending more will get you a memory foam that is just as good heat-wise as this latex? In the future, I'd take my chance with memory foam hoping that more cash brings it closer to latex. I do like the holes in this latex topper. (Is that all it takes to make this topper cooler???)What to do now? I'm going to try to fit another down alternative topper to put on top of this topper. I'm curious about down alternative toppers in this first place (you can't really know until you try for a several months) and hoping that down alternative + this 2'' latex will be a success. Well, I guess it sounds like failure, doesn't, haha?Smell. I think there was an odor right out the box. But, it dissipated. Totally fine now. I obviously don't have the smell issue that other reviewers are mentioning. (Inconsistent quality control? I don't know.)Also, gotta mention price. Now (2021 Jul) this topper is 1.28x more expensive than it was in 2020. It probably didn't get than much better in a year. (And, most folks' salaries probably didn't increase by much in a year either.) Just looking worse for the review....Ok, so final verdict. This latex topper does make my old guest bedroom mattress better. But, it's not good enough. For pressure point relief, buy the 3'' and not the 2''. But, better yet, probably just don't buy this. Do some research for a good memory foam. If you don't need pressure point relief, then this latex topper is probably fine. It's springy, feels nice.

I have used this topper for about 3 months.  It is super comfortable. I bought the company's cover too to encase it hoping to provide some protection since the latex can easily break apart chunks here or there and also the smell after 3 months is somewhat noticeable.But man I gotta go with 2 stars here because after 1 accident from a kiddo in bed the whole thing is ruined. I'm royally pissed. You can lightly spot clean but that is kind of disgusting. If you buy this MAKE SURE TO FIND A TOPPER PROTECTOR TO ABSORB EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LIQUID OR ALL IS LOST LIKE ME. I have a mattress protector already but the topper needs it's own. You don't want latex with spills or accidents from a kid or dog on them. The cover provides minimal protection and obviously doesn't absorb. The problem is finding a mattress protector for your topper itself. Wish the company made one.Lovely product but functionality wise if you're making a big investment like this you need a protector. I can't stomach shelling out another $250 for the topper and the cover then needing to find a mattress protector that'll fit the topper too. This sucks.

I thought this would be a high quality product, but it ripped so easily. I was so careful to move it and it ripped so easily. Very hard to maneuver and move this. Also this isn’t breathable at all like latex is supposed to be. I was hot whole time I was sleeping on it. I wish I could return it.

The topper is soft and bouncy, but I got this to sleep cooler on top of a hot memory foam mattress. It traps heat on its own, even without the memory foam underneath. So if you're thinking about moving to latex away from memory foam, because of the heat, it's not going to help.

Right now I am giving it four stars. This latex topper looks and feels amazing, but I am surprised hardly anyone has mentioned the smell. It has a potent rubber smell, like a tire. I got the 2-inch and have aired it out for over a week, and I can still smell it. It's not too strong in the air now, but up close the smell is very noticeable. Touching it directly is the worst because the smell transfers to my hands and stays until I wash them. It doesn't seem to transfer to fabrics though. For example, the first day I laid on it directly to test it out, and the smell transferred to all exposed body parts but didn't stick to my clothing. I don't want to deal with a return, so I'll be keeping it regardless but am hopeful over time the smell becomes a non-issue. I will definitely update if the smell persists.Edit (4-18-18):It's been a few weeks now, and I can still smell the latex. I covered it and the mattress together in a bamboo zip-up mattress protector. On top of that is a plush bamboo topper. Then I've got my sheets on it. The smell is still there, but it's not overpowering. I can live with it. As far as comfort goes, it seems to be getting slightly softer as it is broken in, which is great. My first couple nights were miserable, but now I sleep great. No major regrets so far.Edit (7-11-18):I finally decided to bump my review down to 2 stars. Several months have gone by, and it's still very firm. It softened slightly but not nearly enough. I regret spending so much money.Edit (11-22-19):The smell is finally gone. Nothing else about it has changed though.

We had this for maybe 2 years, it ripped within the first two months. . It added a minimal amount of softness to the mattress. I originally purchased it because I was concerned about harmful chemicals in other mattress toppers. But I would recommend finding another product.

I would not order again, the topper was about 2-3 inches bigger than my full size mattress and it looks like this topper was patched . (See photo)  however the odor was not horrible.

I like that this topper has no chemical smell and is as advertised according to its dimensions. However, the 2" soft just isn't as supportive as it claims to be. I already have a hard mattress that causes me to wake up with a sore back. I got the soft based on the reviews and the recommendations on the Sleep On Latex website, but it's actually made matters worse. This topper causes me to wake up with sore spots all along my spine. The soft is not supportive and is no where near as firm as many reviewers claim. I find the softness to be comparable to a pillow-top mattress, with your body just sinking into it without much push back to support the spinal column.I'd like to return it and maybe get a medium but because I would have to pay for shipping costs, it probably isn't even worth it to send it back. What a waste!Update: Originally, this topper was not comfortable at all. I used it for about two weeks and during that experienced a great deal of back pain. I took it off my mattress with an intention of returning it, but since it was such a hassle to box up, it ended up sitting on the floor of bedroom in the clear plastic bag that it was shipped in for about three weeks. The deadline to return the topper passed and so I decided to try it again. I set the topper up as I had done before, right on top of my mattress and then with an inexpensive cotton mattress pad on top of that. This time, I experienced no back pain and actually found the topper comfortable. It no longer felt as "squishy" as it did before. Perhaps exposure to the air helped to stiffen it a bit? I'm not sure how, but it definitely changed for the better.Update 3/24/2016: It's been nearly six months since I've had this topper. I haven't been having great sleep but it's been decent until recently when I started to experience the same back pain that I had experienced initially. The back pain is so severe that it wakes me from my sleep. Worst sleep ever, for several days. This topper wasn't very supportive to begin with, so I don't know whether it's started to lose the little it had over time.

I was looking forward to a solution for a too firm bed.  This topper was recommended on a reputable independent review site and odor wasn't mentioned.  But this topper's strong odor was a deal breaker.  Several reviews mentioned that, so I expected it, but hoped that with airing it out it would be ok.  I opened the package, unrolled the topper and left it in the room for a while, and when I came back the whole room was filled with an unpleasant smell.  It was a lot stronger than I expected, and the information sheet in the package stated only that the odor will "dissipate to some extent over time".  The wording of that doesn't inspire confidence that it would ever be dissipated enough to be bearable.  Maybe some people won't be bothered by it, but if you are sensitive to smells, and plan to put it in a small room without a lot of ventilation, don't buy this topper.  Too bad that the product description on Amazon doesn't warn the buyer up front.  It was hard to roll back up and get it into the box!

see the photos taken. i never thought to exam the topper but my husband did today when changing the sheets. i have been complaining to him about my back pain is coming back and didn’t think the latex topper has something to do with it given it’s only been less than 6 months. well the 2in topper is not 2in anymore in the center. for your reference i’m 6’3 and 105lbs.

It wasn't just the smell that kept me up but I simply couldn't get comfortable.  Originally meant to help with pressure points on shoulders and hips but no relief to the point where I had to take it off the bed around midnight.  Was trying to save money without buying a new mattress.

Well, I live alone and this 3" latex topper weighs 36 lbs!  UPS dropped it off on my porch but I couldn't even slide it, let alone bring it into the house or set it up.  I just didn't know that it would be too heavy for me to budge, so I didn't even get to try it out.  Fortunately, both Amazon and the Pure Green customer service representative made it very easy to have UPS come back out to pick it up.  Now I'm starting over again and buying a 2 inch memory foam topper since memory foam weighs less than latex.  16 lbs. instead of 36 lbs.  Just a heads-up should any of you out there not be super strong or have someone you can tap to put it on the bed, rotate it, etc...

I have a standard size twin mattress and this is much too long. The mattress itself came vacuum packaged well and is listed as a “standard twin”. It is comfortable and cooling as far as the material goes however it is way too long and it looks hideous under a sheet with how it flops over both ends. It’s too cumbersome to fit back in the packaging and too expensive to package and ship back so I just have to live with it….every day.It’s pretty expensive so I wouldn’t recommend purchasing this product unless you have an extra long mattress.**update the seller was very helpful and able to make the situation right, they stand by their product and provided excellent customer service**

Sagging and found tear on the backside- I bought the cover for it, and they shipped it that way, when I opened it up I found the tear that is contributing to the sagging. I bought this 3-inch mattress topper because they sold me on the natural latex and switched to this type. I needed the 3 inches because I have two blown discs in my lower back. However, in only 2 weeks, I'm seeing a significant sagging in the middle of the mattress already, almost 3/4 inch, a noticeable dip in the mattress. This is practically the same dip I noticed with the Talalay mattress after 3 years.  I only weigh 180 pounds at 5'9". The underside mattress is practically new and flat, almost in new condition.  I do not have any confidence that this will be anywhere durable as the Talalay mattresses I used before. The claims that this is more durable - "Our latex foam scored a 99/100 on the LGA physical properties test for exhibiting extraordinary performance and durability. "... seems to be completely out of hand and perhaps a hamfisted claim. I am still waiting for a response from the company. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I don't like spending $202.57 for a mattress topper that lasts a month! I also noticed that there is no mention of the warranty- any time period-

Should have written this a year ago when I bought the topper.  The 3" topper collapses und the weight of my body offering no comfort or relief.  I could understand that if I were a 250lb hulk but  I am 5.4" and in the 120's.  Full disclosure that I did put it on top of a firm mattress (which after a year turns out to be a mistake)  I returned it and bought the subrtex 3 Inch Gel-Infused Memory Foam Bed Mattress Topper High Density Cooling Pad Removable Fitted Bamboo Cover Ventilated Design-10 Years Warranty.  I have not had a pain-free night for a year both in my hips and lower back. whether or not a topper really works depends on the bed.  As I said, I have a firm mattress which is virtually irredeemable because the toppers just collapse to the mattress firmness.  As a small woman that is perplexing!  So, I am getting a new bed that is plush with a pillow top!

For the price of this mattress topper I feel the quality is quite lacking.  When I opened it up out of the box and lay it on my bed it easily tore on the sides as I very gently was trying to center it over the mattress.  I have had other toppers that cost less than $100 that never ever did this in ten years.  That said I tried it for several weeks before deciding to return it.  I opted for the soft version as the company recommended it for side sleepers.  I found that the foam provided no support and almost completed flattened out with the weight of my body on it.  I think had I been a back sleeper it may have been okay despite the fragile quality that causes it to tear so easily when even slightly moved on the bed.I just feel that $200.00 for this was way over priced.  I realize that you pay more for latex but my last topper was less than $100 and was regular memory foam and provided much more comfort and durability than this.  I'd pass on this especially if you are a side sleeper seeking relief for your shoulder.  You won't find it with this one.  Also if you buy it better have four people moving it on the bed or it will tear assuredly.

purchased the soft topper and 1½ years later it sags in the middle and is quite uncomfortable.  this is a $230.00 (US) mistake.  fortunately the mattress is firm so all I'm gonna lose, besides the money, is some height.

At first I really like this topper. It is cooler than memory foam, slightly. We got a soft 2 inch and it's supportive enough without causing pressure points(the memory foam mattress underneath is extremely firm so we need a little bit of cushion.)But the smell is awful. I didn't notice it at first, it seemed to grow over time. I've tried to air it out a few times since putting it on the mattress and it helps a little but it seems to come and go. It smells like cigarette smoke and rubber together so I don't know if this is normal or if people smoke around the manufacturing plant. Or it was used.But my biggest problem now is that there are already indentations in it where we sleep. Not huge but seems like a decent dip for having this for only 3 months. I don't remember my memory foam toppers getting worn down this quick. We are not large people; 160 lbs (give or take 10 lbs) for both of us. I hope these indentations do not get any deeper, if so this will quickly become garbage. It still seems comfortable at the moment but when the husband starts complaining about his hips bothering him we know it's caput.

I placed this over a high-end firm latex mattress I’ve had for many years to help with night time hip and knee pain. At first, the pain seemed to improve, but after a few weeks, it came back. Now, after 2 months I’m disappointed that the mattress has a noticeable sag in the middle (I’m not a heavy person.)  I sleep on side, back and stomach get back pain when on my stomach with the topper (it is noted that the soft model is not good for stomach sleepers, so I don’t fault the product for this.) For the price tag, I expected more use before it would sag, especially since my mattress has very little sag after many years. I have reversed it, but expect it will just sag in a new place before long.  Would recommend a full mattress as a better investment than a topper.

I got the topper where holes were misaligned (holes from the back and the front of the topper did not match, effectively meaning that there were no through holes and therefore poor ventilation). Not sure whether this was the reason of such poor performance, but this thing made my bed much firmer and more uncomfortable than before! It applied so much pressure on my joints that I woke up all in pain and could barely walk (I am about 140 lbs).I don't understand how a "soft" topper can make the already firm bed much firmer and more uncomfortable.

We purchased two of these toppers for our home. One of them looked exactly like the photo, the second one had a shiny rubber like texture on it. Not sure why they were so different when we purchased two of the same product? The one with the shiny surface also looks to have some sort of grease spots on it, on one part of the mattress.We decided we could live with the grease spots (the one with the shiny surface) - things happen in manufacturing, after all -  so we flipped it over and put it on my bed. It sleeps incredibly hot!  I am normally the "cold" person in the house (always wearing a sweatshirt, etc.) and usually have extra blankets on the bed. With this topper, I am down to sleeping only with a sheet, and so I then run into doing the hot/cold tossing and turning all night. I get too cold with just the sheet, but the minute I put even one LIGHT blanket on, I start to sweat and wake up throwing the covers off. So very frustrating!If you are looking for a mattress pad to soften your bed, this will definitely work, but be forewarned that it can make you uncomfortably hot while you sleep. :(

The product is probably comfortable but I have not yet slept on it.  I bought it as a topper for our guest bedroom as the mattress is a bit on the firm side.  Laying on it feels good, but the smell of (burnt) foam rubber was absolutely terrible when we first opened it up.  I have been airing it out in the bedroom with a ceiling fan on for about 3 weeks now hoping that the smell would disappear.  It has not.  The smell is less but still very noticeable.  You can smell it just walking past the doorway to the room.  I don't believe I would be able to sleep on it for more that a few minutes.  I have purchased a natural latex 2" topper and also a 12" thick natural latex King size mattress from another company and they were both odor free.  Something in the manufacturing process of this topper is allowing the overpowering smell to remain in the product.  Maybe a specific final washing/rinsing method?  Anyway - some people may be able to tolerate the smell but I cannot.  I am going to return it.

Queen size 2" 100% latex. The smell is the number 1 reason I'll be returning this product. It's been almost two weeks now and it still stinks up any room it's in to the point it smells like you walked into a latex glove factory. It smells like the factory where all things latex are produced. If you have asthma don't get this product. You'll have to find something more expensive that has no odor at all. The smell is so strong that it doesn't matter if it's technically toxic or not. It still hinders my breathing. It's like a thick fog of latex smell that feels heavy and hard to breathe in. I've let it air out in various open air positions with the ceiling fan on. Even hung it over the edge of an indoor balcony for a week. It's not losing it's strong odor. Other then that it felt fine to sleep on at first. Until you wake up and your back is so stiff you can't walk right in the morning. For me personally this is unusable. I'm a side and stomach sleeper with back issues and find it was better for me to sleep on my uncovered firm mattress than to use this latex topper.

I used this topper for 3 years. All in all good pressure relief but it does compact over time.  However I noticed today that the underside of the topper that was sitting on the mattress has mold. Inside some of the holes in the topper there was what appears to be mold. Luckily it doesn’t seem to have spread to the mattress. I do not have water or humidity problems in my home. Time for a different topper!

This mattress topper has a terrible chemical smell. After 10 nights, the off-gassing still causes my kids and me to have burning throats/noses and headaches. If it was feasible to send it back I would.If you don’t mind the burn in your nose and throat, it feels very comfortable on top of a firm (natural latex that doesn’t smell like a chemical factory) mattress.Overall, this was a really big waste of money and I would not recommend this product. Now I have to figure out how to get this thing out of my house so I don’t have crying kids every night.Update: I threw this thing away because the smell was so bad and my entire apartment was nearly unbearable. When I got it out of the house, I was devastated to discover that the smell had caused my mattress to smell. The mattress was a new natural latex mattress that I had about a month before I got the topper. I had no issues with the mattress when the topper was ordered. I am about to have to replace my mattress. This product should not be purchased if you have ANY sensitivity to smells/chemicals.

After about the first week I started noticing my entire body leaving an indentation of heat  The moment I moved in bed in the middle the night  because the other parts of the sheets filled so cool  and soothing.  I have an oscillating fan right next to my bed and my air-conditioner gets pretty freezing cold but I still find myself feeling hot constantly in the middle the night.  I Have never been a hot natured person in fact I’m always  The person has to have a blanket when im taon the couch just because I like feeling warm and cozy.I’m not sure if it’s the  other layers I have underneath.  The layer immediately underneath this 3 inch topper is  2 inches of regular foam,  underneath that is 2 inches of memory foam.  I faced the memory foam farthest away from the top of the bed but the memory foam is attached to the regular foam.  It felt great the first couple weeks sleeping on his bed concoction,  but after a while I realized I do miss the bed with a slight movement of springs.  I’m seriously considering having to get a whole new bed again.

I bought this back in October and since I love natural products and buy organic whenever I can, I thought this would be a great non-toxic solution for us. Once I opened the box I could smell an overpowering stink so I put it in my garage with the windows open to off-gas for 3 full weeks.  Then it still smelled but I needed to use my garage, so I put it on my bed with 2 mattress pads, and 2 bottom fitted sheets and it still smells so much 2 months later that when I roll over at night I get whiffs of the smell and my pajamas stink.We could have lived with the smell had the sleep quality improved a lot.  I have a $2500 Temperpedic mattress so center sagging is not the issue, we just wanted a little bit more softness to the bed so decided to try this option.  The problem is that now we wake up with sore backs, so this is no the right option for us.  And unfortunately the return window has closed so now I don't know what to do with it.  Grrr...

Looks like there was rodent damage or disintegration prior to shipping. Not sure how well this item will last.

This topper was very comfortable but then about 6 months after purchase it has a permanent dip where my bottom is.  I purchased a queen 3" thick for comfort and pain control. I only weigh 105# so I don't understand why it made the dip.  I started flipping and turning every month but the same dip appears in the same area.  I thought if I spent the money for better quality I wouldn't get the dip but didn't matter.  Use to get just regualar soft latex foam topper and the same problem would occur.  So back to same problem at a higher cost.

Purchased this latex topper hoping it would fix our rock of a  mattress...It didn't.  Topper arrived well packaged and on time.  Was heavy but managed to get it on bed myself and unwrap it.  Strong odor but let it air out a few days before putting it in the cover.  Topper was several inches too wide and too long for our queen mattress so had to cut it in order for it to fit inside the cover, (made by same company).  With the cover and sheets on, it masked the remaining odor well enuf.  After abt a week odor was no longer noticeable but this thing is NOT soft at all.  It also has formed deep dips where my husband has been laying on it.  Even with turning every time sheets are changed. (It can't be flipped without removing the cover since it has a grippy type underside.)  Topper is not rebounding as hoped and husband now wants it gone.  If I didn't have to cut it to make it fit in the cover, this thing would have been returned.

I bought the 3-inch topper. It is very comfortable but I spend the entire night trying to sleep in a puddle of sweat. I toss and turn and wake up a dozen times per night, sheets soaked and cold. (After reading manufacturer responses to other reviewers claiming that this topper is super-hot, I've no doubt that they will respond "there are many factors that can make a bed hot" so they can deny it's their product causing it. So I'll say right here that I NEVER had a problem roasting like a chicken in my bed UNTIL I PUT THIS SLEEP ON LATEX TOPPER ON MY MATTRESS.) I'm really sorry that I missed the return window because I don't want it anymore and it was expensive! It also seems quite fragile. I tore some of the holes just positioning it on my bed. Also made my mattress so thick that none of my sheets fit anymore, and they're all the super-deep-pocket type. Would not buy again, at least not at this price. Very unhappy that I'll have to toss this in the trash after spending so much money on it.

I am returning this because I am allergic to this mattress. I have slept on it twice and both nights my skin started itching and burning shortly after lying on it. I am using a slipcover on the mattress pad but some of the latex must have transferred to the top of the pad when I put it on. I can't wear latex gloves due to itching so I figured out right away that this was a latex allergy problem. I saw nothing in the product description about avoiding this latex mattress pad if you have any history of latex allergies.  I bought it because I had read articles that the process for making latex mattresses is different that latex medical equipment and is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.I am going buy another Red Nomad - King Size 2 Inch Thick, Ultra Premium Gel Infused Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad Bed Topper which I have on another bed. I feel it gives more support and sleeps cooler that this one. I will just have deal with the off-gassing for a few days and air out the house.

The objective when buying this was to reduce the firmness of a Novaform Comfortgrande queen costco mattress.This foam was just too soft to provide any real support (I'm 160 lbs), so what ends up happening is the foam completely compresses down to the original mattress surface. Then you have 2" of uncompressed foam surrounding your body. Because of this, airflow is limited and these areas become hot and sweaty, even in winter. Keep in mind, I was only using a sheet directly on top of this foam topper. I imagine adding a cotton/polyester cover would help with the breath-ability and heat reduction. I would recommend the soft version of this topper in the 1" version, but only as a plush pillow topper to a mattress that doesn't already have one built in, the 2" thickness is just too much and feels suffocating. I will probably try the firm or medium firm version of this topper next. As far as the material goes, this brand seems worth the money, there is a slight odor, but it's a natural one and dissipates quickly. Be careful moving this topper because it feels like it could tear without much effort.

I have ordered, in total, three of these toppers. The first one was great! It was cut to the right size, nice and comfortable to sleep on, and the price was great. The second one was okay. Still cut to the right size, still comfortable, but the smell has still not fully gone away, after owning it for over a year. The third one is cut wrong (I ordered a king, and it's several inches short both ways), and the smell is very strong. I am hoping the smell will go away with time, as it did with the first topper, but I admittedly worry it will stay.

I really wanted to love this mattress topper but I just can’t. I have tried the memory foam ones and they are comfy but I don’t like that “sucked in” feeling. This latex one has pros and cons which I will list below. I personally don’t believe it is worth the cost but I don’t want to deal with the headache of returning it.Pros: Alleviates pressure point pain. Doesn’t retain body heat as much as memory foam. Doesn’t “suck” you in like memory foam.Cons: Latex smell is still strong after 1 week which can cause irritation and make sleeping difficult.  Not as soft as memory foam. I have only used it one week and it already has an “body impression” like spot that you roll onto (I am not a heavy person).Conclusion: In some ways this is better than the memory foam mattress toppers but I don’t believe it is worth the extra money.

Very disappointed. Rubber odor was overwhelming despite airing it out 24/7 for 4 weeks in a sealed room with open windows, or on a mesh chaise lounge on a screened in patio in full wind. Filled the whole house with the intolerable odor day 1, when it got into the A/C system. In the sealed (duct tape under the door & taped close A/C duct) cabana bath with the open window, the towels, rug, & curtain absorbed the strong odor also. Has off-gassed considerably by now, but still cannot tolerate in same room even when covered all around with a mattress pad, which takes on the odor. I have had a latex mattress & 3 other latex mattress toppers for years, with never this experience. I hope it is an anomaly with this specific mattress topper. Otherwise, lovely soft, springy & supportive, unlike ridiculous "memory" gel foam. Manufacturer has sent me a larger box & shipping label for a return, as this topper came shrink-wrapped & cannot be fit back into original box. Received new box Saturday 1/28, & will be able to make post office hours & return Saturday 2/4.

I bought this because I thought it was more environmentally friendly than memory foam. I always wondered what it means for a bed to be too soft. Well, with this, I can tell you in detail. It is so soft that if I sleep with a pillow, it drives my hips into the bed and leaves my Back sore. Really most of my back is sore because it has been unnaturally stretched all night long. I’m glad there is a sustainable option instead of plastic. But now I feel terrible that I wasted resources purchasing this. And I’m going to have to waste more replacing it. Worst sleep I’ve ever had. There is an odor, I’ve heard it describe “like sugar cane”. After sleeping in this all night, you WILL smell like “sugar cane” in the morning. I’m completely exhausted from several days of lack of sleep. Considering sleeping on the floor. Just desperate for the replacement to arrive as quickly as possible. Worst bed I’ve ever slept in in my entire life.

The cellular structure collapsed after four months. I Purchased this to help with my bad back, but after four months, because of lack of firmness it began to contribute to back soreness in the morning. I kept it on the bed, simply trying to get my moneys value out of it but now I am going to remove this from the bed and would not purchase this item again.Another reason for the low rating is there is absolutely no product support. There isn’t anybody talk to about issues.

The product is high quality. Customer service is great. So why only 2 stars? Because these things just don't work. If your mattress is too hard, your hips and shoulders will sink through the topper and mash against the mattress. All it does is add mushiness and heat to the bed so most of your body feels weird and mushy and the parts where you need pressure relief don't get any help. I hate to say it but the only way to fix a bad mattress is to buy a better one. Also if you think you're going to get free return, you might be disappointed to discover that once the foam is out of the box it won't fit back in it. They will send you a bigger box but they won't come to your address to pick it up. If you can't fit it in your car to drive it to a faraway pickup location, it will cost $24 to have it picked up.

It's been a month and half since i bought this. I'd return it if i could, the material is too soft, i can easily compress the 3 inches of material between 2 fingers to about 1.5 cm.  Which I wouldn't consider anymore to be supportive or benifical.I suggest you all consider another product.For the $230 bucks, just buy a new matress like a purple. Because that's what I'm gonna do now.I like my marshmallow sheet. The smell for the first day was bad, but I still slept on it.A week or so later I have found it to still be very nice and plush, smell minimal.I vary if i want it to be more firm or notI am 6'1, 200lbs, side sleeper.My matress is an old bent in the middle spring matress, that i put 2*4s under to lift the sunken middle.

Very disappointing. Advertised 2 day shipping but took almost a week. It arrived shrink wrapped and was not comfortable. Trying to return it was a nightmare but I did get a refund.

If you are looking for a topper that cushions the hips and shoulders, this is not the one for you. I bought this knowing I would not have to deal with a smell or outgassing, but latex is not soft enough. It would be better to buy traditional memory foam and let it air. I have had to place an additional 1 inch memory foam on top of this to make it work for me. Very disappointed because it was too expensive  for me to be so.

I gave the rating 2 stars because if you like very soft, marshmallow like sleeping, you really will love this topper. Everyone is right, it does not smell too bad, though there is some latex odor, which is not strong. The size is very generous, and it's nearly 50 lbs so it's heavy. BUT I have to score this item low because of the misleading description which boasts that it is 3" firm. There is NOTHING firm about it. I have scoliosis, and cannot sleep on soft mattresses. We got this to help firm out memory foam mattress (which is only 2 years old) - I didn't sleep well for the first two nights, thinking I should give it a chance. By night number 3 I slept on the couch, and the next day we prepared it to ship back. My husband didn't mind it much, but he also doesn't need the support quite like I do.

I tried it 2” version for approx 2 weeks. It feels nice and plush to lay on. But feels too soft to sleep on. It took some time to get used to (which I understand can be a thing for a sleeping surface). But Ultimately it DID feel hotter even in winter use. Neither my 100ish pound wife or my 230ish self liked the insulating feel or the lack of sleep comfort.  We have a nice full latex mattress from Costco which is a bit firm but ultimately I think it will work for us.  (We just got the mattress and I was afraid it might be too firm but seems fine so far).Also one of the pictures showed it with baked in stamps of authenticity on one side of the FOAM but it came with only a GOLS sticker on the box.

We ordered one of these for our bed from another company and LOVE it.  In an effort to save money I purchased this one for the guest room.  The smell is so strong I can't use it.  We left it in the garage with the windows open for weeks to air out but the odor won't leave.  It smells like new rubber bands times a thousand.  Finally tried it out so I could be sure.  We covered it with a mattress pad, bottom sheet, top sheet and thick microplush/sherpa comforter and I tried sleeping on top.  Woke up with a headache and entire room smelled.  It can't be healthy.  I plan to return it if I can wrestle it into a box.  It is comfortable and would be great if it didn't have such a strong odor.

This was a very comfortable and reasonably priced mattress topper.  I was very excited to get it, but after lying on it for about an hour (with a mattress pad and top sheet) my tongue, throat, and lips began to swell.  This has never happened to me before so it was shocking--all symptoms of latex allergy.  Online (mattress companies likely) say people who are allergic can sleep on latex but don't risk it. I have been recently diagnose with an autoimmune so that might be the issue.

Not heavy enough for sleeping on. Compresses too easily.

After reading all the reviews, we were very excited to get this topper for our very firm mattress.  The first few nights were heavenly, as I felt no pressure points on my shoulders or hips.  I even woke up the next morning realizing that I had stayed in the same position the entire night.  I was sold!7 days later... woke up with intense back pain.  This occurred the next day and the day following that.  I realized that though wonderfully soft, the latex material was not supportive enough for me.  I tried swapping the 3 inch topper for the 2 inch, thinking that this would allow more mattress support.  A couple days went by and the back pain was back.  Really wish it had worked out because I love the concept of latex and the customer service at Sleep On Latex are top notch.

This is what I needed! I have Fibromyalgia with chronic pain and tenderness which leads to soreness from even small pressure points or fabric bunching up.I also am very sensitive to smells, so I was a little worried some reviews said smell was strong.I'm super happy, I planned to open it and potentially leave in another room to expand and air out. To my surprise, when I unwrapped it from the plastic it quickly rolled out and was immediately to size!Completely shocked. It was really cool. If you have kids let them watch it pop to life.They do sell a nice cover for it however I have it under a mattress protector so I don't see a need.The smell was strong, however it didn't give me issues leave on the bed and sleeping on it the first night. Within a few nights I no longer noticed smell at all. Yay!Yes I still have constant pain, but it is not amplified by mattress anymore. Compared to memory foam that is under it it breathes a little better. Hot flashes are less intense and bed isn't soaked as before. I wouldn't say it's cooling though.Material has amazing bounce back similar to unrolling. While it was still on the floor I walked on it and jumped on it and it provided cushion, a little spring, and followed foot up as it was lifted. Memory foam doesn't return quickly and is NOT soft to quickly fall into.I like that this is a USA company and it is using natural material. Even not having cover saves when it is not needed.If you need a soft-med mattress because you have sore hips, knees, back, definitely consider this. Due to the amount of spring back and from what I've read about latex I'm looking forward to this lasting much longer then my cheap foam topper that was replaced on top of memory foam.What is great about getting twin sizes is you can have different toppers on each side of the bed depending on each person's needs.

My husband and I began our mattress debacle about 3 months ago. We innocently decided to shop for a new king-size mattress after going on vacation and sleeping great, then returning home and realizing it was time for our old mattress to be put out to pasture. We bought a medium-priced Beautyrest firm pillowtop from Macy's, and spent a miserable month tossing and turning until Macy's agreed to send a technician out to inspect.  He determined we had 1-1/2" body impressions on each side, and we're average sized folks. Crazy! After some haggling, we were able to return the mattress and box springs for a full refund and our quest continued. After MUCH reading on the internet, I discovered that mattresses are no longer made as in days of old - they cannot be flipped, and body impressions are very common within the first year because the memory foam that most are made from, does not spring back. We spent a day at Bedrooms and More in Seattle, a company that makes their own mattresses "the old way". The one we bought is a firm innerspring, tight-top (not pillowtop). It's a great place to shop, with reasonable prices. They even have a free mattress class that you can take before you buy, and encouraged us to turn the mattress 90 degrees once per month for 2 months, then flip over and start again. This will help avoid the lumps, bumps and dips over time.  However, the mattress is still a bit too firm for our liking, so I took the plunge and ordered the 2" soft, king-size Pure Green latex topper from Amazon.  What a dream!!  From the very first night, we both slept great, and the topper molded to hips, shoulders and elbows nicely, as we're both side-sleepers. It has really helped my arthritis pain. It is springy (but not annoyingly so), is not hot at all (like memory foam), and keeps its shape.  It's so comfortable that I don't want to get up in the morning!  I had a few questions, so I contacted the Sleep On Latex company thru the Amazon website, and had an answer from the owner within 24 hours!  Amazing. The moral of this story is - buy a firm innerspring mattress, and add a latex topper. Or, revitalize a tired mattress with a latex topper and you can buy yourself some time. The next thing on my wish list is a wool mattress pad...and a new topper for the RV - then we're all set!  Thanks for reading this long post. I had no idea that mattress shopping would be so complicated and hope this information will help someone else.

I never write reviews, but I feel that I need to this time because I need everybody to know how great the customer service is with Sleep on Latex.My sister purchased a 3" soft king topper and loved it so much that she purchased a 2" soft queen to put in her spare room. I borrowed the 2" after she raved so much about it. We both suffer from a connective tissue disorder that makes sleep uncomfortable. We wake constantly with subluxations (body parts that slip out of place), having to shift, roll over, etc., at least 20 times a night which can get old really fast. I borrowed the 2" topper from her spare room and had the best sleep of my life for two nights! I usually wake up at a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale in the morning until I can take my meds, but with this topper, I wake up at a 2 or a 3 out of 10 on the pain scale, which is huge!!!! I immediately ordered my own.I went bigger, however, and purchased the 3" soft topper instead of the 2" soft topper that I'd borrowed from my sister. I thought that bigger would be better! Unfortunately, I was wrong. When the 3" soft topper arrived, I realized that it was a *touch* too deep for me. It had the same soft/wonderful/cool support that feels like sleeping on a cloud, but it put me into a position that was awful.  I have to sleep on my side with a king pillow wedged in behind me for support, as well as a king pillow in front for support. I use a gel pillow under my head and the 3" topper was *just* deep enough that it tilted my head just a fraction beyond what is comfortable for my body and I was in agony :( I was so sad! I wanted it to work so badly but I couldn't bear it after a few nights as it was just a tiny bit too tall. (My spouse said the 3" was the same as the 2" just to give you some reference. I was the only one that noticed the change!) This is where the review gets awesome.I emailed the company, and literally within minutes, they responded. I had a return started with Amazon, they were shipping me a box big enough to return it (because my overzealous spouse had already recycled the BIG box that the 3" topper came in), and I purchased the 2" soft topper. In just a few days, I received the box, packed up the 3" topper to return, and had the new 2" topper on my bed. Sleep on Latex ordered a UPS pick up at my home at no cost to me, and I happily pushed the big box onto the front porch and went upstairs to flop down on my bed in relief.There were about eight emails back and forth to coordinate the logistics, and this was HANDS DOWN the best customer service I have ever received. Like, EVER! And that, to me as a consumer, is invaluable. They listened, responded, and problem-solved like pros.Oh, and I almost forgot....I didn't order the zippered cover when I bought the first 3" topper. I realized that I wanted it when I read other reviews about how much easier it made moving it around on the bed (it's super hard for me to bend over, and anything that makes my life easier to shift the thing around on my mattress is great. The topper is kind of...well....latex-ish when you don't have a cover on it so it's maybe 20% harder to move around on a big bed by myself. Don't get me wrong, it's not difficult, just...active. Putting sheets on the bed flows better when the cover is on, too! But you def don't NEED the cover if you don't want it. A mattress protector or other top sheet would be just fine if you don't want to spend the money, but the cover really does improve my experience with the topper. I don't share other reviews' frustration with the zip-off top, I thought it was very clever! That way, I can just zip off the top, wash it, and zip it back on without flopping the topper around by myself. Very smart!) Anyway, I ordered the cover, and my new 2" topper ARRIVED ALREADY INSIDE THE COVER. How great is that?!? Seriously. I appreciated that extra step SO MUCH and almost cried when I opened the box to see that. To me, that goes above and beyond what any company is required to do. That extra step meant so much.So, long review short, this 2" soft topper is a game-changer. I love it. It's worth every penny and I want to purchase them for every bed in my home.  It takes my already-bowed five-year-old memory foam mattress from sucky to amazing. The zip-off topper cover makes my life easier. The topper makes my nights better. It's just bouncy enough, my spouse doesn't feel my move around, it's nice and cool, and feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud. It keeps my pressure points supported, my bones don't slip out of place, I wake up rested and almost pain-free, and it's easy to maintain. (Oh, and because nobody else has mentioned it, it doesn't take away from romantic time, either :) )Buy this product. And buy it from this company. I'm so grateful!!! Thank you SleeponLatex!!!

After our last mattress topper went to the great mattress in the sky, we needed something else; or to invest in a new mattress. After getting sticker shock and being overwhelmed by all the mattress options I found a website that compares mattresses, mattress toppers and pillows. The site stated that for heavier people, side sleepers and couples this was one of the best options.  We decided after reading some of the other very helpful reviews on here to go with the queen 3" soft topper. It came in a smallish VERY heavy box (so if you have trouble lifting items make sure you will have help when this is delivered to you!)  We opened and unrolled the topper. We didn't leave it to air out because it was nearly bedtime, and I felt like the smell wasn't too awful. We have just regular depth fitted sheets and I was sure they wouldn't fit after seeing just how thick the mattress topper really was- however the sheets fit well. After sleeping on and changing the sheets sets several times now I am impressed that I din't have to go out and buy special fitted sheets to accommodate the topper! No problems at all with a normal fitted sheet covering both the mattress and topper, and absolutely no problems with the fitted sheet staying on all night over the topper.  5 stars for not making my life difficult!  As far as the smell, while it did smell some when opening- the smell has faded and is no longer an issue at all. 5 stars for not making me gag!  The comfort of the topper is very impressive. I was kind of anticipating comfort at first when laying down, but then throughout the night it not being as comfortable simply from being compressed by 2 bodies for hours. This is not at all the case! The topper remains comfortable all night long, not too springy and not too squishy. I was concerned that buying the soft topper would be too marshmallow-y, but I've got to say- I am so thankful we went with soft and not the medium! I thought being too soft would not give enough support and cause our backs to hurt, but it has done very well supporting and not overly cloudlike! 5 stars for comfort and support!  Now, the negative.... we bought and started using this topper in January, during a particularly frigid winter, often below zero. Our bedroom is very cold, and I have trouble staying warm no matter how many blankets we have! After adding the topper to our bed, I find myself kicking off some covers and waking because I am too warm. This worries me since it's winter and I'm too warm, what will it be like in the summer when our underinsulated room is hot? I am thinking the amount of body heat the synthetic topper holds may make sleeping in warmer conditions really unpleasant. So 4 stars (for now) for holding in heat and disrupting sleep. I will update in the summer, hopefully I won't have to knock off more stars!

I first ordered the medium firm, and it already felt infinitely better than the El Cheapo topper from Costco that I had been using.Close, but no cigar: it felt harder than I wanted. I contacted their customer service and they kindly suggested I return this medium one via Amazon, and order the soft one. They offered to send me a box to package the return. I just got the soft one and it really is wonderful. My body feels gently cradled, and I can side sleep now with comfort. Unlike previous toppers that smelled of terrible chemicals and that needed aerating for weeks prior to use, these came with a slight rubber smell, not unpleasant. I aerated them for a couple of days under a fan anyway, and the smell was no longer noticeable once in the cover. I’m very happy with this purchase and their customer service: years of good sleep ahead!

I decided to buy a new mattress from Beautyrest, a silver pillow top plush with no knowledge of the mattress scam. If you didn't know all 4 major brands are from the same factory, memory foam and other inferior forms of foam are hot and leave you sleeping in a hole on one of these mattresses after as little as a month. I am 125 lbs and 5'7, partner is 5'11,150 lbs, we already had indentations in our mattress after 1 month. I read up on the whole pillow top mattress scam and how memory foam is really crap, how people went though multiple Beautyrest  blacks, and Tempurpedics only to find out each one failed in the same way. Extreme sagging. Well, I did my research and now I have this on top of my one month old Beautyrest and it is a godsend. You will never sleep on what feels like hot sand again, like on memory foam, the latex is so soft and it's not toxic like memory foam.(I got the  2' soft).This is dunlop not talalay and I assure you talalay is NOT softer than dunlop, This topper is Firmness rating 20 ILD (soft). I find it plush, perfect for a top layer. I would use a firmer rating for the second and third layers as they do when they make pure latex mattress. What I am trying to say is if Zen Heaven or whomever is trying to tell you talalay is so much better than dunlop they are lying, they are just trying to charge you more money. This product is perfect, I just wish I had known about it before I bought an expensive innerspring. If your innerspring is really in bad shape you can even flip it over and throw one of these toppers on it, I hear it works like a charm. Stay away from memory foam, it really is crap. So hopefully I have saved my 1 month old Beautyrest silver from what others have gone though, and added a few years to it, because the way it was going it was bound for the dumpster in 6 months max. it's very comfortable now with this plush latex layer that is not hot on top of the Beautyrest crap pillow top that slept so hot I woke up sweating multiple Xs a night, plus is as softer than my Beautyrest rated a 7 for super softness and NO SAGGING. I recommend a firmer 3 inch if you have a more serious sagging problem than I did, but if you buy this you will not be sorry and it will outlast your mattress. I will report back in 3 months and let you know how it's holding up.Edit: I flipped over the Beautyrest innerspring because it already had such sagging on the pillowtop I wanted to rip off after just a month of buying it, it was too much. It continued to sag under the topper, so I took the plunge, flipped it, and now there is zero sagging and a 2” plush latex on top under my sheet, with the protector on the mattress because the latex sleeps so cool, I love it! I sleep like the dead and have no pain or ever wake up sweating, same with my husband who use to sweat puddles on memory foam. I saved a ton of money and my sheets still fit, I have always bought king for my queen.  So, don’t hesitate on a sagging pillowtop innersping and wake in pain. Flip it and add a few inches of latex, support AND plush comfort or firm support W/E, choose the one or layers that fit your needs. When this gives out this company has my lifelong business, I hear they make a great mattress and if I had more cash I would have bought one already, but this is working so perfectly so I have zero reason to spend more money. Couldn’t be happier.

This is my first time trying a latex topper and I wish I would have done it years ago! Bear with me on my review, I wanted to try to give the best all around opinion.I'm one of those people that have spent thousands of dollars on mattresses and toppers, trying to find some combination that works for comfort and pain relief. I have back issues and joint pain, to generalize my medical history. Not to mention, I'm getting old, which sucks. Suffice it to say, pain is constant with me.Then I tried this latex topper! Wow!I've tried all the different kinds of memory foam toppers out there and pretty much hated every single one. I don't like the 'sink in'  or 'sleeping in a cloud' thing. Yes, it seems somewhat comfortable. For about an hour.Then it's hard to move and makes my back hurt worse because of no support. Also, memory foam is hot too, and I hate to sweat while I'm sleeping. Uggh, gross!I've tried many of them. From cheap to expensive. Even every kind of thickness, none of them seemed to work, spending a small fortune.  I hate them. I ended up giving them away or tossed them in the trash. Such a waste of money.Now, this latex topper is a total game changer!  It's not anything like a memory foam, which after my rant, is a huge plus!It's comfort, softness AND support. I'm a skeptical person, could even call me cynical.  But the fact remained, I needed something to add to my mattress to relieve the pressure points. I'm a side sleeper mostly, occasionally sleeping on my back.This latex topper helped out sooo much! No more shoulder or hip pain, even easing some of my back pain. Wow!! Im amazed at it, really. All from 2 inches of latex.Mattresses are so different, as are people. So many different types and in every price range. Mattresses, not people.Higher prices don't make them better though. Neither do trends.So, I aimed for the decent inexpensive mattresses instead, settling on a lightweight innerspring poly foam one. It's actually more comfortable than the one I spent 2200 bucks on a few years ago. I tried an 10 inch all memory foam one too, and hated it. Gave that away.Now, my mattress shouldn't be that comfortable, right? It's not expensive or anything fancy to brag about, but it is the best mattress I've slept on. I can't sleep on firm beds, causes way too much pain. I need something soft but supporting my spine.But, if it's comfortable, why get a topper? Because I still needed something soft to help out with the lingering hip and shoulder pain. To add that extra layer of  softness and luxury that a good mattress should beg for. Beckoning to be crawled into at night.This 2 inch soft latex topper did that. It worked great at relieving the pain but supporting me thru the night. Allowing me to move around freely and wake up in way less pain. Together, it makes my bed super comfy now!! I look forward to going to sleep, knowing I'm going to wake up in less pain.My mattress is fine now, it's not sagging or in bad shape. Nor is it super thick. Only 10 inches, without the topper. I have no need to hack away at it, or flip it over or hope the topper 'fills in the gaps' from holes left by bodies constantly sleeping in the same spot. If my mattress was in totally bad shape, I'd just replace it. The topper is great but it's not that magical to fix a worn out saggy bad mattress.Honestly, I've already spent enough money on previous mattresses, just trying to find a comfortable one.  But the cost of the one I have now, was very affordable. At that logic, I could replace it regularly and still spend less than one I bought 8 years ago.They say it's recommended to get a new mattress every 7 years.7 years is the magic number for a lot of things, actually. Matresses, cars, houses, jobs, even spouses.I would recommend this topper to anyone and everyone!!The latex is not squishy-soft, in-a-cloud-like-marshmellows soft,  but more subtle, cushiony, supportive, almost bouncy softness.It does not sag, losing it's shape after laying on it for hours, but provides the support to keep you aligned. It does not need to 'bounce back' like memory foam because it does not squish down or form indents from your body shape that has to 'fluff' back up after hours, if it ever does.It did not have a smell to it, nor did I find the need to expose it to the elements either. Sunlight is great, but it can affect things differently. I found no instructions to put it outside, or to air it out. I simply unpacked it, put it on my mattress and let it be. Even with the door closed to my room, after several hours, there was no smell. Definitely no offensive smells like all the memory foam I've had in the past.It's just an all around totally awesome topper.You can bet the house, that if this one ever needs to be replaced, I won't hesitate to purchase another one. The company that makes them is great. Super helpful if you have questions. Delivery was quick.All in all, I'm happy with everything and hope this helps others who want to try this latex topper.

TLDR: I truly cannot recommend this enough — and have been recommending it to anyone who will listen.I have interacted with four different latex topper companies in the last two months and have tried three of them, and can say without hesitation that Sleep on Latex is the best in terms of their customer service and the quality of their latex toppers.This summer was Mattress Mayhem for us, starting with a sadly uncomfortable, brand-new, very expensive mattress. I started out trying to fix the problem with a 2” soft Sleep on Latex topper. I’ve had a latex pillow before, but to have it under your whole body is different, like sleeping on cake. It’s cushioning yet supportive, it rebounds quickly so there’s no sinking feeling like memory foam, it doesn’t retain heat, it’s soft enough to relieve pressure, but buoyant enough to actively support concave curves in your body.We realized after a couple of weeks that 2” wasn’t quite enough, as we could still feel the firmness of the new mattress beneath it. We are both lightweight side sleepers (5’7 115lbs & 5’9 140lbs) so it’s easy for mattresses to feel too firm for us — in hindsight I should’ve gotten a 3”, but it’s fine, it kicked off our latex journey :)Weeks of research lead me to believe that Talalay processed latex might be the next best thing to get to stack on top of the Sleep on Latex topper. Sleep on Latex doesn’t make Talalay toppers, just Dunlop, so I had to get one from another company.Note on Talalay vs Dunlop: The best comparison I’ve found is Talalay = angel food cake & Dunlop = pound cake. As the owner of both, the difference isn’t big enough to fret over, IMHO. Talalay is more expensive due to the slightly more complex process, and is a little bouncier/more responsive as a pressure relief layer as a result of having more air bubbles in it, while Dunlop is exceedingly supportive because of its density. Both outclass all other topper materials when it comes to durability, longevity, support, pressure relief, eco-friendliness, value, and utter lack of heat retention, among other things.Anyway, the combination of the 3” Talalay + 2” Dunlop made our bed feel like a big marshmallow. It was amazing. However, I was waking up really sore in my hips from them partially dislocating in my sleep (I have the connective tissue disorder EDS), and ultimately found that the soft & fancy mattress at the bottom was failing to provide sufficient support.I went looking for a less-expensive, still-nice mattress with reputable pocketed coils to use as our base/support layer. The best one we found that met our requirements was literally one fifth of the price of the other mattress (which has since been returned), and the firmness of it unexpectedly & perfectly compliments the latex’s softness, providing the support that a very soft mattress could not, but it still felt ever so slightly too firm.I reached out to Sleep on Latex again with about 100 questions. Among many very helpful insights, they suggested folding our 2” in half under the Talalay to see if that felt better. It absolutely did, so I ordered another 2” soft (practically giddy to feed my newfound addiction to latex bedding, lol).We are (finally) sleeping more comfortably than we have in literal years on top of a whopping 7” of latex on top of an inexpensive-yet-reputable firm 8” pocketed coil mattress.Note on layering: if you’re going all-in on latex like we did but still want the bounce & breathability of coils, make sure the mattress at the bottom is on the firm side (or if you can afford a no-return policy, just get straight pocketed coils for a full DIY mattress). **You can always make a firm bed softer, but you can never firm up a soft bed — plush mattresses are literally just the firm equivalent of that mattress with additional foam on top.** I’d personally much rather be able to control the type and feel of the comfort layer(s) than have it permanently stitched onto a bed that might not work for me. And because it’s modular, single layers can be replaced as needed rather than having to get rid of the whole thing, so it’s more eco-conscious and will last longer. When I figured this out, it felt like I’d cracked the code/cheated the system. Worth it.Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Sleep on Latex also sells the BEST cotton stretch topper covers on the market. It’s really worth getting one if you want your latex topper to last as long as possible. If you order directly from their website, they’re available in every increment from 1”-12”, so one could contain a whole DIY mattress inside a single cover. The top and bottom unzip so the top half can be machine washed, it’s surprisingly easy to put on, makes it way easier to move the latex around without risking a rip, the cotton twill bottom does not slip around (even with our adjustable bed base), and it doesn’t change the feel of the latex at ALL. Per the reps at SoL, it is not designed to protect the topper form liquid, so if you need something waterproof, invest in a TPU mattress protector. It will change the texture of the latex a little, which shouldn’t be bothersome unless you’re super texturally-sensitive (if you are, but still need a waterproof protector, it feels less weird to layer it underneath the cotton stretch cover).Enjoy totally changing the way you sleep for the better :)

Update 6/30/2023: As you can read below in my initial review, the zipper came off the cotton cover after washing. So I ordered a replacement (it's $85 + tax for 2" king) and mentioned in my order that this was to replace a cover where the zipper had come off. Within 30m, I got an email from CS, reversing the charges and sending out via 2 day fedex that same morning a replacement for free because they said that the zipper shouldn't have come off and that it's not fair to have the customer pay for something that wasn't their fault. I was really impressed they did that without me even asking. Furthermore, the replacement cover is better than the one that came pre-attached when I ordered on Amazon: the zipper, on both the top and bottom parts, is a totally normal zipper, like what's at the bottom of your jacket. The original cover I can't really describe how the zipper tracks worked, but they were confusing and were easier to accidentally have the zipper come off. Well, maybe if you're a luddite like me that struggles even with putting on a duvet cover.5 stars for comfort (2" king size soft model). I'm a side sleeper and normally my hip gets sore when I sleep. I've used this for a few weeks now: not a single mote of pain. Same for sleeping on my back. So it gets perfect marks for sleep quality. Furthermore, I did not notice ANY latex scent like some people here seem to claim. Maybe it's because I bought it with the cover already attached? Regardless, at one point I spilled red wine on the cover so I figured I'd wash it. Big mistake. While yes, you can wash it, the zipper easily came off and I spent literally 4 hours trying to figure out how to just simply reattach it. Total waste. So now I have to separately order a replacement cotton topper ($85), wait for that to arrive, then attempt to attach it. You can't buy the cotton topper alone on Amazon: you can only separately buy it direct from the manufacturer, FYI.So tl;dr - 5 stars for everything but cleaning. The zipper is way too easy to accidentally come off and then it becomes impossible as far as I can tell to reattach it. So 1 star for that. But it's still functional, doesn't smell, fixes all my sleep discomfort issues, so I'll just deduct 1 star from the original 5 star review.FYI - If you get a really bad stain like I did, a good way to clean it safely is:1. Use either coarse kosher salt or baking soda and take a toothbrush and scrub a good amount on BOTH sides of the stain2. after that's done, dump the salt, and then pour on some more salt/soda directly on the stain and let it sit for (YMMV) at least an hour, enough time to soak up as much as it can.3. Dump the salt/soda4. Take a toothbrush, and mix a small dab of dish detergent (for hand washing, not your dishwasher), and the hottest water you got.5. Scrub until your arm is sore BOTH sides, using circular motions as well as back/forth6. Use the hottest water you got in your shower to rinse that off7. Take hydrogen peroxide - it's safe (it's actually the main ingredient in bleach-less "bleach" aka color safe and safe for clothing in general) and pour it all over the stain. Repeat the same Cinderella-style tasks of scrubbing til your arm hurts with another toothbrush.8. By now you should definitely be seeing an improvement. When you think it's pretty good, like not anywhere near as much left, once again rinse it all off with your hottest shower water9. Soak the stained part in white vinegar (safe for cleaning pretty much anything) if you have a particularly tough stain like I did, for a few hours.10. Rinse with hot water.11. The stain should be gone, or if not, nearly gone.12. Wash it in your machine: if you have a HE model, pour about 1/4 cup of white vinegar into the fabric softener tray (yes, fabric softener) and just for good measure another 1/4 cup directly into the bottom of the drum and then toss the cover in the machine.13. Wash on warm - I couldn't find a garment tag so I don't know what the hottest it can take is, but I chose the lowest temp above cold14. If, like me, you're super paranoid, when done do another wash cycle but this time use the "color safe bleach" aka plain old hydrogen peroxide: add that to the normal bleach area and, at least with the Clorox brand I got, it said to also add some directly to the HE soap container.15. Both times I washed it, I also did a prewash with a small amount of standard detergent, and both times I did extra rinses to be sure everything was washed away.16. Again, couldn't find a garment tag, but given it's pre-shrunk, I dried it at the lowest temperature (I have a super low setting, even lower than "low" and just above "air dry" on my LG) for an hour and it was all dried and cleaned.17. BE CAREFUL OF THE ZIPPER - MINE EASILY FELL OFF, probably due to negligence (I have a hard time putting duvet covers on as well as doing stuff like this).

We were going to return this topper.  It was soft and we thought we ordered a firm.  My son said he liked it so we kept it.  Now we wish we had returned.  It's too soft just like I thought and a bit flimsy.  It's a topper, not a mattress, so I guess that's okay.  However, I checked back to 2015 and realized I had ordered two Latex mattress toppers.  I like these much better.  Better quality, more substantial.  These were called "100% Natural Latex," and the brand is "Ultimate Sleep."  In my opinion, this is a much better item.  I don't recommend the Pure Green, but I do recommend the 100% Natural Latex.  I ordered a Pure Green Organic Latex Mattress and now I'm hoping it's a good one.  I do "really" like the Sleep on Latex Mattress Topper Cover.  The quality is amazing.  I got a 3-inch to go over a 2-inch topper.  Way easier to install.

I had high hopes after reading the reviews and looking around and doing a lot of research. I got the 2 inch Topper with the cover on it and if it feels comfortable and I will wake up several times during the night with a lower back ache and in the morning it's almost impossible to get out of bed sometimes. I work at a restaurant so I do a lot of manual labor but not enough manual labor have back pains like I do I feel like in the morning, my back pains have been worse than when I just slept without the pad. I'm going to try to get it another try but what is in my cats loving it it has done nothing for my back pain. And it was expensive so I expected a little more out of it. I even contacted the rep and explain my situation and how I sleep, he recommend this.

I do love the support and feel.. however.. this is a strong medium.. not soft.  If you want to sleep on a cloud, this is not it.  however, if you do want to sleep well with support, it will do the job.  I have very firm and expensive (2k+) beauty rest and this helps a lot.  Instead of a rock, its more like a soft compacted sand....

Soft is soft, this is soft! A knee or elbow goes right through...much too easily

I don't like the current mattress, too firm.  I thought I would try the topper. It is a king size bed so pricey with the cover. I don't like the smell reviews on other toppers so went with latex. It has some give but not a lot.  I thought it would relieve hip  pressure but not so lucky. Is it more comfortable, a bit, worth the price no.  And returning is impossible from my understanding so I won't do it again. Just buy the new mattress.

PROFirmer than memory foam, making it easier to get out of bed.CONCauses back ache.Not sleeping any better - yet.  Time will tell.Smells of rubber.  I aired it out for 48 hours.  I sprayed it with Febreze for 4 days.  It still smells when I am in bed.  Car tire smell is difficult to get rid of.Price seems out of wack for a sheet of “latex” with 250 holes in it.  Value = 358 Yuan.  Not 1.0 Yaun more.  (But then how is the seller going to make $1 billion in profit this month?)I will update this review if I end up sending it back before the 30 days are up.  (It is a struggle to send something back to Amazon that is now 20 times bigger than the box it came in!)UPDATED:The seller provided EXCELLENT customer service!My purchase price was refunded.I did not have to pay the $7.99 UPS fee Amazon would have required from this disabled person.

This was not for me, but I am giving three stars because I think it is so dependent on preference. The topper itself seems heavy and high quality, it was just too soft for my needs and caused me alignment problems and pain in my back, much like my old pillowtop mattress (I would say this is just as soft as a pillowtop IMO). I am 5' 6" and 130 pounds and I felt like I mostly sunk in and didn't have the support I needed, though it was not a quicksand type of sinking like memory foam. I think if you enjoy a very soft feel that surrounds you, you may like this product, however I would probably get a 3"in that case because the 2" I had sunk me down pretty far into the mattress. All of this is coming from someone who has a bed with a medium firm latex top layer, and now that I have adapted to that I think the soft was simply not supportive enough for me. I returned this product and the process was fairly easy as far as dealing with the company. They were prompt in giving me an RMA number and refunding my money. Getting the topper itself back into a box was a whole other story! They did offer to exchange the product instead but I declined because exchanges or refunds are limited to 1 per year and after all of the hassle of getting this product shipped and the uncertainty of whether I would like the firmer version I decided to just skip a topper for now. I may decide to give the medium a try in the future if my current bed starts to become uncomfortable though, because I did feel the product was well made. I thought this was a good deal with shipping included, just be aware that a king is going to cost you at least $40 to return, if not more if you don't like it. I recommend talking very in depth with the company for recommendations on which topper would best suit your needs :)

So first off, it arrived to Canada FAST! I ordered on a Friday and it showed up that next Tuesday. It is exactly 2".However, I called Sleep On Latex prior to ordering to explain to him what I needed out of a topper. I said I need support as well as pressure point relief as I'm a side sleeper who has scoliosis, and many subluxations of the spine and loss of curve in my neck. I'm in a ton of pain everyday and night so I NEED something that is supportive enough so I don't sink down INTO the topper. I need to sleep ON the topper. I was initially going to purchase the Medium Firm 2" but he insisted that the 2" Soft is what i need and said that even the Soft is still pretty firm.... Well..... I just recieved it today, put it on the bed and trust me the Soft is VERY SOFT! I can pinch the topper inbetween my index and thumb and feel my fingers touch each other. Very soft. I was really really hoping that it was going to be firmer like he said it would be. 😢 My hip area while laying on my side still dips down too much for my liking. I think, since returning it from here in Toronto would be too much of a hassle, I'm going to keep it, and wait until I can afford to get the medium firm one.Oh yeah, about the smell. It does have an odor that kind of reminds me of baby formula lol which is odd but it's NOTHING over powering like I've smelled from toxic polyurethane toppers. Hopefully the smell will dissipate in time.I'm not sure if it sleeps hot yet as I haven't slept on it. I just really wish I had of gotten the medium firm. Oh well.. U live u learn I guess.

Purchased the 2" topper to make brand new medium firm mattress softer. Aa a side sleeper this does not provide enough pressure point relief. Will ve returning since hips and shpylders are in pain and sleep compromised. Seems fine quality and appreciate it being non toxic but it's springy material without being soft to sink into.

This product gets 3 stars as an average from my wife (1 star) and myself (5 stars).First, 5  stars from me.  This is was the best night's sleep I've had in a long time.  I have intermittent sciatica and am sensitive to pressure points and this topper was great.  It solved all the problems I had with memory foam but kept the memory foam positives.  I liked the plushness that had a springy supportiveness to it, unlike a memory foam topper, which, for me, had the plushness but would ooze out of the way and leave me with pressure points from the mattress below and also slept hotter.  I am a back and side sleeper, 180lbs.Now my wife.  1 star.  She hated this topper.  She said it was like sleeping on an air mattress.  It sprang back too much for her and seemed to be pushing her out of position.  She admitted that it didn't have the motion transfer problems of an air mattress.  But she disliked exactly what I liked about the topper.  Perhaps it is because she is lighter (120lbs), and thus the 2 inch was too much for her.  My experience was completely opposite.I am going to return the 2 inch soft and get a 1 inch soft and see if that suites both of us.  If not, I will get a 2 inch soft twin just for my side.

I'm 5'6" 120lbs, mid-30s, side sleeper and used this for a week. I had high hopes for this topper (3", queen, "soft"). The feel is soft to the touch, but with a consistency/bounce similar to very firm Jell-o. We let it expand for 24 hours, although it seemed to take shape quickly, and aired it out for a day in a room with windows open and fans running.While somewhat soft feeling, the pad doesn't really "give" in the way a foam pad does. I'd say its better for pressure points - which irritate bursitis for me - than soft foam. However, something about the latex feels much firmer than I expected in the way it holds you. I've been waking up with shoulder pain and sciatica down my legs while side sleeping. I don't feel this is any cooler than my previous 3" memory foam pad.Of note, the smell is not initially overwhelming, but it truly lingers and is a bit choking. Same latex smell as putting on latex gloves, or opening a condom wrapper? When my face is close to it at night, it is pretty irritating and seems to stick on my skin when I leave the bed. This is with just a fitted sheet. You will want to budget for a mattress cover, although I don't know if that will remove the smell completely.Overall, the sensation this latex topper gives is interesting and different from foam, but I am disappointed given the price and reviews. Perhaps heavier folks/non-side sleepers will be more satisfied.

After ordering a mattress that to me felt comfortable in store but when delivered it was incredibly uncomfortable, I searched and searched for a topper as opposed to returning the mattress and getting a new one. After a ton of research I settled on this one as I typically don’t like the feel of memory foam and thought latex would be better for me. I especially liked that this gave three options - soft, medium, and firm. I chose soft as I’m a side sleeper and needed pressure relief. The topper came in a timely manner and it was relatively easy to unpack it, it definitely had a smell like latex of course but it wasn’t intense at all and went away once it was in the mattress protector. I unrolled it, shoved it and the mattress into my mattress protector and eventually went to sleep. Unfortunately it isn’t nearly as soft as I’d hoped it would be. To me, it’s relatively uncomfortable. It gives me no pressure relief and I continuously wake up each morning with a sore back. I contemplated returning it but couldn’t fathom how on earth I would get it back in a box now that it’s fully inflated, so I’m just keeping it on my bed for now and will potentially sell it. I would recommend this for the timeliness and the ease of putting it on the mattress plus the fact that the smell really isn’t bad at all, if you’re looking for something soft though, I would not recommend this. I would say it’s more of a medium or firm firmness than anywhere near being soft.

I have had this pad for some time now , and it being chemical free is awesome ! But we had to move it to the spare room bed because even after months the smell is still so over powering ! Comfort is great but not sure what else to do to rid of smell .

For five months the topper worked like a dream. And then my back started hurting.  Topper is no longer flat.  Impression where I sleep

Product needs constant re adjusting

I like to sleep on my side, and I need a soft, cushy mattress top for my shoulder to sink into.  I would rate this latex mattress topper closer to medium rather than soft.  Maybe latex just does not get soft enough.  I even tried folding my topper over to make it 4" thick, and it was just too firm and springy to be really soft and for my shoulder to sink in comfortably.  I am 6'2", 180 lbs., so I do not have a whole lot of natural padding.  This might feel softer for someone my height who is over 200 lbs.Aside from being too firm for me, the quality of this topper is good.  It felt good when lying on my back and it did make the bed much softer than it was originally.  The latex had a sweet milky smell for the first week or two, but it faded away after that.  Interestingly, the latex can generate a lot of static when you move it around.My main bed has a plush hybrid mattress, and its memory foam is softer than this latex topper.  I am trying to create a guest bed that is nearly as comfortable without buying an expensive mattress.  I am going to try a plush memory foam topper to see if I can achieve a softer feel.  I know low density memory foam will not last as long as latex, but it is not that expensive to just replace the topper every couple of years rather than replacing the whole mattress.

This mattress topper is bigger than my mattress. Its "too-big" size is one of the reasons the cover does not fit.

King-2inches. The directions on choosing were very accurate. Added a lot more comfort to the mattress. A little on the firm side, but no more lumps and bumps. Unfortunately, it’s rather hot. I live in MN and we sleep with windows open so very chilly. We roasted despite the cold in the room. Looked at my husband in the middle of the night and he had no covers on at all. It was about 50 in the room. I deliberately chose the latex over the memory foam because latex doesn’t envelope you when you lay on it. If you’re always cold, you may like it.  Probably shouldn’t write this, but for the $200 price I paid, I decided I could go to _______ and get two feather down comforters and get the feel I’m looking for, no hot sleeping, and way cheaper than buying a feather down mattress topper. Wanted to love this, but nope. Sleeping very well now.

When we first bought this mattress topper, it was like sleep magic had been delivered to our doorstep. My husband likes a firm bed; I like a softer bed. (Let's be honest, I'm basically the princess from "The Princess and the Pea".) This topper satisfied us both! Firm enough for the support he wanted, but just soft enough with a lovely bounce that it made my sleep blissful.Alas, if only this fairytale mattress topper had a happily ever after, but 'twas not to be. Over time, this mattress topper slowly became less than perfect, and my joints and pressure points started to feel the pain again. And worse, I just found mold growing in it. Isn't latex supposed to be mold/mildew resistant? Maybe this topper was defective, or maybe my environment is so humid as to defy would-be-antimicrobial characteristics. Suffice it to say I'm a bit disappointed in my almost-fairytale mattress topper.

It is good quality but not soft - I ordered a King-soft and it is mildly soft.  Did not really help me get better sleep because I needed/wanted something that was actually softer.

The product arrived well packaged with no damage. I had no issues getting the topper on my mattress. The 2” topper was an actual 2” unlock some other advertised products. I was excited to sleep on the mattress and over the last month I can give my honest opinion of the topper.Pros- Doesn’t sink in- Doesn’t lose support or cushioning effect over time- Relieves some pressure points and provides some additional softness vs our firm mattressCons- Sleeps very hot! The first couple of nights were excruciating hot. We have our topper/mattress covered tight a cotton mattress cover and fitted sheet and it was still unbearably hot.  I’ve adjusted a bit over the last month but I’m still uncomfortable. The only way to me this bearable would be to buy an expensive wool mattress topper to go over this latex mattress topper.- Latex smell. The smell is strong and very noticeable. As I stated above ours is covered and you can definitely still smell the latex. It better than memory foam but if you don’t like the smell of latex then you won’t be happy because it doesn’t go away. Another downside to this, is that you will end of smelling like latex as well after sleeping on the topper.Overall the cons outweighs the benefits in my opinion, so I can’t recommend this topper.

I think it’s a very personal thing.  Wasn’t comfortable for me.  I returned it.  The return process is awful.  30 days for a refund.  Craziest thing I’ve ever heard.  I shipped it a week and a half ago.  This is how business goes:  quick to take your money and give you a product; slow as a snail to return the money.

First, the good.  We purchased the two-inch version, it's extremely comfy.  Now, the not-so-good.  We have been airing this out for almost three weeks and it still has a chemical odor.  It has dissipated but it is still noticeable.  Every day I pull back the fitted sheet and mattress cover and let it air out through the day.  We live in a very dry climate, which usually helps odors dissipate but we are still having issues.  The sheets and mattress cover also smell of chemicals from the topper.  Finally, it has quite a few pits.  It doesn't impact the comfort but I thought I should point it out in case someone was expecting a perfect piece of latex.  If you have a sensitive nose, I'd pass on this one.

Update: This is on a guest bed and seems to be holding up okay. I put a nice, thick mattress pad over it to hold in place. No further damage noted. Changing from 1 to 3.5 stars.Original Review: First off, I'm a long time latex mattress and/or topper user. I've bought latex toppers from a variety of vendors of different price points, softness, and features but never one like this.Pros: Came well packaged, arrived quicklyCons: The pictures tell the story. This topper is soft-- not as in soft-and-comfortable, but as in falling-apart-in your-hand. The chunk from the first photo came out as the topper was removed from the plastic. It literally sheared off and plopped on the floor. If you look at the second photo the holes from the manufacturing process are crooked, uneven, and/or missing in places. Also, there are air holes all over that have nothing to do with the ventilation as in picture 3.Maybe this is a manufacturing defect and only applies to this particular topper? Don't know but I doubt seriously this is going to last long. Trying to get this back in the packaging, and sending this back may not be possible. Really disappointed about this purchase . If it turns out that these issues are only cosmetic and it holds up, I'll come back and change the rating.

I give customer service 5 stars because I was able to ship it back using Kohls and got a refund. Of course I had to schlep it back into my car and drag it into the store.  There was no way I could stuff it back in the box otherwise.  This mattress pad smelled really bad even after a week of airing out. My sheets smelled even after I washed them.  The latex does what it's supposed to though... give you support while bouncing back vs sinking in. However,  I discovered I like the sinking in feeling of memory foam better. Even the soft latex topper was too hard for me.  I had back pain after sleeping on it for 2 days.  I do not normally have back pain.  But since the company has a good return policy (they will even ship you a return box), I say try it if you're looking for firm support and a cooler surface. I really wanted it to work for me since my T&N foam mattress was so warm.  I heard latex is cooler than foam and memory foam.  It just didn't work for me. Fyi, I'm a very small,  light weight person (105 lbs).  Maybe I don't weigh enough for this type of mattress. I switched back to memory foam even though it runs warmer than latex. But it's still cooler than regular foam.

If I was writing this review just for me, I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to take the path down the middle because my husband didn't like sleeping on the topper.  I have night sweats and I felt the topper really helped with it.  I found it very comfortable and had no problem sleeping.  My husband on the other hand woke up in the mornings with back pain and never felt like he was getting a good night's sleep.  If my husband had of told me he really didn't like it during the time I could have returned it I would have, but he didn't, so it was donated!

For years we had a latex topper as a "comfort layer" on our firm bed.  We loved it but eventually it started to wear out, so we ordered a medium weight 2" topper from Sleep On Latex about a year and a half ago.  Our other topper had been a medium weight, 1 1/2".  The one that came was so hard that eventually I could not sleep on it at all and decided to order the soft, which we cut in half and cut the other one in half so that one side would be a soft topper for me and my husband would keep sleeping on the supposed medium Sleep On Latex topper.  However, the supposedly soft topper is nearly as hard as their medium one, and much harder than our original medium topper from another company.  I understand that technically the Sleep On Latex topper must be a higher quality because there must be more material per square inch in order for it to be harder.  That is little consolation however if I can't get any rest on it.  So now, hundreds of dollars later, we're going to have to get something else entirely.  I gave this 3 stars simply because I understand that this is high quality, not because I can sleep on it.

Took an hour to get it out of the box, it’s wrapped like 3 times. The pad it’s self seems ok.

I am not sure where the buyer on Amazon is getting these? I got one before from Pure Green directly but it was too thick. But this one I got has a much stronger smell that has lasted months and has black specks on one side. They are hard too. I think it could be a second and being sold as though is a normal fully functional one?  I decided to sleep on the non black speck side. But I am a bit concerned about what these could be. I sure hope not bugs. I am thinking maybe some sort of natural plant product. But the one I got directly from the store did not have any of these markings or things on it.The only bonus to getting it on Amazon is the shipping is much faster. That is why I tried it this way this time.It has a plastic latex smell that is more so in warm weather or when heater is on. Seems it should have gone away or not been here at all. I have a latex mattress that never had any smell and tried out a few other latex mattresses and they did not have any odor either.Maybe if one uses a cover for it that would solve that problem but then you would not feel the latex enough.

(2 inch soft) I really wanted to keep this, but the odor was a dealbreaker. I aired it out for several days in a room with a window open and the door closed and it stank up the room and any fabric it touched. A sweet rubbery smell--not quite like tires. I used it anyway, hoping multiple layers of memory foam and mattress pad would help, but I started getting bad headaches. Kohls made it fairly easy to return--I didn't have to stuff it back in the box. OTHER NOTES: The topper didn't make my ultra firm mattress more bearable, but it did improve my basic old sleep number bed. As a result, I think this is better for giving new life to a broken-down mattress rather than lessening the firmness of a mattress. As others noted, the softest topper is still firm. I used an egg crate topper and a thick mattress pad on top to alleviate pressure points. The topper attracts hair like a magnet; had to use a lint roller to get all my hair off. I'm an average sized woman of average strength and I was able to manage this by myself. Opening the box on the bed and unrolling it on the bed helped a lot. It's more unwieldy than heavy.

This has made my old mattress significantly more comfortable.  I love the softness and bounce.Unfortunately it exudes a pungent, gross odor that has never gone away.  Even with a waterproof mattress cover, it makes my sheets stink after two or three days.I aired it out indoors for about a week before putting it on the bed.  The smell is as strong as it ever was, months after purchase.

This helped my situation a tiny bit, but I probably should have gone with the 2" version of it.

We bought the 3" soft version of this latex topper. For the first 6 months it was super. 6 months later it has compressed and you can see that there is a deep area where my wife and I sleep with a big "hump" between us. The neck and shoulder pain has returned.  I'm pretty heavy  but the "dips" are in both sides of the bed. We tried flipping it and that didn't work. We tried spinning it so the foot was at the head and that didn't work. We are thinking that we ordered the wrong firmness but this topper was so nice for 6 months. Replacing it every 6 months can get quite expensive.

Back story. I had a 4 year old pillow top mattress that started to sag. Started getting back pain and I knew I needed a former matteress and never a pillow top again.Bought a firm Simmons and soon found it to be too hard. I read alot and settled on this after a few days reading.  It shipped quick and was well packaged. I began sleeping in it the day it arrived a week ago. My back pain went away when I got this and I sleep like a dream until the alarm goes off.  It has a hint of a latex smell, bit not bad. After all it is latex. It is not obnoxious and I am the one who is usually sensitive to smells......After a year I started getting back pain again.  I took off the sheets and found the latex topper had an impression of my body. Its not supposed to do that, but it does. Buyer beware. These things work great for a while, but they do fail at about a year. Also price doubled in last year so not economical to replace them.

I have slept on latex mattresses or pads for a good portion of my life. This one appears to be well made, but it is not soft. In fact it is surprisingly hard. Obviously comfort is subjective but my old foam 2" topper was more comfortable. The problem is how do you return it? It was compressed and wrapped to fit in the box and there is no way it will fit now. I really expected a pad that had more soft cushioning for my night time pain.

Dang it, I really like the feel of it, but why do they have to lie and tell you it is cooling!! It gets hot just like all of the rest of the toppers.

They are soft and supportive. I suggest If you are ordering more than 1 order them at the same time. I have a split king adjustable bed. So I needed 2 twin xl toppers. I ordered 1 to see if I liked it and it was perfect. Soft and supportive. I ordered the 2nd one and had to sent it back because it was a little thicker and not as soft as the 1st one. The holes that were in the topper did not perforate all the way through. I think that caused it to be a little firmer than the first. Custom services says the holes aren't supposed to all the way through. My husband really loved the 1st one so after I returned the 2nd one. I bought a 3rd one. It was much better than the 2nd one but still not as good as the 1st one.  It is the same thickness as the 1st one unlike the 2nd one and in some spots the holes went all the way through and in other spots they didn't.  Because of their inconsistency I give it 3 stars.

The product has a very good price and is nice and soft, if a little weak and easily torn.  My biggest complaint is the odor!  I had to wrestle with it every so often to turn it over and leave it in my garage for a month to outgas.  Fortunately, it has a plastic cover and I would drag it out into the sun to bake it.  It did not seem to be cured enough when I got it.  I even treated it with an ozone machine.Overall, latex is superb for sleeping and will last for decades with no degradation or memory lumps.  My bed consists of a 4" firm topper, and a 3" medium topper, and finally a 2" soft topper, on my previous bed's platform.  No more sagging springs, chemical fire treatments, allergies, and bug feces-accumulating synthetic conventional bed for me.  Order only 100% organic latex and be careful of additives or synthetics.  Also, get organic cotton and wool bed coverings and you're set for years of healthy sleep!  LATEX ROCKS!

We purchased this 3" latex mattress topper because our mattress (which was soft, as needed for our old bones) had acquired two "gullies" where we lay.  The topper does away with that feeling like we're "in a hole" and is very comfortable, BUT although all king-size beds are standard, this topper is about 4-5" wider than the mattress.  That means we'll have to trim it because right now, it hangs over on both sides which not only makes it harder for the sheets to stay on, but it makes the edge of the bed feel unstable which isn't good when added to the height of the bed.  It's very heavy so unless you're a pretty strong person, you'll need two of you to move it around and get it on top of the bed.  Otherwise, if you like a soft feel to your mattress, this is wonderful.  My hips and shoulders are much happier.

I bought this so my husband would sleep better on our nearly-new queen mattress.  It does help is back, but even though we've had this topper for almost 6 months, I can still smell the latex, even with a mattress pad and sheets over it.  I may be more sensitive to smells than some people, but I regret this purchase every time I smell it.  I wouldn't buy it again for this reason.

It feels nice and the cover is nice, but there are a few small holes in the latex that are not part of the standard hole patterns.  I’m not sure how it will hold up since one hole is in the middle where the mattress pad will get the most wear/tear.  I washed the cover immediately before using it and it says it’s preshrunk but it shrank a lot.  Yes, I followed the washing instructions.  I had to stretch the material with my hands so the mattress pad would lie flat inside the cover.

I have had this topper for about 10 months now. I needed to add some cushion on top of an old memory foam mattress that was rock solid. This mattress pad is very comfortable. My only complaint is that it had a terribly strong latex scent for about 8 months before it faded. Another complaint is that this thing retains heat like nobodys business. It'll be 60 degrees in the room and you are sweating in bed because this thing heats up as if it were a heating bla ket underneath you. I still give it a 4 out of 5 because its just that comfortable. I dont regret buying it as I've had some really good sleep on this thing (especially in the winter). It's just uncomfortably hot in the summer.

I have a Casper I purchased from Costco a couple of years ago.  It's not comfortable anymore.  My plan was to purchase this 2" soft latex topper then eventually purchase a queen Sleep on Latex medium mattress.  Skip ahead and it looks like I'll not be getting the mattress after all due to cost.  The topper was almost immediately helpful with the comfort with the Casper (I'm a side sleeper) but after a few months the back issues I was having are starting to return.  Most likely what I'll do is get a cheaper medium firm 6" or 8" mattress that is fiberglass free and use latex 2" topper as the "comfort" layer.  I 100% would recommend this topper for anyone not wanting to breath in the chemicals from the memory foam or infused toppers.  Out of the box the latex topper had a slight smell but to me it was enjoyable.  It reminded me of my Japanese futon I had many years ago.  Sadly, it went away after a few days.  I purchased just the topper without any cover.  If I had to do it over again I would have purchased the cover, however, the $65 difference in price would be hard to swallow.  I'm still holding out hope that I can get a queen latex mattress but if not this topper should work well with an alternative firmer mattress.

I got the 1 inch version of pure green latex topper, and paid about $150 for it.  In my opinion, it is a good product, but not worth $150......it might be worth more like $40 in my opinion.

I was u sure I'd like a "soft" version of this as I was trying to get away from the sinking feeling of our memory foam topper but I was pleasantly surprised that it was firmer than I was expecting but not as firm as our "Firm" Latex Foam matress. Both my husband and I seem to be adjusting well and are both enjoying better sleep. My sore spots (hips and shoulders) are starting to feel much better, as well. We went with the 2 inch version and I'm glad we did. I'd recommend this if you are trying to finding a good quality topper. Only reason I gave it 4 stars verses 5 was the cost but I guess this is where the saying, "You get what you pay for",  comes from!

We bought a 3 inch soft king size, it arrived 3 days early, very easy to unwrap and place on bed. I didn't buy the cover since I already have a mattress cover with deep pockets that fit just fine. I was in so much shoulder pain, and also frustrated because we had just purchased an organic,spring form,locally handmade mattress from a mom and pop shop because my back was hurting so bad from a once loved memory foam bed that started to sink. Getting a new bed takes a lot of time and research, it's very stressful because you want to get it right. Well as my back was getting better with the new mattress my shoulders started to hurt to the point of sleepless nights. I was so disappointed and frustrated that I bought this very expensive bed of nails,  until I bought this latex mattress topper. What a difference it's making, that 1st night I slept all the way through until morning without shoulder pain. The topper is definitely soft and kinda pillow-ey but thick enough to support my shoulders and whole body, I'm 57 year old woman with some extra weight on me and this topper allows me to sleep through the night. I still have joint pain during the day but this topper has made sleeping easier for 3 months now. If your wondering whether or not to get it, I say go for it. Wishing everyone, everywhere a good night's sleep.

Me and my wife have been using a Nest Bedding Hybrid Latex CalKing mattress for about 4 years.  We also have been using their Alexander Signature 2" memory foam mattress topper.  My wife has become an increasingly hot sleeper and we ended up getting the Eight Sleep water cooling topper last year.  It was terribll uncomfortable when we put it on top of everything so we ended up putting it between the bed and the NestBedding topper and it was able to provide some cooling relief at night for her.Some time after, however, I started having some lower back pain and I began to notice it was worse every morning and I could almost feel it hurting at night due to lack of support from the mushy topper.  When I took the topper off completely the pain slowly went away but then we weren't using the Eight Sleep cooling unit and my wife was miserable.  Because of this we started looking at toppers again and I read a good review on this one and saw that they allowed free returns through Amazon so decided to give the 1" unit a shot.  Specifically because latex is known for being more firm I thought it would contrast with the Nest Bedding topper that was too mushy and give me the support I needed.It arrived quickly and appears to be made very well in general.  However, it was just a little bit too firm.  I didn't hate it but it just felt like it was pushing up on my hip when I was sleeping on my side a little too much.  My wife, who is also a very light sleeper and wakes up at everything ever since we had kids, really noticed that every time I would get in or out of be or move around at all that she felt like she was being jostled around and would wake up.  Noticeably more so than without the topper or with the old squishy one.We decided to try out the 1.5" Serta gel memory foam topper for 1/3rd of the price and were a lot happier overall and decided to return this topper.  The return process was easy (it's a lot easier to repack Latex in the box than memory foam) and they issued the refund right away.  Perhaps a thicker topper would have been a little softer and transfer less motion than the 1" one we tried.  If you're interested in trying a latex topper I think it could be a good option with the easy returns but I'd recommend the 2" or 3" one.  Giving 4 stars for shipping and return process and quality build of the mattress itself.  Loses one star because I personally didn't find the 1" variety comfortable.

It took about 36 hours for the latex to air out and lose the somewhat chemical smell that it came with. I have only slept on it a few nights but I notice a modest improvement in my lower back when I wake up. Less achy. If that continues over the coming days it will be worth the price. Get it with the cover. I only gave it four stars because longevity of usefulness matters and I haven't had enough time to assess that factor.

I previously bought, direct from the company, the same topper for a queen, very firm bed in box type mattress. The 2” soft topper works great as it softens the blow to my shoulders and hips while sleeping. I would not be able to use this bed without this latex topper.  But, this same topper was waaay too soft for my somewhat firm, “regular”, twin mattress. My body sunk into the bed which made me very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I didn't know why there was a difference with the two different size toppers but later realized that my twin bed was softer and more giving than I thought. An additional 2" of a soft topper was just too much cushy-ness. With my spouse, we were ultimately able to get it back in the box that it came in. We initially folded it and put it back in the bag and tried to vacuum the air out. We weren’t t successful , but if we had a spare, large,  packing bag it would have worked.

Added a thick layer between me and mattress,  it wouldn’t stay put. Slid around. Incredibly heavy awkward to move. Felt like it was deteriorating

My husband and I got a new mattress about 2 years ago. It is very firm and as a side sleeper, my husband was having a lot of shoulder pain from sleeping on such a firm mattress. We got this mattress topper and he hasn’t slept better in years!  He loves it. I like it too.  It’s very comfortable. The one thing I don’t like is that I feel every single movement he makes through the night…not a dealbreaker though!

Allergic to the latex odor.  Take a whiff inside a latex glove to compare before purchasing.  Smell stays in your skin.  Very, very heavy.  Told to return in original packaging which is impossible since latex expands as soon as you free the product from machine wrapped plastic.  You'd have to be Houdini to get it back into the original box.  Had to call Amazon to find out how to return.  Had to purchase extra large shipping box Home Depot.  Then pay $12.99 for UPS to pick up since it is so heavy.  As for comfort, added some padding but nothing to write home about.  Make absolutely sure this is what you want before going through the hassle of "free" return.Company explained after product returned that they would have provided the large box and shipped the return for free if contacted directly.  No one told me beforehand and they said they will rectify the situation with Amazon.  Also reimbursed my costs for return.

I actually really liked this mattress topper. Very comfortable, not too thick, no noxious smell, breathable, etc. My problem is that even though I rotate it several times a month, it has developed valleys. Now when I roll over, there's a noticeable change in elevation. Not the end of the world, but disappointing as I liked it so much at first. I've never used a mattress topper before, so maybe this is common, but I can't see buying a new one every year as that's just insanely wasteful. I guess I'll keep looking for something more permanent. This one is still ok for now, but I assume the situation will keep getting worse now that it's started.

I like the fact that this product seems to be helping me reduce the pressure points while sleeping....It seems like it is getting better each day............

I'm so glad I purchased this mattress topper.  At first it seemed a little too soft but I got used to it and my shoulder and hip pain/stiffness has greatly improved  since sleeping on this.  Unlike memory foam, it bounces back which to me is more comfortable.  It gave an old mattress new life.  There is a slight odour when first opened but it dissipates over several days.

3 in. Ordered because it is a natural product.  It is a little harder that I thought it would be.Still love the sleep.Think thinner product would be softer.

A wee bit on the soft side.  Do not wake up with back or hip pains.

I spent a lot of money on what was supposed to be a 'plush' mattress. It felt like sleeping on the floor. The store didn't take returns, so I started looking for a topper. The first one I bought was memory foam, and it was like laying in quick sand. I bought this one in the two inch and have really loved it. It does start to indent where you sleep, but they probably all do. I've had mine for 8 months, and already looking to replace it. I figure I will need a new one every year. I wish the price wasn't so high, but it does give much more comfortable sleeping and less pain. It would get five stars if it lasted longer.

I ordered the “soft” model Vs. Firm.I opened the shipping box and it definitely had a “mild” [to me] odor. After removing it from the box and taking off the shrink wrap, the odor was stronger. From past experiences with foam toppers (regular & latex) it is a less offensive smell when compared to typical non-latex foam toppers and mattresses, which had a pungent chemical / petroleum smell.After 24 hours with an overhead fan above, the majority of off-gassing was over. After moving it onto the mattress, there was a mild odor, but it was definitively tolerable.Last night was our first night’s sleep. We both felt initially that it was firm, however I fell asleep quickly and never woke up until AM. In the morning I was rested and had zero pain from my shoulders, neck and back! Wow! Sleeping through the night is miraculous in itself, but to do so pain-free is next level goodness for me. The shoulder pain, from foam toppers, was at a point it lasted most of the day. I can attest to —> so far, so good!  Four ⭐️ for now, we’ll see in 6 months and a year from now how well it holds up and delivers pain free, uninterrupted sleep.Update 6/6/23. I noticed the mattress has imperfections. I contacted the seller and sent them pics to inquire if it was “normal” or a current or future problem. They made the judgment call to send a replacement topper plus a box and label to return the original. That was exceptional customer service!

This topper is very comfortable. Had no problems with smell.  I am, however, disappointed that it didn't take long for it to get a "sink" impression.  I am flipping it over every month but that doesn't seem to help.  It does, however, improve my sleep comfort

The Drunken Reviewer here giving some more "helpful" advice on your next amazon purchase!OK, so some people rebuild cars, some rebuild motorcycles.  I, on the other hand, rebuilt my bed, literally.. So a few years back the wife and I bought a brand new Vera Wang mattress from a box store at a "great price". It was nice, everyone slept great, for about a year...  Then we tossed and turned as it slowly started to sink in the two spots we normally slept.  Warranty to the rescue!  They come out, they measure the "dents", claim it as bad and tell us to come get another mattress.  But wait, why not just bring us another?  "Oh that one was a special discount price, we can only give you store credit for it..."  Well so much for my great price...  So now I'm stuck with a cheaper one unless I wanted to pay more instore, yay.  This one lasts a few years but eventually failed again and this time we're into the "pro-rated warranty" period.  So do I get an even cheaper mattress from the store?  No.  This time I researched and researched until I'd learned enough to never buy a box store mattress again.  But I also learned why my mattress failed and what was still good in my mattress, the box spring foundation.  And just like in houses, if the foundation is good, you can rebuild anything.So I completely disassembled my old mattress, and bought 3 things.1.  A proper bed frame (also from Amazon)2.  An awesome ticking (it's a mattress term, look it up!) that was zippered and washable3.  This Dunlop based 100% natural 3" Latex Mattress Topper!!So I took apart my mattress and chunked the old ticking and crappy top layer of foam that had died and caused all the problems from the get go.  Then I put the bottom spring foundation into my new ticking, then the still functional piece of foam from the old mattress, then this Awesome piece of Latex!  And you know what!  I was too damned stiff for me...  Now the wife loved it, but just a little too much stiffness for my sleeping taste.  So unzipped the ticking and swapped the foam and latex so that the foam was on top and the latex was in the middle.  BAMM!! Sleepy Awesomeness for All!!!So yes, this drunken fool cut up his mattress and rebuilt it like a 65 Mustang, from the ground up.  And you know what?  That was 3 months ago and we've been sound sleeping ever since.So why the 4 stars?? Because this thing said and I just can't call this anything but medium, maybe medium/soft...  But other then that, it's been very much so an awesome addition to my bed rebuild project.  I just hope they'll make an extra soft 1" version I can use to cover this one once the standard foam I put on top wears out.And why does this thing smell like a Sweet Vanilla Milkshake???

Originally brought as my 9-year old queen mattress topper, did not notice it was "soft", sleep on it for 2 weeks, and initiated a return, while getting the item ready for return... 2 nights without it, realized that it was very helpful for my aches and pains.  Cancelled my return and likely will buy another medium firm version for other beds in the house!  No smells noted, very good quality!

Update 6/3/2023:The seller responded quick and sent me a replacement and no need to return the old. So I will give them a 4 star instead of the 2 star on my previous rating for good customer service. Reasons for not a full 5 stars is due to the prolonging smell. It still smells eventhough it has been aired out, at least 2 weeks now. It has an earthy tree like strong smell. Also, I have the other toppers from the same seller, and they aren't exactly the same length (all full size topper). It's slightly off and not even, but I guess it's ok. Just have to make it work. Overall it feels comfortable.5/21/2023The other toppers came out fine but this one when fully opened has a torn spot. The topper is a 2in with soft comfort. It firmness is soft so it feels very light and flimsy compared to the medium and firm topper. Of course it has an odor which needs to air out. When I try to move it on top of another topper, I feel afraid as I would end up ripping it because it feels cheap? Good thing I bought the other level of firmness or this soft firmness is a no go.

I had an Avocado latex topper that needed to be replaced after 7 years. Avocado topper covers are really nicely made so I just unzipped it and replaced the old  latex with this 3” soft king topper. It is pretty firm in my opinion,I’m a side sleeper. Maybe it will get broken in over time but hoping for a more plush feel from the “soft” option. Instead I was tossing and turning all night trying to get comfortable. I’ll keep using it and see how it breaks in.

Bought to put on our expensive Sleep Number Bed, which no matter how we adjust both of us woke up with varying pains.  Being very sensitive to smells, I was worried bc I had recently purchased a supposedly all natural latex pillow, and altho comfortable, had a bad strong smell.  I learned later that all natural could still mean it had toxic fillers.  First I want to say that this topper is very quality latex, it had a very very slight fresh smell is the way I would describe it, but not at all like the pillow I have.  I honestly think the smell is nice and I am very sensitive.  To protect, we laid a duvet cover we had on top of it,  then placed a sheet on top of that, and putting my head to the topper could not smell anything at all the very first day.  This was very important.  We purchased the 3 inch soft and the feel is nice, tho still a little firm.  So right now my husband is up in the air about whether he wants to get a Talalay which he thinks will be softer.  I feel it is nice, and gives the perfect amount of comfort.  I am a back sleeper and partial side, and find myself sleeping more on my side now.  A couple of aches and pains I was having in my back and neck have improved also.  I am giving 4 stars bc I wish it had come with a cover, and also bc it is hard to handle, very large, heavy, etc.  But I want to say that this is what they say it is, quality latex, no toxins which was very important.  Other places are selling toppers with covers for twice the price.  I even have seen them for 3 times the price so I think this topper is a good deal, and this is reputable place to purchase your latex toppers.  I do want to note that many toppers are made of Talalay tho, not Dunlop like this one, which is used bc it is slightly softer.  This one has a rating of 20 so consider that.  It did make my bed softer though and still gave support.  I also believe that Talalay has a tendency to not be as pure and so that was a worry for me, having had that bad smell experience with the Talalay pillow I bought.

SEE UPDATES AT BOTTOM. I have a latex mattress that had a sagging, poly pillow top, so I decided to cut off the top, and add a new topper. I selected this to serve as the top. I contacted the seller for product advice, and I also contacted a foam mattress production expert I know, and he said that, for the price and quality claims, this is a great deal.They were right! It's perfect! As a side sleeper, I need cushion to prevent the pressure points I had before. I would say this is medium-soft, as it has a lot of elasticity, while still being dense and supportive. I do bottom out a little, though, so I might get the 2" medium for underneath. I weigh 270 pounds, by the way.For centering this on your mattress, I highly recommend a technique that another reviewer suggested- lifting and shaking/fluffing it, like you would a sheet or comforter. It utilizes the bounce and elasticity of the foam, while spreading it out. That was really the only way to get it on the bed right without ripping it into pieces, and also the way I recenter it from shifting. Also, I got a wool mattress pad to replace my waterproof one (which was making me sweat- this thing sleeps HOT), and it has elastic bands that keep my topper in place.  Makes things WAAAAAAAAY easier. If you can, I suggest a pillow top protector that has the elastic bands.UPDATE: five months in, I had a bit of an issue with the topper beginning to sag. I contacted the seller, sent them pics, and they immediately sent me a new one. They stand by their product, and provide excellent customer service! Four stars, would be three, but they get an extra for customer service. We'll see how long this one lasts- latex foam is supposed to last years!*The first replacement they sent was warped at the bottom, from being compressed too long. They immediately sent a second one.

This is an Amazon's Choice product with 4.5 average reviews. So odds are one size or another will work for you.  Some other reviewers have reported that it smells, that theirs was cut wrong, and that it is hot.  Quality control appears to be an issue.  However, my 3 inch queen topper came as advertised (60 x 80).  Two very (very) minor flaws.  I rolled it out on my mattress and it appeared to be fully inflated within minutes.  I gave it a couple of hours, but only because it was lunch time.  There is a mild odor.  However, I put a waterproof covering on it, put an electric mattress pad warmer on top of that, and a padded mattress pad on top of that to keep from feeling the electric wiring in the warmer.  No more odor.  It seems to be helping to reduce/eliminate my morning hip/back pain. My problem, however, isn't spinal, it is in the muscles in my lower back.  Just FYI,  I weigh 205 pounds, and while the two inch might have worked just fine, I'm happy I spent a few extra bucks on the three inch.  It works for me, but with this topper you pay your money and take your chances. Odds are in your favor.  They seem to have a generous return policy, but at 35 pounds, at 76 years of age, and with back problems I'm really glad it worked because there was no way I was going to wrestle it back to the UPS store.  Oh, I turned my mattress warmer off  after sever hours and had to turn it back on later in the night because I was cold.  The topper  didn't soak up my body heat, but then there were several layers of cloth  between me and the latex.

I’m exactly middle of road about this topper, but that’s not to say it isn’t light years better than the memory foam one we had. We bought a tempurpedic Loft king bed, listed as soft, but it felt like a brick to us. We started with a 4in visco foam topper to soften it up. It did, too much. It was like sinking into quicksand, it was hot, there was a smell, and strangely, it felt like you were rolling off the edge of the bed if you weren’t in the center. It was like it cut down the width of our bed by several inches. It was so difficult to move on that I’d find my shoulder going numb during the night because I wasn’t changing positions normally. So we decided to try this one. I noticed it’s more brittle, almost “dry” feeling so I had to be careful when I was moving it because if you pull on it, it WILL TEAR. It’s got some bounce, nothing like memory foam. There’s no sinking in. I don’t get the feeling of sleeping on a cloud. It’s supportive, but not really conforming, more cushioning. It’s not hot to sleep on, works on our adjustable bed, and the smell wasn’t bad and went away as soon as the protector was on. I’d say, if you know you want latex and you know what to expect, this is an excellent value. If you’re not sure what the differences are but want something soft, try to find a store with a latex bed sample to try first. I wouldn’t call this topper soft, but my husband who loves a firm mattress thinks it’s perfect and calls it “a soft medium” so for couples, this is likely a good pick. We will definitely be keeping it, and we’ve noticed improved sleep, no pain, and the bed feels great, but I think to get that plush (but not mush) luxury hotel bed feeling, maybe adding a mattress pad will do it.

Revised after sleeping on it for a few weeks: in the note below I say it doesn't retain heat - but it does.  I had to take it off the bed. It still works really well for reducing overall aches and pains for sure, but I was definitely waking up from being too warm. I would need to adjust bed position to allow it to cool off and had to adjust several times a night.  Too bad because I do think it was comfortable.I bought this about 6 or so months ago. I tried it a few nights and I was too hot so I just stopped using it pretty quickly.  Fast forward to now and I decided to try again because my  back pain and joint pain were getting worse, I thought from now working at home and poor posture. I also recently purchased some Bamboo "cooling" sheets and a similar cover for a weighted blanket that I had also previously stopped using.  (I don't sleep well, I am always in search of how to sleep better).  Much to my surprise, my back and joint pain started improving immediately.  After several days, I now am so much less stiff, its actually amazing which is what made me decide to review as I read reviews for every purchase and appreciate them.  But I'm still hot - just not any more hot than I think using anything else.  I am also using a weighted blanket again.  So if you are considering this for pain then I say give it a go.  If you are a hot sleeper, this is not part of a solution but I don't know that it made anything worse!

Not soft but Very comfortable. I have Fibromyalgia and my old mattress was making me toss and turn. I'd wake up in pain having hardly slept. I researched the heck out of the issue. Went down to a mattress store and tried out hybrid, gel and memory foam mattresses. I read hundreds of comments on every mattress , ALL the brands, as well as help sites for my condition. The most common recommendation was to get a Beautyrest BLACK mattress and then put a 3" latex topper on it. The cost of doing that is rather high. A major investment. Plus there were TONS of complaints on Beautyrest, Simmons and Serta. Seems like everything else these days mattresses are designed to give out after only a few years so you have to buy another one. So, I decided to try this PURE GREEN 100% Natural Latex Topper on my old Thomasville bed first. It works just fine. I'm not buying a $3000 mattress when this pad is all I need! Everyone recommended the "SOFT" version and they are right! I would call this medium-firm myself. You do not sink into Latex. You sleep on top of it and it adapts to your body springing back as you move around. It's easy to move on. I am now not only comfortable but am sleeping a full 6 consecutive hours a night which is phenomenal for me. I got the Sleep Ease cover for it which has a side that is supposed to keep the pad stationery on your mattress. It helps but the topper still gradually slide off the bed. It does make it easier to grab and pull it back on straight. SAn Amazon reviewer recommended putting a RUG pad underneath and that does work. There is NO smell. The quality is good. I got a Queen and it is slightly smaller than my bed. Looks to me like the  latex was just cut off a big roll. My 13" deep fitted sheets still fit. It comes rolled and compressed in a box. I left it out on the living room floor for a few nights to flatten out but am not sure that was really necessary. Recommended.

Pros:SupportivePerfect blend of support and paddingCloud like feel, as you sink in a little, but not longer memory foamCons:Sleeps warm, get a cooling coverLatex smell is prominent, yet has diminished some over the past few daysI’m really glad I bought this as it’s really helped my challenges with my one year old tempur-pedic which has a higher degree of “sink“ in the mid-section/hips which leads to back pain. This has helped a lot as I’m walking up with less pain and feeling more well rested. I’ll update my review once I get the bamboo cover over the later pad.

EDIT: Although the topper didn't work out for us, have to recommend the company's great customer service. They reached out to us immediately and offered their assistance. Wish more companies were as professional and courteous as this! Changing my rating based on their response.Purchased the latex topper about 2 months ago due to back issues with a mattress that is slightly too firm. At first, the topper felt great: a little bit of cushion without being too thin or too soft. But less than 2 months later, it had gullies from where my husband and I slept. Removed the topper and our mattress was as firm as ever without any gullies. Money wasted.

I have a crappy hybrid mattress (sleeps too hot) that I am trying to extend the life of before I'm forced to buy another mattress.  I was hoping to get another year out of what I have now, so I purchased this topper and a wool topper to try to minimize the nightly overheating.  I've got both on my bed now (and also a cooling mattress pad from Sheetz) so hard to say how much of a difference each component has made, but I'm sleeping much better now.  My biggest complaint about this pad (and hence the 4 stars) is that it hangs over the queen mattress too much.  They should've taken off 2" from each side so that it fits on top of the mattress instead of hanging over!  WTH  it's the little things that make something good into something awesome.  I do not think a 2" latex topper would be enough of a difference if you wanted to change the feel of your current mattress.  I don't know the purpose of a 1" at all unless you're a sprite or weigh 10 lbs.  So depending on why you're purchasing, you might want to look at the 3".  If like me, you're just trying to minimize overheating at night the 2" would probably be fine.I have the topper under a mattress pad, on top of which I put the wool topper right under the sheets, so the overhang on the pad just makes the edge of the bed feel weird.  So far, it is working for me along with my other purchases to make my sleep at night much more pleasant.

This has been a Goldilocks experience! We had a memory foam topper for a few hrs but due to neck & back problems it was just too soft. So after much research, we ordered the medium firm topper.  Way too hard! Tried sleeping on it for 2 nights & couldn't do it. Was much too firm. So I returned it & ordered the soft & it's great. This material (latex) is different than memory foam - you don't sink in. Soft isn't really that soft & you don't sink in too much.  They only have soft, medium firm & firm but soft is still fairly firm. Also on both toppers we layed then out in the garage on a sheet x 2 days in case they smelled bad (from others' reviews) but neither did.Now re the return - wow lol. These come in a big box & they are vacuumed sealed. We tried & tried to put it back into the original box but there was no way.  Two grown men + me tried to squish it in there & it just became humorous. So we had to get a huge box (used one that a ventahood came in! Next step was gonna be a refrigerator box!) to send it back. Took up my whole back seat when I lugged it down to UPS. Glad I didn't have to return the 2nd one as Amazon charged us nearly $30 to return this beast!  So hope this helps those of you considering this topper!

I bought the 3" king-size in soft. What I would do different next time - buy 2 twin size long instead of a king. Why? Because there is motion transfer with latex that you don't get with memory foam. It's like laying on gelatin. Someone else said this in their review, and I wasn't sure what to make of it; however, after sleeping on it, I would describe it the same way.Our memory foam pad had met the end of its life - about 3 years. I was having pressure points hurting again. I debated and debated on what to get. What sold me on the latex was its durability. I shouldn't have to replace it every 2-3 years as we do with memory foam toppers.I do find this mattress topper to be comfortable. My hold back from 5 stars is the motion and the fact I can still smell latex. I'm not sure how to stop that. If you aren't sure what latex smells like, it's just like latex balloons or condoms.I have a slightly padded mattress pad on top of the latex topper as a protector more than anything.I'm 5'9 150 lbs. My husband is 5'10" and 190 lbs. He loves it and said it was a big improvement.

The topper softens my firm IKEA mattress a little bit.

Just got it yesterday, we’ll see how it lasts. Seemed pretty comfortable interested on how it will hold up.

Fits my bed nicely, I wanted to try all Natural latex, I thought it would be more of an hugging, sinking into and cooling experience but it's firm, fairly warm and very heavy.  This is a full 2" and probably better in the winter for warmth.

This is the latex pad I should have ordered in the first place. It’s not mega soft but much nicer than the firm I mistakenly ordered. It’s just about right.

I sleep very hot and decided to try latex since memory foam makes me sweat so miserably at night. This topper makes a HUGE difference. No sweating at all and it's comfy. This is definitely worth it for that alone.Their customer service is also amazing, the topper I was originally sent had some manufacturing defects so I emailed the company and they got back to me within an hour and sent me a free replacement. They went above and beyond to help out.

I bought this topper to replace a memory foam for my son's bed.  It list as 75 inches long, but I was shocked at how it didn't come anywhere near close to fitting the mattress.  This one was only 73 inches long and it looked like it had been cut.  Very disappointing, because I was seriously thinking of replacing our king topper with one of these, but my husband would never been able to tolerate his feet hanging off.

We've come a long way in convenient bedding solutions for neat freaks like me that get rid of all my bedroom furniture in anticipation of a move that didn't happen.  Luckily, I was able to borrow an air mattress and as I lay stiffly on its creaking, air-hard surface, I knew I had to do something.  I love latex products.  I've been using this miraculous substance as a pillow for years and years.  So I knew what I was getting into when I purchased this topper.  Queen sized and 3" high, it comes as a completely manageable 35 lb roll that even 5' me can get into my place and rolled out onto the mattress.  It's rough going trying to find a fitted sheet that will cover a mattress, a pad and this topper, but completely necessary for reasonably good sleep.  It's not the same as my old Beautyrest NxG but the thing was toast and had to go.  I will rest easy in latex limbo until I figure out my next living situation.  For $200, it's a worthwhile 4 stars.

I read a lot of reviews from different bed toppers and I opted for this one.  Everyone is different with various issues and in the end you really don’t know what’s best for you until you sleep on it.Here goes my experience. I hope it helps.....It was difficult removing the air tight plastic wrap.  Due to my medical issues my friend took care this and the set up.  Once he removed the wrapping, he placed it in an encased box spring cover (it was all I had).  That was a task and in the process pieces of the topper were coming off.  It appears the topper is slightly larger than my full size bed, but not enough to be a major issue.I ordered the soft, but it wasn’t the soft feel I was expecting but after a nights sleep, I woke up with a lot less pain from the chronic back and neck pain I deal with 24/7.  It provides great support and made a major difference from the hard orthopedic uncomfortable bed I own.  So far, it’s been a lot better than my bed but I would have rather a slightly softer feel and for this reason only I give it 4 stars.FYI: I’ve only had it for a few days

Long story short, I ripped the pillow top off of my plush S-brand mattress and replaced the cheap foam inside with 2 inches of memory foam, one inch of medium firm latex, and one inch of soft latex.I wanted a soft, supportive, breathable surface and this has been the perfect combination for me as a side sleeper. It took a lot of experimentation; I initially opted for a firm & medium firm combo and it truly felt like sleeping on the floor, even with the 2-inch memory foam on top. I gave it a few nights, hoping I'd adjust, but the pain all through my back was unbearable. I initiated a return and Sleep on Latex sent me a large box that could easily accommodate the firm topper. They never mentioned they'd knock $15 off my refund for return shipping so I deducted a star for that reason. Disappointing.However, replacing the firm topper with this soft one really worked out for me. No more back pain, no pressure points, no tossing and turning. Even as someone who loves a soft bed, I think this is best used in combination with the medium firm topper (or a firm mattress) but everyone's preferences will differ.Overall, I recommend this brand and especially recommend the layering approach if you're attempting mattress surgery. You'll appreciate the opportunity to adjust the layers as you figure out what works for you.

We purchased a 2" foam gel infused king topper (with holes to vent air) for our new Prana plush mattress (sleeps like a medium mattress does not envelope encase your body but rather you sleep on top).  The gel foam topper was purchased because we were having shoulder, hip, knee pain from the firmness of the so called "plush" mattress.The gel topper is good but the issue we were having is that when your body heat warms the topper you sink AND your body heat radiates from compressed gel topper back to your body and doesn't allow the heat to escape until you move. Usually repositioning results from pain from compressed topper if not prompted by the warmth.We have a second mattress (latex & foam/springs that was awesome for years now18 yrs old, did cost $3000 at the time ). The 2nd mattress was flipped over (ones they say you cant flip) but it was so bad it was flip it or throw it out.  Bought the 2" Latex topper placed it on the flipped mattress and its about 70% better.  The LATEX topper is COOL and doesn't radiate heat back to your body, bouncier, but was worth not throwing out our 2nd mattress.

It is comfortable and gives me the cushion I was looking for. I've only slept on it one night (with sheet covering it) and the odor was strong and my skin felt hot and itchy. Due to the weight and tackiness of the pad I couldn't pull it into the zip up mattress pad I already had, so I put a 2nd fitted sheet on. Even if you don't think you are allergic to latex I would suggest a) airing it out for a couple days and b) having a  mattress pad or something else in addition to sheet separating you from this pad.

I probably had unrealistic expectations for this mattress topper that it would make our “armless convertible sofa” feel suddenly super luxe for guests to sleep on, and it does not. But it does make a difference in the bed being more comfortable, it’s natural fiber, and it is not hot. So those are all wins. And I would still purchase it again, with more reasonable expectations

I bought the 1 inch topper based on Wirecutter recommendation. It gives just enough cushion for a side sleeper, without adding so much depth that I would need new sheets or be too soft for my back.  I sleep hot and this topper hasn’t changed my sleeping temperature, a significant plus since I can’t tolerate many other types of foam toppers. The only downside was the odor!  I aired it out for a few hours; directions said that longer airing out would make odor worse. I covered it with a good quality mattress pad, and hoped for the best. It’s now a week later and I no longer detect the odor.

This is an excellent product! Bought the three inch and it completely changed the feel of the mattress. Unfortunately, we both didn't like it and the customer service for the return was Five Star+

I bought a gel memory foam last year. While it feels good to lay on it at first, it gets miserable after a while as it does traps body heat even though it has a gel in it 🥵 and makes it difficult to change the position since it has a slow response. I do have an expensive good quality mattress, I just wanted to add a layer of comfort. I love this topper!!! It's soft, and yet, it supports you unlike memory foam.  Aging sucks! Every part of my body is very thankful for how this topper makes them feel better. I will never return to a memory foam, gel or no gel. Delivery was fast. As far as smell: I have a very sensitive nose. If I would have to rate it on a scale 1-10(10 is the worst) I would give it a 3. It didn't bother me much.  I did put a luxurious mattress pad over it and I can't smell it. We bought 2 inch king size ( soft). I will definitely buy from this company again. I am 47 year old female that unpacked the package and put it on the bed by myself  without any help. I did it carefully by folding it and unfolding it. It's not too heavy. Anyway,  thank you so much for a great product.

I’ve been piecing together my perfect sleep setup for years. A few years ago I invested in a nice mattress with adjustable bed frame— but it was still too firm. For the past few months, I’ve been researching how to improve without starting over. This mattress topper is the answer! I spent hours reading reviews and (after a few regrets and returns with other brands), I committed to the 3” queen foam topper and it’s perfect! I finally have the soft cozy bed of my dreams with less joint pain, and I didn’t have to buy a whole new bed frame and mattress. This brand seems to focus less on marketing gimmicks and more on just producing a quality, affordable topper. I can’t speak to the longevity since I’m only about a week in, but every other box is checked. If you’ve just about given up on the perfect soft/plush bedding, this is the one!

We bought a firm mattress by mistake. Needed to fix the problem and we went for the medium firm option. Unfortunately, it was too firm for either side sleeper or back sleeper. The company was excellent with its customer service. They provided us with a bigger box to return the mattress topper in a timely fashion! We ended up getting the soft 3in topper. Absolutely just right! Unlike the memory foam toppers, the latex material is awesome as it will not make you feel like you are sinking or make you feel hot.

Had bought a Purple Mattress Plus and it is very comfortable but a little too firm for me as am a side sleeper.  Should have bought the regular Purple Mattress(not the Plus) as it is softer.  Too many days had passed for a return so was going to give the Plus away and buy the regular Purple but saw these latex toppers and decided to give it a try.  I weight about 250 lbs. and was thinking the soft might be too soft so I called the company and a customer service rep said the soft is not really too soft so I ordered the 3" soft.It arrived and it did not have any kind of an odor that I could detect.  Slept on it that night and it was perfect.....just the right amount of softness.  I think the medium would have been too firm so I would recommend the soft to side sleepers unless your mattress is really sagging then maybe the medium or the firm.  Have been sleeping so much better since added this topper and am very happy with it.

I have a five-year-old medium firm latex mattress and had been waking up with numbness from pressure points. I put the soft 3-inch topper on it and now I'm reluctant to ever get out of bed again. So cushy, but unlike memory foam, retains its shape without retaining heat. And, to my relief, my sheets still fit despite the increase in height. Easily the best purchase I'll make/have made all year.

This is just exactly what we wanted.  The 2" soft pad over an extra firm mattress is excellent for side sleeping.  It alleviates the joint discomfort occasionally caused by the extra firm mattress, but still allows one to sleep on top of the mattress rather than "in" it.  The 2" queen pad fits perfectly to the queen mattress.  While there was no odor upon opening, we did let sit inhouse for 24 hours before placing on the mattress.

I took a chance ordering the Pure Green Natural Latex Mattress Topper because I was not confident that it would work for me...I was definitely ecstatic with the results!  These last few nights have been the best sleep I've had in years!  I ordered the 2 inch topper instead of the 3 inch because the 3 inch was just too much money for me, but am thrilled that the 2 inch works great!  You won't go wrong ordering this product, I promise!!

I have given this topper a few months before reviewing.First, I went to this from a memory foam topper, which was also 3 inches. My memory foam was not very old, but it was SO HOT, like wake up sweating buckets in the middle of winter hot, and the nature of sinking into it made me constantly sink into my husband's valley, thus giving me a horrible back ache. I was not waking up rested at all, and something needed to give.We needed something to cushion our less than a year old futon mattress, as it is so hard and stiff that it makes my arms fall asleep and gives hip pain. A new mattress was out. Can't afford one, and don't want anything else memory foam Ever. Again.I tried a feather bed, which was glorious for all of 2 months, until it developed a permanent "dent" where our rear ends rested nightly. And this happened despite my daily fluffing to redistribute feathers. So feather beds were out, too!So I looked at other natural alternatives. Latex is something I have been interested in for years, but it is so expensive! We decided a good night's sleep was worth the cost, plus this company had a good return policy.This latex topper took a little getting used to, since we have been on memory foam on and off for years. I loved it immediately. You don't sink in, so you don't feel trapped, and it does not sleep hot at all!It took my husband a few weeks before he could say he really likes it.I do not bottom out on this, but my husband does, so he still feels the mattress underneath around his hip area. For reference, we got the soft topper in 3 inches. I vary from 110lbs to 115lbs. My husband is around 140lbs. He still feels we need another 3 inch topper in medium to go under the soft for him to be 100% comfy.Also for reference, my husband is a 100% side sleeper, and I switch from side to back about 50/50.So if you are heavier than 130lbs and sleep exclusively on your side, you may want to go with a medium firmness, or put a soft on top of a medium if you have an unbearably hard bed like we do.This latex topper gives nice "bounce" for amorous activities. You don't get the annoying sinkage like with memory foam, so that is a nice plus!I definitely recommend this latex topper for anyone who doesn't want the hot mess and chemicals of memory foam, or the maintenance of feather beds, but who wants to soften up their current bed.A couple things I noticed:1) It does have an odor. It isn't terrible, but the smell clings to my sheets. It doesn't give me a headache, and I don't notice it anymore unless changing out sheets.  So I do feel the smell is natural, since it doesn't make me feel ill like memory foam smells do. Some reviewers say it smells like vanilla pudding. Not sure what type of pudding they eat... but it definitely doesn't smell like any kind of pudding I have ever had, vanilla or otherwise!I don't know if a cover would diminish or eliminate the smell. Haven't tried one.2) This will take on the shape of the mattress or surface you put it on. If your current mattress has sizeable divots in it, this topper will mold to those.3) To get the most benefit from the softness and bounciness of this topper, do NOT make your bed super tight. For example:  I like my bottom sheet to be nice and tightly stretched onto the bed, complete with hospital corners (on my side, anyway, as my husband hates his side of the top sheet tucked in.) You can't do this with this topper. I noticed tight bottom sheets equal a firm, stiff topper that doesn't have any softness or bounce, and my arms go numb when laying on my side. Make your bottom sheet fit loosely, and don't compress the topper, and it will work as it should.4) Cats don't like the feel of this topper on their paws when you have stripped the bed and are remaking it. Seriously. They act like they have tape on their paws or have stepped in water. Just sayin'.I would buy this again in a heartbeat! We are talking about getting 2 more 3 inch toppers in medium firmness to make our own mattress, as this is what other latex mattress companies do to make their soft mattresses: 3" soft, 3" medium, 3" medium. Sleep on Latex offers a custom cover if you want to stack your covers, so that's what we will be doing in the next year or so.Happy Sleeping!!**I purchased this with my own money and have received absolutely NO compensation for my review. I rely on reviews from real people to make purchases, and thus, when I find a product I like, I review it, on my own time.**

It's only been 2 nights but I really only needed one night to know. Let me start off by saying I don't write of lot of reviews but I felt the need to write this review so that someone that might be in my predicament might have an honest review to go off of when purchasing this mattress topper. 2 weeks ago I bought a mattress off of Amazon that happened to be  great as far as hitting all the pressure points that I was suffering from. I slept good but I did realize after a few days that it was too firm for me. The mattress stopped all the body pain except my shoulders were killing me which made me realize this mattress was not for side sleepers even though it was advertised as such. The rest of my body wasn't hurting anymore but I was waking up stiff which is how I realized the mattress was just too firm. They company refunded me $100 to buy a mattress topper which I did a 3 inch gel memory foam. That i bought because of the so called cooling affect of the gel. That didn't work I wrote another review on that. It was off my bed the 2nd night.Anyway back to Amazon to the 1st one I was researching in the 1st place and decided to finally purchase. Which is this 2 inch latex queen topper. Oh my goodness what a difference where have you been all my life? All the beds I've thrown or given away from being to soft or too hard or gotten too lumpy this mattress topper could have saved me a lot of money.I am a 58 yr. old female 265lbs. All my weight is waist up. My bones are getting weak which is why I bought the "medium firm mattress" in the 1st place. With this latex mattress topper I am on top of it when I lay on it. I do not sink into like memory foam. It provides just the right amount of cushion needed to relieve the firmness from my mattress but I'm still supported. If you have a mattress that's starting to get lumpy or too soft or too hard buy it. You will not regret it. As far as sleeping hot I don't any more than usual. I have hot flashes and I suffer from insomnia. This is not a magic carpet if you suffer from insomnia this will not stop that as insomnia is mental, but if you toss and turn because of a bad mattress that makes you uncomfortable than this is it. My shoulders don't hurt anymore.This is an honest review I was not paid for it. Sorry it was so long but hope it helped. Oh I almost forgot there was no smell that I noticed. I unpacked it on top of my mattress. When i squeezed it Ithought I made a mistake because it felt soft and squishy I continued anyway. I had to pull it up a little which was a little hard to do but not impossible I was glad I didn't tear it. I was already 2 inches so i didn't have to wait until it expanded which i was happy about. It also hangs about an inch and a half on each side. So it's a little too big. I didn't buy the cover instead I put my mattress pad on it to protect it which does the job. The over hang doesn't bother me but it might bother some. Once I put on the mattress pad and my sheet on it smashed it to where I don't really noticed. I'm comfortable now in bed which is more important to me. I highly recommend.

I have tried a variety of mattress toppers, from polyurethane foam, memory foam to pure cotton futons, but nothing beats natrual latex.  It's so soft!It perfectly and quickly adjusts to your body shape without any "memory" effect when you get up.  It's perfect for people who at leasts partially sleep on their sides at night.If you have a very curvy figure I recommend stacking two 3" toppers on top of each other - works amazingly well.  You could even use two such toppers instead of a mattress.This topper is also not hot in summer, surprisingly.I've never slept as well.  Once you try a natural latex - you will never want anything else!

When I received the mattress topper, I noticed a couple of small tears and some ash marks from production. I reached out to customer service, who were incredibly friendly and helpful. They promptly sent me a replacement (the next day), which was much appreciated. The new topper is very comfortable. It did have a slight natural latex smell when I first unpacked it, but after airing it out with fans and an open window for a day, the smell completely dissipated by the time I put it on my bed that evening. I'm very happy with this purchase!

I’ve had this for 2-3 weeks, I’m sleeping without pain now. We have an 8 yr old mattress that must have started sagging, I started getting back problems and it was the mattress not me. So I researched this topper. Ah it really is like a spongey angel food cake. For a 130 lb side sleeper with similar weight husband this is great for the both of us. You can’t feel the original mattress at all and my back is now in alignment. It’s such a relief for much cheaper than a new mattress. When we first got it I thought it had a faint scent of peanut butter or almonds. I don’t notice anything now. My existing mattress cover works fine over it. Really love how plush and comfy it is. It’s plenty thick. I looked from the side and we barely compress that much into it, so it’s got great support. I only wish the corners were rounded. But fits right on a queen if you get the queen size. I’m enjoying a peaceful sleep.

Pairing a soft 3-inch Pure Green topper with a medium Pure Green latex mattress (8.5" thick) seems to be an optimal combination.  We found the 8.5" thick mattress right on the edge of being thick enough, so adding another 3 inches with the topper makes a difference.  You can then adjust the overall softness by having the topper on top (which is the normal way of using the topper), or putting it at the bottom if you want the firmer feel of medium on top, but getting the same 11.5 overall thickness either way.  This is probably a very personal thing, but it seems that many mattress manufacturers that use a combination of foams and springs use this formula of medium/firm for the lower layers which form the majority of the thickness, and soft for the very top layer.

This mattress topper is simply unreal to us. The last week of sleeping has been like heaven!My lower back had some issues 3 years ago and lots of internet research lead me to purchase a full latex mattress at that time. We purchased a firm latex base foam with I think a 3-inch medium latex topper......all contained in the original mattress. Something was just not right. Over time my shoulder began to hurt sometimes in the morning. Once I finally said something to my significant other she let me know how uncomfortable she has been sleeping on our current latex mattress. So we began a new search for something else. I actually found this topper first and ordered it on Amazon.Before the topper arrived we stopped into a local mattress store. We really liked the soft hybrid (springs on the bottom and memory foam on top) feel but felt it "enveloped" us a bit too much and the salesperson felt it might not offer the support we needed. The medium hybrid seemed just a bit too firm and I could not get my shoulder to sink in enough to make it more comfortable when I slept on my side. We also tried their Dream Lux mattress and liked the support and higher quality feel of that foam topping versus any of the hybrid memory foam products. The sales person was good at his job and convinced us to pull the trigger on the medium hybrid mattress.We got home that night and Amazon had delivered our Pure Green topper. The box was sitting at our front door. The decision was to return it to save that money since we had just spent over $ 6k at the mattress store (we also bought an electric moveable bed platform that raised the feet and head). We decided to open the package anyway and potentially "waste" the $ 250 just to try the Pure Green topper.We were stunned. This latex was so much softer then what we had in the mattress we had placed it on. Once we got a mattress pad and sheets on it we were heaven. We literally did not want to get out of bed. Not only did I feel so good when I was resting on my back but I felt the perfect amount of shoulder give and take when sleeping on my side. Better yet we still felt the support from our mattress underneath. We also felt the overall quality and supporting feel this latex foam topper had that for whatever reason any of the mattress stores memory foam mattresses did not have. It is hard to explain but to both of us felt that the memory foam beds had too much give and were kind of cheap in feel. We canceled the mattress store purchase and saved $ 4k of our $ 6k purchase.So one week later and we are still in heaven. I have not slept this good in years. In fact, I think the last time I felt this good sleeping on a mattress was when we purchased a traditional box spring with a large topper built into the mattress.  So what would I recommend to anyone?....* If I had to do it over again and wanted to buy a new mattress I would for sure purchase a latex mattress. I would make the lower portion of the mattress medium and make sure at least 3-4 inches of the top portion was soft.* If you do not want to do the above and feel your current mattress has any sort of support then I would purchase this Pure Green 100% Natural Latex Mattress Topper. We went with the 2 inch option and it is a perfect combination of soft with support. I would assume the 3 inch option would be as good if not even softer but we purchased the 2 inch and it is AWESOME! Also make sure you get a really nice and comfortable topper that secures nicely around the bottom of the bed. It holds it all in place.* Mattress Stores? My best friend had just purchased a soft hybrid a month ago and they love it. They spent $ 5k on everything and to be honest cost should never be the main driver when purchasing a bed. You do spend a third of your life sleeping and your bodies comfort and health should be priority # 1. If you go to a mattress store and really like the memory foam options then go for it. For me/us we love the latex mattress options instead and this Pure Green mattress topper is simply unreal. I also feel that long-term​ the memory foam will form permanent sags in the mattress where this latex foam topper goes right back into place the second we move off of it.FYI we also like the electric base we purchased and decided to have that delivered and keep it. The ability to press the remote and raise our heads and feet to read before bed is really nice. I am also trying to slightly raise the feet at night to see if I can go back to sleeping strictly on my back (which is supposed to be better for you). So far no luck with that and I always end up turning on one of my sides.

I love this mattress topper. Delivery was delayed by FedEx and got lost in their purgatory but customer service with this company was superb. They kept in touch with me until it was finally delivered. I give them. 5 stars but zero stars for FedEx. They are terrible!

I purchased this to go on top of my mattress in my RV which I did not find comfortable... This was excellent in making my mattress Oh so comfortable.

I am a side sleeper and I use to be really large in size. I would always buy super firm mattresses because of my size and my back having issues. I never had hip and shoulder pain. However, as I've lost a considerable amount of weight and I started having hip and shoulder pain. Turns out, because I'm a side sleeper I need a much softer mattress. In other words I lost some of my own personal cushion and as such I need to add some cushion elsewhere to alleviate my pain. My mattress isn't that old and I am not willing to shell out a lot of money for a new high quality mattress just yet. So I thought the next best thing would be a topper.I already use latex pillows so I decided to try a latex topper. I figured it would be the best for me as I sleep hot and I'm worried about a memory foam topper retaining too much heat, especially since I live in Florida where it feels like hades itself opened up in the center of the state.The mattress topper came in really well wrapped and boxed. However, I wish they would use a biodegradable wrapping as opposed to the plastic they use. They make plant based wrapping that would do the same thing for them and be more healthy for our environment but enough about that. Once I unwrapped it from it's cannoli shape and removed it from the second inner wrapping of plastic (really?) I positioned it on the bed to let it air out and regain it's proper shape. The off gassing was very minimal. Those who report horrible off gassing, I'm not sure what you're witnessing because mine had very little. The mattress topper was slightly longer in length than my queen size mattress (less than a 1/2 inch). Also, the mattress topper has sharp corners unlike my mattress which has rounded ones. This is all fine and good.I let the mattress off gas for several hours and then made the bed putting the mattress pad over the topper and then of course bed linens. The first night I slept on it I over slept! I NEVER over sleep and I am usually awake before my alarm. I must have been sleeping so well I turned the alarm off and went back to sleep. I didn't wake until I got a call from my boss wondering where I was as I'm never late for work without calling.First thing I noticed, besides that I overslept that morning, was the pain in my shoulders and hips were not present! So it appears I have found the solution to needing to buy a new mattress and alleviating the pain in my shoulders and hips.I did not opt for the model with the cover since I was going to put a mattress protector over it.Pros: Pain is gone, very comfy, very little to no off gassing.Cons: May over sleep because you're so comfortable.

We bought a new mattress that was way too hard. I found this new topper on Amazon and it made her new bed so comfortable. We love it.

I bought a 3" thick, Soft, Queen-sized topper from this company (Pure Green). The topper arrived very quickly (earlier than expected), undamaged, in a smaller package than expected. The topper was very compressed and nearly vacuum sealed. It was a little clumsy to open up and unroll but no problems were encountered. I let it expand and "breathe" overnight before using it (it's rather heavy and very "bouncy" - challenging to move around when unpacked and unrolled). Yes, there was a distinct "rubber" smell (it reminded me of balloons). The next day, the smell seemed to be less than before. The quality of the latex is pretty good. On the end and bottom, there were some minor deformities (caused by air bubbles). None of these was bad enough for me to worry about. The material seemed sturdy and highly stretchy. I was honestly worried it would be too soft for my 285 lb. weight.When I flipped it over and inspected the top side, it was free of any imperfections. The "ventilation holes" (spread around 1 - 2" apart) were symmetrical and deep. They also went right up the the edges of the topper. I was pleased with the construction - it seemed to be of high quality.When I bought this product, Pure Green recommended an affordable, breathable cover to also buy, so I bought it. I had always intended to cover it anyway. The topper cover was excellent and fairly easy to put on. A zipper runs all the way around the seem of it. The end of the zipper got unzipped when I was preparing to put the topper in it  and it was a little tricky to rezip it once the topper was placed on/in it... but it wasn't too bad - manageable by only one person). The cover dramatically muted the rubber smell and was very soft to the touch.Once I got the covered topper on my Queen-sized mattress (which is only about 7 months old - it's a firm, spring mattress), it matched my mattress size almost exactly. It was easy to move into position. I covered both of these with a new mattress cover (that was recommended when I bought the topper and it's cover). The mattress cover fit perfectly over both and further reduced any rubber smells. After weeks of use, I'm pleased to report that the topper and cover remained in place and didn't shift at all in the night.Being a 58-yr. old, big guy with broad shoulders (I used to be an athlete and weight-lifter), my new firm mattress was wrecking me each and every night. I often woke with back and hip pain in the morning, which took it's toll on my during the day. Since I've used this topper, I had no hip or back pain whatsoever. This topper actually wasn't too soft at all - it complimented my firm mattress perfectly. I never got hot in the night; I never sank in too far and pretty much all of my body felt supported and comfortable. I usually sleep on my side and sometimes my stomach - no problems and no more pain in the morning. Bliss! My 130 lb., 60+ yr. old wife laid on the mattress (I sleep alone on it) and she said she felt very comfortable on it too.I believe this product has a 10-yr. warranty. It has exceeded my expectations and caused me to sleep so much better than before. I'm extremely pleased and highly recommend it.P.S. There is no longer any hint of rubber smell at all, whatsoever. Double bliss!

Hellllo, Amazon shoppers!  First of all, please know that I review almost every item I buy - whether it be from Amazon or not. I am an older woman and I remember the days when you went into a store and the people working there actually knew their products and could help you decide what you might need (or not need) by giving you valuable information. Well, welcome to 2020 where I have learned to be discerning and to rely on my own research and read what other people have written in their reviews of products. But every once in awhile I find a company that has that has the trifecta...a wonderful product, really good customer service AND knowledgeable employees who readily share that knowledge with the consumer. SleepOnLatex is one such company.  I decided on a mattress topper, because my mattress (from that company we ALL know, based in the Netherlands) was in good shape and nice and firm. The problem was there was this ripple in it that I could not get out and it drove me crazy. As a lot of people, I naturally thought of getting a memory foam topper until I started reading about natural latex and that's how I found the Pure Green 100% Natural Latex Mattress Topper on Amazon. Not only were the reviews spectacular, but I learned a lot about natural latex - where it is found in the world, how it is harvested and how it is cured to come to the state you find it in a mattress or mattress topper. Admittedly, this might be way too much information for most people, but I just wanted to let you know that I did read a lot and it was interesting. Okay, back to the company and the mattress topper-----after realizing that I wanted this product, I took my weight, firmness preference and how high I wanted the topper (1", 2" or 3") into consideration and I purchased a 2-inch medium/firm queen mattress topper. I put it on my bed, covered the mattress topper with a new mattress pad and then my sheets and couldn't wait to try it that night. it was okay, but I could tell it was lacking something in the comfort department, because it was too firm.  I placed to call to customer service at SleepOnLatex and I spoke with and awesome gentleman, Joe, who asked me some questions and after a couple of minutes we decided that I would probably be happiest with the 3" soft topper.  Knowing that there is no way anybody could get an unrolled mattress topper back in the box it originally came in, he sent me a larger box to return the initial 2" topper I had gotten.  I went back on Amazon, initiated that return and purchased the 3", soft queen.  It arrived in a few days and I was soooo excited to try it out, but I waited until that night. Oh my goddess! It is perfection!  I'm never leaving my bed!  LOL.1. Read about the advantages of NATURAL latex. It's super interesting.2. Check out the SleepOnLatex company. Read their story - a business combining  humanity and sustainability3. I thought I knew what was best for me, but didn't. Make a quick call to the company and let them help you decide.4. This mattress topper, by its construction, has holes all through it. I'm almost 70 and it was easy to maneuver onto my bed and position it, BUT don't grab a small spot and pull the topper. Instead, I found it's much easier (and safer for the topper) to hold an area of an edge and kind of lift it and shift the position as it's slightly off your mattress. This avoids the latex topper from "catching" the mattress fabric.5. ENJOY!

The topper itself was beautifully constructed. I liked the holes in the topper for the purpose of heat reduction. My problem! My body rejected the Latex. I requested to return the topper. Only a few questions were asked and the company promptly refunded my money. “I wish that more companies would stand behind their products like Sleep on Latex!”“Thank you for your fantastic service!”

I was using 2” memory foam but for some reason the crappy Casper bed was never comfortable. I think my sleeping issues were partly because of feeling too warm at night.Decided to try this pad out. Wow, the bed is finally comfortable. This pad worked better than I anticipated.

This is the best purchase I have ever made. I purchased a new hybrid mattress but it is too firm for me. I added a foam topper to help it not feel so firm, but I would sink into the foam and did not like that. This latex topper feels heavenly. I do not sink into it, it cradles me. I will never be without a latex mattress again! For reference, I am 115lbs and prefer a softer mattress.

It is very comfortable and easy to put on the bed runs a bit wide for a queen but we are enjoying the comfort it provides

We have a $2700 P6 Sleep Number matress set.After my husband had a stroke, he had problems getting in and out of our sleep number bed.  The bed was high, and although he's a tall man, he lost strength in his left arm and leg.  He slid out several times, crushing the side support and stretching the outer material encasing everything.  The inner support foam was distorted, stretched out of shape.  As a result, you felt like you were falling out of bed on that side.  Fortunately, these beds can be rebuilt.I replaced the side bolsters, but it's imperative that the pillow top enclosure stays tight, because it holds everything together.  I used strong buttonhole thread to stitch along the bottom, taking up the 2 1/2" that the covering had stretched.  Now the side is held straight again without bowing and tilting.I still needed to replace the foam for the top of the air chambers.  The air chambers in this mattress, which is about 10 years old, are 1" below the top of the foam sides.  We have a queen sized bed.I decided to change the type of foam used in the support layers.  The foam they used was memory foam, which have a tendency to dip after a while, because the foam doesn't recover quickly. It gets misshapened.  I'm using 1",  high density foam,  and 3" thick medium firm latex on top. Because of their quick recovery, these will keep the bed top even, so the dreaded "dip" doesn't form.I ordered the FULL size high density foam to top the chambers.  I had to cut ~ 2" off the bottom to fit inside the sides.  The foam fit perfectly.  It's proving to be the perfect type of foam to form the inner support layer.I replaced the 3" queen sized memory foam with this 3" latex topper.  The latex topper is placed over everything, edge to edge, and zippered in.The bed is like brand new.  I've since replaced the bed frame so it's lower for my husband.If you have a sleep number bed that's sagging, what I've done is the solution.  The total cost, including new sides, was less than $400.  If you had to order everything from a bed repair site, the cost would have been close to $800 (not including a new zippered outer covering).  The cost of OEM parts are outrageous.I still have full adjustability, but the new foam layers recover immediately, keeping the bed level and comfortable.  I'm glad I used latex instead of memory foam.

This is the second mattress topper we've bought from this company (the first was for our RV several years ago). We appreciate that these toppers are natural latex, they have no odor, and they provide a nice amount of cushioning without being too soft. And you don't end up overheating during the night like you do with memory foam.

Long story short I have called,  and emailed these people and have received nothing but pleasurable interactions paired with phenomenal knowledge.  I got a 3 inch soft topper and and it has changed the game for me.  I literally have owned every single type of bed/ topper this is finally it.  My back and hips are just feeling so much better.  This has given me zero doubt that I will be purchasing there mattress soon. If you are questioning anything call them first like I did.  They will answer and if you're package is damaged or something isn't right they will go above and beyond for you and there products reputation to make it right.  This is something we do not get to much of anymore these days. I have literally 3 people who have tried it out and are going to buy them.  It's just perfect.  Again everybody is different and has unique desires and needs so I'm not saying this is a one topper fits all, but I have personally tried pretty much everything.. too the point of landing on a latex topper lol not because I knew our ever heard about them.  I never knew this type of mattress or topper existed either only because of my sad need for a good night's sleep I always went with the 50k plus 4.9 star online review stuff and it always let me down.  I hope anyone reading this does pull the trigger and has my personal experience.  Good luck and god bless!

My wife had problems waking up  early because she was sore. We have a nice mattress but it's a bit too firm for my wife. This has helped a lot. Well made, nice cover and provides excellent support without being too firm.

I never really leave reviews for things, but this felt worth putting some time into. I did a LOT to research to find a mattress topper that was natural, non-toxic, doesn’t make you sweat a bunch, isn’t too thick, isn’t too pillowy, etc.The king mattress we received from our landlord (we moved in to a fully furnished home) was brand new but pretty hard. My partner and I wake up with numb limbs and toss & turn most of the night. We finally said “enough” and I dove down the mattress-topper-research rabbit hole. It’s overwhelming in there…I don’t recommend it.I finally settled in this bad boy after hours of searching and comparing (and digging into the company to see if they’re greenwashing or actually legit). It checked all the boxes, and here we are. Laying on my “new” bed, more comfortable than I’ve been in months! Not sweaty! Not too soft! Doesn’t smell like chemicals (there is a natural latex scent but it goes away), and it inflated rather easily/quickly.If you’re looking for something durable, affordable, natural, and not too soft but not too firm, you’re in the right spot. Highly recommend!

This is a great 3" all-latex topper. It's soft, comfortable, and very cool to sleep on — I used it on top of my organic Avocado mattress to add some additional cushion instead of opting for the sewn-in pillow top. It sort of feels like sleeping on a fresh (non-stale) marshmallow or fluffy cheesecake LOL... not sure how else to describe it. It definitely has bounce/springiness to it (does NOT feel at all like memory foam — it's a way better experience than that).But, personally, I think it might be just a bit too soft for me. I have lower back pain/arthritis, and while this is a comfortable topper to lay on, sometimes the softness can cause a bit too much sinking in and/or make it difficult to get up in the morning (in an ow my lower back hurts way). But, then again, sometimes this isn't the case, either. For reference, I'm 6' tall and weight 220lbs, so for smaller humans it may work well, as you wouldn't sink in as much. Really it depends on you, your body, and your preferences.I think for anyone looking for a soft, 100% natural mattress topper, this is a fantastic and affordable option — but maybe consider the 2" instead of the 3", depending on the mattress you have underneath. One inch doesn't sound like much of a difference, but it is.It's also worth noting that some people may not enjoy the slight odor of natural latex, but I like it — it smells fresh in a way. And it's WAY better than the smell (and negative health effects) of synthetic foams.One thing to note, though... these 3" toppers are fairly heavy and difficult to move. To move/store it, I have to fold it in half and roll it up, then wrap a small rope around it several times and tie it to secure it in place. And it does take up quite a bit of storage space if not on the bed, but... well, that's fine. Just something to note.

I have a recently purchased WINK latex mattress and it is great, just not as soft as I would have liked so I ordered this, Soft - 2 Inch - Queen Size, and what an upgrade!  I am so much more comfortable and for the last couple of nights I sleep has been in the 7.5+ hours solid.  Made a tremendous difference in comfort and sleep quality.I did have to trim my topper because it was about 4" too long and wide.  Easy enough with an electric knife.The topper didn't have any odor I could detect.  Came vacuum sealed and quickly expanded to full size.100% recommended (Soft - 2 Inch - Queen Size)

We bought the 2" soft queen-size pad. After just 1 night of sleeping on this, I and my wife's post-sleep aches started to fade. After a few days, gone. Amazing. We didn't experience any of the negatives noted by some purchasers. No off-gassing, no pad movement. Very cool. The pad itself was pretty light and easy to maneuver. Parts of the foam will indeed break off if you pull hard on it, so don't pull on it! What we don't know is whether it will develop depressions, or collapse at the edges from sitting there to put on shoes, etc. But after about 3 weeks, the experience is perfect, and it saved us a lot of $$ to not replace the mattress. BTW, we have a padded pillow-top separate from the mattress (which had become ineffective) that we wrapped around this, so we didn't need a cover.  Best purchase we've made in a while.

We bought this mattress topper over 4 years ago and I fully expected it to start to sag or fall apart by now, but it’s still kickin! After all this time I still have no complaints.I was very worried buying it initially because I didn’t want to have to deal with the hassle of returning by mail a queen mattress topper, but was relieved when we liked it so much after initially trying it.I don’t recall what the delivery experience was like or if the topper had a strong smell initially as it was so long ago, so I can’t speak to that but it has remained just as soft and plush as when we first got it and we use it each and every day.I don’t exactly know how to explain how the topper feels, but I much prefer it to memory foam. I don’t feel like I sink in and get trapped in the bed like I do with memory foam. Also, I haven’t noticed ever feeling overly hot when sleeping on the topper. I feel like it dissipates heat well in the warmer months. I really don’t have any complaints other than the price, but with how long it lasts I suppose that isn’t even an issue.In fact, the reason I’m writing this review is because we’re thinking about upgrading to a king and regardless of which mattress we buy we wanted to get another one of these toppers in king size.In my opinion, you can’t go wrong with this topper (as long as you don’t have a latex allergy). If you’re on the fence about which mattress topper is right for you, I say go with this one.

Bought this to replace a memory foam topper that was too hot.I really enjoy this latex topper. I don't find it to be too warm to sleep on. I also haven't had any issues with my arms falling asleep like the other topper.There was a smell to the topper but I let it sit out for a few days and I use it under a mattress protector.Would definitely recommend this topper

I own a medium firm queen SOL mattress x 5 years which has been great but over time and a shoulder injury I found it too firm as a side sleeper and I started waking up sore.  Almost purchased a topper from tempurpedic at Costco but I am so glad I didn‘t, since it felt much too soft and I could tell it would have that „sinking in“ feeling.  Then I went back to read reviews about SLO toppers and decided to give it a try since I like the customer servie and organic business practices they provide. After talking to their phone customer service staff member  I purchased the 2 inch soft mattress topper and I have to admit I wish I would have done that at the time of my mattress purchase.  My bed is so much more comfortable now and I am SO glad I decided against a „conventional“ topper.  I do think the 3 inch would have been too soft for me and the 1 inch too thin, therefore the 2 inch was perfect to add a level of comfort to a still good mattress in order to modify it to help with shoulder and lower back issues.  Thanks, SOL for fast shipping ( 2 days with USPS ) and offering products on Amazon now.

Great Product! For years, we have tried different beds and never succeeded in getting a good comfortable nights sleep.  Recently, due to lack of sleep, took up this project again of finding the "right bed"; regardless of price.I read many customer reviews on many name brand beds, watched infomercials on Sleep Number vs Perfect Sleeper and researched for hours on hybrid mattress and DIY.  I came to the conclusion that the best reviews were on hybrids that had a firm foundation, medium middle and soft top.  Longest lasting foundation seemed to be a heavy duty innerspring mattress, not microcoil or pocket coil as they feel good in the beginning, but they're weak and give out quickly.The best foam is this Dunlop natural latex so I got a 2" medium and 2" soft and used together on the older queen coil (innerspring) mattress in the guest room and we tried it out for a couple months and found it has been a wonderful change and change our sleep (our health).Desiring to move this same configuration to a California King in our room, I went looking for an innerspring mattress with firm heavy gauge coils between 7-9 inches, but wasn't finding that exact match, so went with the LinenSpa 6" innerspring mattress with heavy duty coils and topped with the Pure Green Natural Latex, one 2" medium and a 2" soft and the result was another fantastic sleeping bed for just over $600 in Cal King size!Because the product combination of HD coils and real latex are all the longest lasting materials, we expect lots of great sleep for a long time.  If one of the components seems to fail over time, it's easy to replace just one for a couple hundred and buying all over is still an awesome price!IF a couple has very different preferences in firmness feel, you can cut the toppers in half and mix or layer them differently.  For example, you can put the medium firmness on top on one side and the soft on top of the other side; buy a total zippered mattress cover of 4" height and arrange the halves inside as you want.  You could also add a firm topper among the choices to use and buy a twin one to cut if only one person wants a very firm mattress on their side.So glad we found this information and hope it's helpful to others.  There's nothing more powerful to your health than a good nights sleep and it's great to wake up without back or hip pain!

After 5 years of sleeping on a very expensive memory foam mattress that was exacerbating my lower back issues, I over corrected and purchased a brand new coil spring, tight top, extra firm Beauty Rest mattress. It felt great lying on it for a few minutes in the store, but turned out to be way too firm for me as I am a side sleeper.Not sure what to expect from latex, I first bought a 1" firm Sleep On Latex topper. As advertised, the topper provided a slight tweak to the firmness of the mattress, but my arms and shoulders were still falling asleep. Next, I bought a 1" medium topper to place on top of the firm topper. That also helped, but was still a bit firm. Finally, I removed the the 1" firm and bought a 2" soft to place on top of the 1" medium topper. This was perfect! Except, it slept hot compared to the firm and medium toppers, so I flipped them over and put the 1" medium over the 2" soft. I was expecting to be upset at the loss of comfort in doing this, but it has actually worked out very nicely. Now my bed feels like a professional commercial grade bed with plenty of support and a layer of consistent, plush, luxury on top.My husband is a back sleeper and likes a firm mattress. He was happy with the bare mattress and equally happy with all of the different topper combinations, so I think it's fair to say that none of the density levels are overly soft.I put the 1" firm topper on my guest bed which is a Tuft & Needle mattress that was a bit too soft and it has made a small but noticeable difference.Main observations from someone who has slept on all three firmness levels -1.) The firmness ratings are accurate. If you are a side sleeper, firm will probably be too much for you. Soft is great for relieving pressure points, but it is not too squishy either.2.) These toppers are VERY supportive no matter which density you choose. You will not sink in or bottom out, even on the 1" topper. For reference, my husband and I are both of average BMI (23-25) and both weigh under 200lbs.3.) As advertised, 1" = a tweak, 2" = a very noticeable change, 3" = a total makeover.4.) The firmness of your base layer makes a huge difference - if you're starting out with a very firm surface, you won't regret buying a "soft" topper and if you have a really soft mattress like my Tuft & Needle was, a "firm" topper will help a lot.5.) The soft topper does sleep hotter than the firm and medium.When all was said and done, I ended up spending a lot of money to experiment with these toppers, but considering I got a reasonable deal on my mattress and did not buy a fancy one, I still feel like I came out ahead and will have a great bed that should last me a good long time. I am sure that having a 3" layer of latex over the mattress will help prevent body indentations from forming prematurely. Thank you, Sleep On Latex! I really felt like an idiot for buying the "wrong" mattress. Your toppers made everything "RIGHT" again. :)

We've slept on this topper for two years now and it's still in great shape. We purchased the 2" topper and have found it both comfortable and cool

The three inch soft completely changed my firm mattress! I'm a side sleeper and it is so nice for my hip and shoulder to sink in but still feel supported.

Review is at 30 days of use.Context: Weight 150 lb / Pounds. 35 years old. Single back sleeper with no back injuries.  Mattress is a new Doctors Choice Elite Firm with this 2" Soft latex topper.Short version: I love it and I'm so glad I made this investment for myself.  Quality sleep is so important.Feel: It's perfect for me. I love the instant bounce back and can't imagine sleeping on regular memory foam now. I use a mattress pad on top to add further softness for cheaper.Smell/odor: I consider my sensitivity to smell to be average. I let the topper air out in my living room for 2 days before use.  At first I put a mattress pad (not plastic lined) on top of this latex topper.  The odor wasn't strong, but it was still definitely noticeable and I wasn't sure it was something I could live with. I was especially concerned that when summer comes and it's hotter it will get worse.I then put a vinyl/plastic mattress protector directly on top of the latex topper. Then I put a quilted mattress pad on top of that.  This was the solution. I can no longer smell it with my nose pressed into the bed or in the air.  The mattress protector is the barrier I needed.

Love this topper, I decided to spend a little more and boy is it worth it. Super comfortable, a huge improvement over some of the cheaper toppers. highly recommended.

If you're debating on buying this topper, just do it. SleepOnLatex has the absolute best customer service I've ever experienced. My fiance (5'4 130lbs, pregnant) and I (5'10 195lbs, not pregnant but look it) have a Sleep Number bed (do not buy a Sleep Number bed, ever), and after 3 years, we've been at a crossroads. I broke 2 vertebrae in my thoracic spine 6 years ago, and have had so much pain in the middle of my back when sleeping. The Sleep Number has made that worse, as it produces pressure points on my ribs and makes me sleep unaligned (I'm a side sleeper, and air mattresses offer passive resistance, so no matter how "soft" your setting, it'll still feel hard). We didn't want to shell-out another $2k+ on a mattress, so out of desperation and a lot of research, we went with this topper.Before taking it out of the plastic, I thought it was going to be way too soft to offer any support. So, we initiated a return and purchased the firm. The firm was WAY too firm and resistant, and our deadline to return both was approaching. I reached out to SoL and they were SO accommodating, and said they would accept the return of both even if Amazon doesn't, and they sent out two large boxes to get our toppers in, since it's impossible to get them back into the original box. We decided to give the soft a shot, because why not, and I'm SO glad we did. It's made me look forward to going to bed now, and has increased the quality of our sleep SIGNIFICANTLY. It's incredibly comfortable, and due to it being latex, it offers some resistance, and does not sink in like a memory foam topper would. As active side sleepers, we need something that doesn't completely envelope us and take time to adjust like memory foam does.It does kind-of have an odor of latex gloves, but nowhere near what the firm had. With time and a mattress cover, it's hardly noticeable, if at all. It's also pretty heavy and slides a bit, so I definitely recommend getting a topper cover with straps for the bed corners.Overall, 9/10, will do business with again.

Very good brand, flavorful

The original stuff is soft, sweet and incredibly biologically friendly, even for me. I am starting to see it disappear though. I don't know if it's a supply issue, or they're getting rid of it or something, but it's incredibly frustrating. There aren't a lot of teas I can drink, and many of them I can't drink for long before my body throws a fit. They are now bringing into circulation something with 'Wellness Support' in the title and it's awful. The taste is so overwhelming that I feel like my head gets overheated and muzzy and my stomach doesn't like me very much. The boxes are similar so watch out!!!

My favorite tea to have with honey before bed. Tastes great, feels calming and helps my digestive.

Once I got the replacement from the wind blowing the first one off, it was excellent.

This flavor is good

The only complaint I have about this tea is the fact that it took 2 months to get it. Well I guess if we get sick again we'll have it in advance.....

I really like this product and the variety of flavors.  I often give the variety package as a gift.

I know these two herbs are very good for one's immune system, but I cannot get past the horrible taste.  In the garbage, ugh!

The Pukka Elderberry/Echinacea tea is sweet. If you like a sweeter herbal tea, this may be for you.  My personal preference is for a stronger fruity flavor. The elderberry flavor is not dominant, much to my dismay

Delicious tea, just add water and honey

I was not expecting one of the main ingredients to be black licorice. Nasty stuff🤢

Ok

I actually like the taste. I added a little honey and some fresh lemon. However, I think this tea made my tummy hurt. Maybe I just have to get used to it? Not sure yet. I’ll update this once I try more of this product.

I only purchased this tea due to Covid 19 and to build my immune system. The tea itself doesnt tastes the best in my opinion. Its sort’ve grassy/woodsy flavored.

The taste is different

So I will drink it because echinacea is good for you, but the flavor is just tolerable, not delicious.

This Tea makes me mellow and calm ! It's great before bed!

This tea is what my household drinks when we need a boost or when we are sick. It has a great flavor and helps the body really well

Very strong but delicious got really bad covid and it was just what I needed and very strong for my messed up tastebuds

This help me get knock out my cold w/in a few days of drinking daily. The flavor is okay with honey. I also feel like Amazon overcharge for some of the products

Loved this tea....I put a fairy-free creamer with it with it and it felt very comforting. I loved the almost fruity, earthy flavor of it...will order again.

This is the greatest tea has a wonderful flavor

Tea bags damaged grains all coming out

My husband loves to drink this before work.

I love the tea

This tea is more like a dessert! So tasty and feels good in my system...

It was so good but when stewing it had a funny smell kind of like plastic

Flavorful

I love this tea, especially if you feel a cold coming on.  Its very comforting.

Unfortunately, before I bought this, I did not do my research. Google: Using yerba mate long-term, especially with alcohol or nicotine, has been linked to an increased risk of various types of cancer, including stomach, kidney, lung, and mouth cancer. Don't confuse yerba mate with caffeine or other caffeine sources, such as green tea, black tea, and guarana. WASTE OF MONEY CAN'T RETURN.

It was delivered inside a mailing envelope that was in perfect condition and another tea package also in perfect condition, therefore it was already broken when it was placed in the mailing envelope.

product arrived ripped open and not usable. Might as well burn your money instead of buy this. Was so looking forward to trying this product as I thought it would come in an intact safe product to use, but recieved a ripped open bag that I cannot safely use, nor return or request a replacement. I want a replacement 😩 bummed it came damaged! Do not buy!

I’ve had this tea before from Whole Foods and it’s very good.But, I would be careful ordering it because the packaging is sooo light it will easily rip. Literally, it’s so fragile that just pulling on it a bit will cause it to tear. Mine came ripped and it probably happened from the driver simply handling it. They need to spend a little more money and make secure packaging.

The package came opened and is not eligible for replacement.

extremely weak , not what I expected. I would not buy it again

No complaints.  It's excellent any time of day.

Excellent tasting tea. It arrived quickly and is in a sealable bag. Will definitely buy again.

First time I tried this I felt the effects for 3 days.  Might be my biology, but this stuff gives me a huge hit, totally not like coffee.  It did disrupt my sleep a bit, but the energy and focus were worth it.  I drink it now every few days, can't do every day.

This is my first time using this and I love it. I was afraid I wouldn’t like the taste but it’s not bad at all. I use this  everyday n will continue drinking this daily.

I Iove this company who hasn’t sold its soul to cooperate greed. Keep it up! Great yours and tasting room if you ever visit Sebastopol Ca.

Good quality tea.

Will buy again!

I like the taste and the healthy benefits of yerba mate tea.

Really love this tea- alot in the package- nice light taste and definitely suppressed appetite in the evenings. It's a winner.

My husband drink tea everyday at work.

I purchased these hoping to save some money on the cans of the same brand that I buy. In order to get the same caffeine amount as on can, you have to boil 5-6 tea bags. I didn’t notice the energy boost I do with the can. I will not be purchasing again.

always good gentle pick me up

Will purchase again on subscription

Tried this brand and was pleasantly surprised about the smooth flavor. Great Green Tea!

Came individually wrapped in a sealed bag.  I like the taste and convenience of it

This product is great. I do notice that I have more energy when I drink it.

This large pack of tea was a good deal.  I like the health benefits and the energy boost from this tea.

This right here is literally liquid smoke to me and felt amazing for non smoker. I felt energized keeps me going and focus through the day. Overall satisfied and amazed as yerba mate drinker.

One bag makes several cups. Good taste, just enough caffeine

This is just what we were looking for. Has a nice kick but doesn't give you the gut ache that coffee can

Great tea, I feel the effects.

Arrived quickly. Very satisfied

I really like the taste of this product

The bags are well packed, fresh and tasty

I love this tea

great taste. great energy. great smell. LOVE THIS TEA

Better vibe than coffee with more antioxidants

Good stuff

This gives me great energy and mood enhancement to start my day. I have chronic illness and fatigue and this has made a difference in my mornings.

This is my hubby’s favorite tea.  Always have it on hand.

Love this tea

I've drank this for years now, love it

We use this product almost daily.

Good tea, I have a cup every morning with some raw unfiltered honey

Every single day I look forward to waking up and taking my first sip of yerba mate, specifically the mint flavor. Absolutely the best 11/10 I love it so much. I can safely say this drink brings me JOY ❤️

Healthy alternative to drinks out there.

When it comes to tea, I am usually very particular about what I chose to drink and the taste. But I am a huge fan of Pukka brand and the types of teas it makes, which is why I bought Pukka Organic Love herbal tea. I love the chamomile, rose, and lavender combination. The perfect tea to enjoy with my husband and when friends and family visit. Great evening tea to relax and unwind after a long day. Smells amazing and tastes delicious. I highly recommend this particular tea and plan on purchasing more. It's caffeine free and smells incredible! Just place one tea bag in a cup, infuse it for up to 15 minutes and enjoy! Easy to open packaging and steeps well.

It’s hard to critique a tea flavor. This is one of my favorite of all time. Very yummy and relaxing.

Extremely floral with a very nice rose aftertaste.  My favorite tea flavor!

Just sad I have to order it and can't find it in stores anymore

Imo I enjoyed the taste. You taste all of the tea. Tastes decadent with vanilla almond milk added. Great value for the money

I love taking herbs in the for of teas. Herbs have amazing benefits. I like the flower teas. This one has an enjoyable floral flavor. Yes to this one. Health is wealth.

UPDATE: Changed to 5 stars. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. They sent my missing boxes of tea. They want to know if there is a fulfillment issue.Would be 5 stars, however like so many others, I received ONE 20 count of a pack of THREE. . Please contact me for my order number and ship the other TWO boxes of 20 count. The "LOVE" blend of Chamomile with lavendar and rose tea is delicious.

A friend gave me this same tea as a gift and I loved it so much I wanted to buy more. I was excited to share with my friends. However, the tea I received, which shipped from EU, barely has any aroma when you open the single wrapped tea bags and virtually no flavor when brewed. I opened two of the boxes- same problem.  The box is stamped with origin, dates etc that all seem good, but there's a quality problem somewhere in the supply chain. The item is not eligible for refund.

I like Pukka Love, rose, chamomile & lavender.  Got it from my daughter before.  Remember how much I liked the tea.  So I found it in Amazon and placed one order of 3 packs at once.  One order of 3 packs was too confuse for the shipping department.  It took 3 times for me to get my completed ONE order, 1 pack each time.

Soooo keep an eye on that especially if you have allergies!

I bought a three pack and received one box that has been crushed open. Extremely unhappy with my order.Edit: I ordered a replacement and once again received only One Box. I added the second picture as proof of this as well. I'm amazed it wasn't crushed in this mailer.

Only received one box of tea NOT the 3 boxes advertised. Amazon tried to replace it, and once again only sent me one box of tea. So now I've paid for 3 boxes and have only received 2. Amazon won't give me a refund since they already "replaced" the first mishap.

The product advertisers as a 3 pack of 20. I received only a single 20 packUpdate: requested a replacement as I was shorted 2 boxes. I received one additional box and am not permitted further action. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!

I did receive all 3 boxes. Saw some reviews saying otherwise.Pretty packaging, but did not like the flavor of the tea. Tasted bitter and expired.Will not buy again.

The product is great!!!! Seller however ONLY delivers ONE product instead of the the THREE that is described. I tried having the problem resolved and the product resent and again only ONE box as shipped! This is a total rip off!!!!!

I can taste a bit of chamomile, but that's about it. No color, no taste. Very disappointed.

This showed up with a messed up box and yes ONE box of tea-Not 3 like it says. Do not buy from here.The tea itself is great, one of my favorites.

I did not receive the 3 boxes of tea that I was suppose to. I only received one.

I love this tea. It is delicious, soothing and great to drink before going to bed.I purchased a 3 count pack and I ONLY RECEIVED ONE PACK!!!!!! Where are my other 40 sachets!!!!!

I love this tea but was charged $15 for one box!!!!!!? Not right I've ordered this before and think my order was mixed up??

Pukka Love, Organic Herbal Tea With Chamomile & Lime Flower (3 Pack, 60 Tea Bags)  ONLY RECEIVED ONE  NOT THREE

Only received one pack. Should've looked at the reviews before buying. But delicious.

Only received one box. Not three as is shows on the description and photos

THis is advertised as a 3-pak and I was sent 1 box of tea.

I bought this 3 box pack but one 1 box came.

The taste was like old shoes boiled and the smell was wet dog.  Trashed.

I only received one pack. It was supposed to be three.

The description says 3 boxes and I only received one

Barely you taste the flavor, takes so long to see the taste and color in the hot water

Received the wrong one!! Not happy

Very weak taste.

From the pretty pink cover, you'd think there was a nice flowery, rosy, maybe even a berry tea. It's mostly chamomile.  And very weak flavor.  Like drinking chamomile water.  I wanted to love it but don't.

I've always loved this product. It used to have a deep cardamom flavor, but now it just tastes like chamomile tea. Not what I was looking for.

The tea is great, it's one of my favourites. But this listing is a scam! The image makes it look like three boxes but you only get one, which makes this ridiculously expensive. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.

misleading photo of 3 boxes, messaged amazon but nth changed.just avoid

SCAM!!! The photo shows 3 boxes. Only 1 box is delivered

First off, I want to say. I adore this tea. I have boughten Pukka tea multiple times and my favorite is the Love Tea. Highly aromatic and tastes wonderful.That being said, the last 5 orders I’ve ordered have been missing 90% of the order. I am only shipped one item out of a multipack. This is with all my orders not just this tea. In this case, I ordered a multipack of the Love tea (comes with 3 boxes), and I was shipped one. It was shipped with other heavy items I ordered separately and was smashed upon arrival. I have contacted amazon with each order and continue have these problems. If you want to order, be sure to order ahead of time to ensure you have time to complain and get a replacement. In my case even replacements have not been shipped out properly!

Barely flavors the water. Super mild. Can’t pick up on the rose taste. Basically just a watery chamomile tea.

Ordered 3 boxes for 60 tea bags, only received 1 box for 20 total tea bags. Good tea, but dsappointed to not receive my full order amount!

Don't buy on here. It's listed as a 3 pack and I only received one. You're best to go to the store and get off Amazon.

Too mild and rooty for my taste. Now I’m stuck with 3 boxes. Great packaging and message though!

Little bit too bitter tasting to me .

For me I did not care for this as much as other ones from Pukka.  I have the same flavors in other brands that I like better because I enjoy a stronger tea. If you like mild teas this one would be for you

Love this tea! Great flavor!

This tea is so yummy and relaxing. My daughter said "mom we need to stock up and always have this"

So happy with this tea! Can't say enough!!!

I love this herb tea. It has a hint of sweetness and smells great.

This is a wonderful way to sync your mind and body! Light taste of warming flavors & you don’t have to add any sweetener to it, tastes great by itself, it’s calming and puts everything at ease & its ingredients are wholesome & good. A sensation for the entire You!

This tea is wonderful! Pukka makes great teas and I have no problem with that. The problem is what I got which was one box when I brought a set of three boxes. Please look at your orders when fulfilling them. Amazon your service is usually great, but not so today.

Just came in today and tried it and I love it the combination of flavors are great will definitely be buying more soon Really good value to originally onley whanted one box but glad their was three of them good value to

arrived quickly , great product

My favorite calming herbal tea. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of chamomile but the lavendar and rose give it a lovely taste and aroma. Boxed with the word "Love" prominent it is a cute gift. It's terrific that it is organic but it is kind of spendy. I'm still a fan.

This tea is one of my favorites. It’s sweet, aromatic, not perfume way different,  and the packaging is so pretty. I’ve even given this tea as a gift because I want others to enjoy it as much as I do.

I discovered this tea in NYC back in 2016 and i have been hooked ever since. Now i have my bf, family, and coworkers hooked on it. Their matcha one is excellent too

This herbal tea is the BOMB DIGGITY. It makes a great warm treat with no caffeine.  It has a very subtle sweetness worth noting. I usually sweeten tea to taste but "love" needs no sugar. It can be hard to come by but not on Amazon ;)

I’m so obsessed with this tea. It’s seriously all I drink and I’ve tried a ton of different teas. Extra bonus: I always sleep better after having a cup or two of this.

Sadly I only received one box...I am sure I had ordered a three pack...bummer because I love this tea! 🫖

Love it, albeit Pukka teas are expensive.

Absolutely delicious, gentle flavor.  With a name like, "Love," what's not to like?

The most delicious tea! It has a perfect balance of rose, chamomile and lavender-with a hint of licorice so no sweetener needed. Big fan of this relaxing blend.

I tried this tea at my moms house and fell in love with it. Very floral and lovely. My new favorite

Love this tea!  It has such a nice mellow taste and I feel very relaxed when I drink it!

I love the flavor of this.

It has helped me to relax before going to bed, and I am able to get a better night of sleep.

everything about this tea is wonderful. taste and it is very relaxing

Best relaxing tea around!

It is quite expensive

I like it as something different than my normal high caffeine intake. It was pricier than average, and even higher now. I only buy on sale. $5 a box is my maximum as you only get 20.

makes great ice tea...hard to find in stores...happy Amazon has it...FYI...its an herbal tea level...water should be at a lower temperature in order for it to steep properly.

Great flavor, just leave the bag in for a stronger taste.  My new favorite chamomile tea.  Very soothing.

This tea is perfect for a long stressful day at work! You can taste the chamomile the most over all the other flavors. It is a very relaxing tea and it also helps with inflammation. Just dont drink if you are pregnant or planing on being pregnant because chamomile is well known to cool the reproductive organs and also causes early birth contractions.

Great tea for your lady! She’ll never forget you surprised her. Not easy to find in a retail location without paying way too much.

This tea is so good. It has a light, floral sweet taste. I steep mine for 7 minutes.

So delicous.

Use them for mid morning tea break

Didn't realize I was buying THREE boxes of my tea. Not complaining, so it's not a bad thing! Tea is absolutely delicious, and helps me fall asleep at night.

I usually buy this tea when I’m in London, I’m currently a seafarer & came across it on Amazon.It’s truly one of a kind, I feel so at peace when I drink this tea. I can’t explain the feeling. I’m obsessed with it. In love 😄

Great help to relieve stress...must try

Great Product

I purchased this flavor to try because I like the Triple Ginger version, and I add honey and lemon to that.  Thought why not get one with those two ingredients already added?  This doesn’t taste like it has either honey, lemon or even ginger in it.  The dominant flavor is licorice. I’ve been using it up by using one of the Triple Ginger in a big tea cup at the same time since I can’t waste food.  Will not repurchase.

I should have read the directions before purchasing this tea. I didn’t realize it has such a long steeping time.  Even with steeping at 15 min the flavor is very mild. I do not recommend. It says it has honey but I had to add honey and then lemon and and then ginger. So I realize I could just make this tea without the teabags…while I did read the description a little I expected some fancy teabag but it is just like other tea bags… my fault for being suckered by the flowery words.

Terrible. Smells like mold (everyone around ne agreed) and tastes bad. Arrived out of box because box was smashed, and tea arrived late.

I wish I read the reviews before buying this tea.  It was the second box I bought that was licorice forward.  So I went to the website to see if that was the case with all of their teas; and with the exception of 3 of their teas, all of them have a high licorice root content.  You can smell it as soon as you open the packet.  It's misleading to advertise their teas without putting licorice in the description.  So disappointing.

I bought this assuming it would be a lemon ginger tea, you know, like it says on the package. Brewed the first cup only to find out it tastes a little of ginger and mostly of licorice. Lemon was no where to be found. It's probably a fine tea if you like licorice, but as a  lemon ginger tea it's completely awful.

Taste bad

purchased in store at whole foods for nearly $6 and didn’t take the time to read the label which was a mistake. there’s no honey in this tea, only “honey flavour,” which is a waste of money and false advertising. the flavour profile itself is weak. you’re better off steeping dried ginger with lemon zest and adding honey to it. will never purchase again.

Maybe my taste buds are out of whack, but it was tasteless to me.  Wasn't it supposed to have some honey in it?

I was really excited but I think that I would like for it to be sweeter or it could not be sweet and have more ginger or it could have a more lemon flavor. It is so well balanced in the three flavors that it just tastes like it's lacking. It did help sooth the tickle I had in my throat but I don't think I will buy again.

the herbal teas arrived with the boxes broken half open the sachets all crushed and in two packs Two filters were missing there were 18 instead of 20

Love this tea hot or iced

This tea reminds me of an old medicine bomb recipe for illness. This tea is delicious with great natural flavor and fullness. I would repurchase in a heartbeat.

Great flavor and health benefits in 1!

It’s good but not for me. The honey comes through I just wanted more ginger

Been drinking different teas to get off of sodas. I found this one to have a nice favor. It made me want to order more from this brand. Give it a try and you might just find your new favorite.

If you are not used to ginger teas this might be a good way to try them out. They ginger flavor is not that strong, and the combination tastes great. Add a little honey and you will enjoy a nice cup of tea.

I bought this tea when it was on sale thinking of testing it.. I have tried several organic ginger teas in the past and this is by far better than any I have used..Love the flavor and also the taste.. Great combination of ingredients.

I like that it has a very good flavor I didn't even have to add sugar.  The manuka honey gives it a nice touch.  Very good but I think it's a bit pricey.

I routinely buy and drink this brand of tea, so I’m very familiar with how it smells and tastes.  All of the tea bags in this set had an odd “off” bitter/sour smell.  Additionally, the brand tags on the the teabags had a different color and font (this could just be new branding) compared to the tea bags I already had at home.  Finally, I opened them up and compared the tea inside.  The tea in this set was finely ground and lighter in color.  The tea in the bags I already had was darker and had a thicker chopped appearance.  I don’t know what happened, but I wanted to put this warning out there so no one gets sick from drinking whatever is in these bags.  All I know is that it’s definitely NOT the normal Pukka tea I drink.

I received this today and upon opening it, I was assaulted by a vile, visceral, vomit inducing package of the most putrescent odor to ever violate my olfactory receptors. I haven't wanted to puke this badly since my 21st birthday. I've worked in kitchens while the grease traps are being cleaned, and that is a stench even morticians agree is worse than dead, rotting bodies, and I would gladly inhale that just to clear my nostrils of whatever was in this box. The stench is so undeniably virulent that it melted my brain and made me eloquent. I cannot stress enough just how horrible this product is. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep the contents of my stomach from rocketing out my face and spewing across the room like a scene from a movie about demonic possession. And I HATE wasting money, so I opened every individual flavour and gave them a whiff. Only one of them didn't make my stomach contract like I was hit by a linebacker. I adore tea almost as much as Uncle Iroh and was willing to try the one that didn't cause an immediate visceral reaction. That's how badly I wanted a cup of tea right now. I took two sips. It was disgusting. I feel as if I've been poisoned and I'm running a fever. I've never ordered tea online before and I never will again. I only ordered this because there was a blizzard and the local shop was closed. The package was pretty.

Very disapointing. The product will expire in 10 days. Please, send a return label and refund me what i paid

We drink every different type and brand of herbal tea at our home. So when I found this lovely looking tea set, I was hoping to buy more for gifts. I use all of the different brands of teas that help relax and help sleep. I can eat almost anything and never have food or herbal allergies. But the first night when I tried the herbal tea in this set that is made to help sleep, I became violently ill within minutes of drinking it. I don't thorw up easily and have vomited about 6 times in half a century. But this tea had me exploding out of both ends with severe stomach pains. I could not get off of the toilet to vomit so while I was having explosive dairrhea, I was also projectile vomiting TEA and even the crackers I had eaten earlier in the day. I couldn't sleep for about 5 hours because of stomach pain and the explosions from either end. It was horrific! And then I noticed the name of the brand is PUKKA, and I am wondering if this is not some twisted joke by a psychopathic tea seller. I am seriously afraid to even try any of the other three tea sets I bought on Amazon, much less any more in this disgusting tea set.

I have tried six different flavors in this variety back thus far.  Not sure what the deal is, but they all taste of mushrooms and not much else.  I've tried single bags, doubling flavors up, etc.  They're all just weak tasting and not flavorful, at all.  I tried two bags together of the triple ginger and steeped covered for about seven minutes.  I could barely taste the ginger.  Right now I tried to drink the Love variety.  Just tastes bad.  On my way to dump it out.  I've heard good things about Pukka but I won't buy the brand again.

I received my purchase today and noticed that in the back of the box there is an expiration date of September of this year 2024. How am I suooose to finish all the tea bags in 2 months. I am super upset.

I was so excited about getting this tea and what a disappointment it turned out to be.

This was a gift, so no way to return. The packaging was nice and arrived quickly. However, it expires in under 2 mos. That is a short amount of time for 1 person to drink all this tea. Had I known, would not have ordered, or made sure was able to return without having the recipient do all the work. Would not have thought such a short time for the price, and not ideal when giving as a gift. The recipient who is a tea drinker, did not comment on taste, so feeling like it may be an over all flop.Disappointed

I have not taste the tea, however I did not know you can't return .....when I will give this to the people I was hoping to...they will have less than a month to consume it...what a waste

I didn't care for any of these teas and thought the flavors very weak. The package is beautiful though.

This tea is nothing like the Pukka in the store. It has no taste. The box has a Best By date that is different from the tea bags. Do not buy this. It’s also non refundable.

These are all so disgusting I threw them away I wasted my money on this they tasted so bad I should of returned but I don’t drive and I don’t leave my house and for ups to pick up from home is a fee I don’t know why it should be free with membership but I guess either way it’s by preference just cause I thought they were disgusting others might think they are great we all have different opinions and taste

These are the most tasteless teas I have ever had. Even the ginger (I used two bags in a large cup) just tastes like water. Seriously, I I’ll never buy this brand again. This feels like a cash grab.

The licorice tea scent is so strong that it has permeated all of the other tea packets and the boxes that it came in. It is a beautiful set, but ruined because of the overpowering licorice scent on everything.  Unfortunately,  this item is not eligible for return. Only purchase if you REALLY  like licorice tea and want it mixed with all of the other flavors.

I purchased this tea for my granddaughter for Christmas. I happened to ask her about it and she said it had ZERO flavor.  The product must have been old.  I was terribly disappointed. I will not purchase this product ever again

Box contained less teabags than advertised. Where I’m from, that’s called fraud.

This collection of teas is anything but delicious.I've tried hundreds of different teas, and this is one of the worst collections I've tasted.As soon as the box is opened, you are assaulted with the aroma of anise.  I like anise.  I put anisette in my coffee.  But too many of these bags have it in too great an amount.  Or licorice root.  8 of the 9 flavors have licorice root.  Too sweet.The Supreme Matcha Green has 2% matcha, the rest is green tea.  It's ok, probably the least terrible of the 9.I wanted caffeine-free good tasting teas, but I got this, yuck!

This is the first product that I have purchased from you that I am not satisfied with. I can’t even taste any favor to the teas. I have tried several of the teas and none had favor.

i purchased this as a Christmas gift but noticed that the expiration date is Feb1,2024.  That give the recipient only 1 month to use all the teas.  That does not seem right.  Very dissapointed I will look for a different brand.

I bought theses as a gift and the licorice was awful and when i used the green matcha it tastes like licorice. They seem old. I would not buyt again:(

All of the teas taste exactly the same, don't be fooled by the individual packaging. I refunded this, and the other two boxes of Pukka tea that I ordered. Bad brand.

I am sorry to say,This is not good at all! not only do you have to steep any of the teas for five minutes or more. even when you do that it tastes weak and not like a normal tea should. don't get this tea brand. Not worth it.  I usually like any kind of tea but there is just something about this brand. No matter what flavor you try it tastes just of hot water with  hardly a hint of whatever flavor you put!

I just received my package and the tea expires in one month!  Very dissappointed!

This tea gift box cannot be given as a gift, because it expires in less than 3 months.  It is irresponsible to ship near-expired products.

They sent me the gift box and it’s very pretty. Check dor the expiration dat because mine was expiring in a month. Returned.

The teas have no flavor, are very weak, in-fact you can steep for 30 minutes and still no flavor at all, the color stay very light, even multiple tea bags at once marginally improve flavor/strength. Its obvious that the teas have been sitting in a warehouse forever. even when you open the individual packages, there is no scent at all.

For the price, I was expecting bright aromas and flavors. It tastes mostly refill of wood and the flavors scape as very little original flavors

It expires in February 2024.  I don’t want to give as a gift that is almost expired

Almost every one has licorice. It makes the box smell awful.  I had to throw it away. I wish they would have made that more obvious. If you like licorice,  then go for it. But ew.

I was super excited to get this tea! I’ve become a tea girl as of late ! I am going to be honest , it was a huge let down,  no taste at all! I was so disappointed thinking I’d have all this great tea and bam ! Any idea as to why ? Any suggestions on a good brand that is similar w different teas ?

All the teas taste the same which is not a very good taste, so disappointing

I don't know what is in this tea, but it has no aroma and no taste. Three ginger should taste like ginger, but it and the other varieties I have tried from the box all taste like the box. Directions say to steep for 15 minutes, but even after 15 minutes there is no color and no aroma and no taste.

There are only 4 flavors and about 20 tea bags included in my order.

I don't mind licorice root but most of teas are pretty bland and disappointing. Not really a good variety for different flavors and other brands have better flavor. Not really a good deal either considering it's almost double price of yogi or other better brands at store.

Soon as I opened the box, licorice smell is overpowering. Now all the teas smell like licorice. Can’t return it since within 30 days. Don’t buy if you don’t like licorice!

Disappointed with this purchase. The bags are cheaply made so the tea gets all over the place

Rancid horrible cheap tea which went directly into the bin before it nauseated everyone in the house

This assorted tea box is overpowered by licorice.

Three people in my home drink hot tea, most of these flavors were disliked by all

I am disappointed this package arrived without a kosher certification even though it has kosher in its description online. When I tried to return I saw that it is non refundable.

These were just terrible tasting. Nothing soothing about this cup of teas. I dont know whT yo do with all these bad flavors

Everything tastes the same

Tastes quite watery despite the aromatic smell upon opening the box :(

I wanted so bad to like the these teas. They have horrible aftertaste and all taste like licorice.

Pretty but terrible flavor

stay away sorry to say

I don’t like it

They all taste the same. Licorice! Yuk

It takes a long time to steep but even then it’s not very good. Sorry.

I red a few reviews and the rave reviews were inspiring and I love tea! I was so excited opening the box and seeing the beautiful tea selection! The only reservation I had was that there was an overpowering sent of black licorice and I am not a fan but I noticed that there was a pack that said peppermint licorice and I was thinking that was what I was smelling. I grabbed the elderberry pomegranate flavor and tasted it and all I can taste is the black licorice. If you like that flavor it's a dream come true but this is stuff of my nightmares. The packaging is beautiful though!

As a hot beverage lover, the variety of flavors "teas" offer are a delight. I purchased this for the variety of flavors. The packaging is a nicely decorated pressed paper box with 9 different slots for each tea wrapped in paper for protection. Pleasing to the eye, and "eco-friendly", you might think this would make a great gift, but sadly, with there being no sealable barrier between each flavor, the licorice, annis and fennel takes over all the other teas...My daughter says she buys Pukka in individual flavor packs and really enjoys their teas, but I really can't recommend the variety pack as I really don't taste a variety...

Tea is great and high quality. Bad part is evey single one smells and slightly tasted like anise/licorice. The packaging does not protect the tea bags and all the choices tasted somewhat similar. Would buy again if the packaging was better.

I love Pukka tea, but so unhappy that the "best by" date for this tea delivered today, December 29, 2023 is on Febrary 17, 2024. How am I going to use 45 teabags in a few weeks? One of the two boxes I got was for a gift. Embrarrassing and disappointing. Tea bags should be good for at least a year.

I was excited to get this, until I opened it. The entire group of tea, all smell like peppermint, licorice, ginger, and turmeric. I tried the one labeled love, which is supposed to be chamomile and lavender. You can’t even taste it because of all of the scent and flavor crossover from the other stronger flavored teas.

Pukka is one of my favorite tea brands, can’t recommend the tea enough. But the package came opened and with teabags missing. There is not an option for a replacement from this seller.

I wish that these teas didn't all have licorice root in them, because it overpowered the flavor of the other ingredients.

We've tried most of the sample set that I got my mother as a gift.  The box and packaging look great, but the descriptions don't seem to match with the taste and smell.  Maybe they need to come with a manual bag set and the spices unground so they maintain freshness.  Fresh ground cardamom, ginger or fennel normally generate rich flavors that do not match the flavors these teas generate.  It is a little suspicious all the packets say 5-15min and 100C, maybe a lower brew temperature or more precise brew time could help.

Nice packaging, but the quality of the herbs in the sachets was very poor - little/no flavor.

Purchased this wonderful collection of tea on the Black Friday special. Received quickly however the expiration date is February 2024, so I have a little over 2 months to use 45 sachets of tea...disappointing.

I am sad these weren't better.  The packaging looks nice and the flavors sounded good but they aren't.  Mediocre at best and the bags themselves are poorly made.  They often break in the cup which ruins the tea.  Flavors are weak and not very good.  The green tea described as 'matcha' is anything but matcha.  It's a stale flat roasted green tea with little flavor.

I was disappointed by how weak the tea is. I had to seep it for 10 minutes to get much taste. I frequently buy high-quality, organic herbal teas, and all of them are much stronger than this one.

This is great tea, but we received it 7/18 and the best buy date is 9/30. I feel like you’re dumping old Tea and the price wasn’t that great for something that was going to be considered old so fast.

Weak. Very little flavor....even after steeping covered for 15 minutes.I like the box & am using it as storage for my incense 🤷‍♀️

The variety of the teas is nice except that they seem old and light on flavor.... had to add 2 bags to one cup just to get the flavor I wanted

Not great tasting. But pretty packaging.

...and I DON'T like licorice at all. Only two of the teas have non-aniseed, licorice or licorice root ingredients. The whole box smells like it.Pretty packaging, and, as I said...if you like licorice flavor--you'll LOVE it!

While this may be a great product for some, I don’t care for the flavors, thus far. I will continue to try the different flavors and may change my rating. So far, I have tried Night time and Turmeric Glow. It did arrive in a timely manner.

For sure a large variety, they all taste the same. Every single tea contains licorice root which overpowers every other flavor that’s in the teas. If you don’t like licorice root then I would not recommend this at all. Beautiful packaging though.

Every tea except for one has licorice root.  Had I known every tea tastes like licorice I never would have purchased this.

The flavor was very underwhelming. I really enjoy tea, & there seemed to be more thought put in the packaging than the flavor.

I thought these would be strong because of the price.  They aren't.  Waist

Looked great but the licorice tea permeated everything in the box and they all taste like licorice now.

I love the tea however everything in the box smells and tastes like licorice it's pretty overpowering

Every tea has anise, it’s yummy but in every single blend? It was to much.

My husband and I are avid coffee and tea drinkers, so I really looked forward to receiving this gift box for ourselves as a little luxury. It's a nice collection, but the teas do not adequately sit in their slots and that throws off the presentation of this gift. If I were giving this as a gift, I would tie each set with ribbon to help them sit better before giving them, otherwise they go all over the place.It should be noted that there are only 5 kinds of tea and they are not equally sorted in the box.10x Turmeric Glow10x Elderberry & Echinacea10x Three Ginger10x Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey5x BlackcurrantI was supposed to get, according to the Organic Listing, "Supreme Matcha Green - Turmeric Glow - Peppermint & Licorice - Detox - Elderberry & Echinacea - Three Ginger - Love - Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey - Night Time". I would not have gotten this if I had known the teas were going to be different than what was listed. "An assorted collection gift set of individually wrapped specialty Pukka teabags, nine different varieties mixed in one box" - this was not the case with my box whatsoever.I give this two stars for the tea flavor discrepancy is not the same as advertised and the fact that there are 9 slots and rather than have a nice assortment of 9 teas, there's a a mismatched number of the amount of flavors.

Feel so bad for my friend that waisted money on 2 boxes of this stuff!  For starters....companies should make it clear if a tea has caffeine or not, after googling (which apparently many, many others had to also) found out the majority of their teas are caffeine free.  I love trying different teas...but....these all smell so gross I was only able to force myself to try two of them, and they were disgusting, one sip I shuddered and poured them out!  Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did not try them all.

There's a time and a place for licorice tea. That's fine.Every flavor tastes like licorice.If you're going to sell me a fat box of licorice flavored tea, just be honest about it. Don't try to be sneaky. It's licorice; I will find out.

hardly any flavor and expensive as a collection. and you can't return this items

The taste was too mild. It barely had any taste at all

The product description does not say the date of expiration.  I buy this product because I love the teas.  The boxes I just received expire June 24 … almost a month from now.  That’s not enough time to drink all before expiration.  I am upset and can’t return.

Bought it 3/26/24 andthe best buy date was june 23 2024. I feel it was too close to the purchase date. Also it would have been nice if the item was shrink wrapped to preserve the tea.

Can't recommend this tea.I had to use two tea bags when I make a cup.The flavor is good but these bags produce very weak tea, like mildly flavored water.

I had previously ordered these tea boxes for myself and fell in love with them. The tea itself is wonderful. However, this recent time I had ordered 2 gift boxes to give for Valentine's Day. Delivered 1/20. Expiration dates are for 2/15 and 4/06.

Unlike a lot of people, I really enjoy the taste of licorice. Licorice candy is a favorite of mine. I enjoyed the taste of all the teas I tried very much, even though almost every tea contains licorice root for whatever reason (I'd love to know why). However, today I was looking on the back of one of the packets with a higher percentage licorice root content and noticed a warning about not consuming it in excess if you have high blood pressure. I looked it up online, and apparently some chemicals in licorice root can cause a serious decrease in potassium levels which can cause dangerously high blood pressure for some people. The article cited an incident where someone was drinking two glasses of licorice extract tea per day and it caused dangerously high blood pressure requiring a hospital stay.Since I have naturally high blood pressure, I now feel like I shouldn't drink the ones in the pack containing licorice root, and unfortunately, that is most of them. I think including that warning on the main product description rather than the back of one of the 9 tea packets would have been helpful for people looking to this for flavorful and healthful beverages.

The different teas would have been wonderful but unfortunately all tasted like licorice. The licorice flavored tea should have been wrapped so all the tea didn't taste like licorice. Disappointed.

I love tea and this tea is not delicious at all. It tastes like gross medicine each one of them. Just gross.

I purchased as a Christmas gift. The smell of licorice is quite strong

Ok so I like the taste of black licorice but these were overwhelming. It’s all I could smell and taste. I imagine if I didn’t enjoy licorice, I wouldn’t like these. The packaging the arrived in was beautiful and could be stored just as they came which was nice. I probably wouldn’t order this again but I also was not upset with the value.

The packaging and assortment is great, but there is not much flavor at all.  Even if you steep the tea for 10-15 minutes it still only produces a very light taste.  If you like a light tea with not much flavor you will enjoy this selection.  Not for me.

It’s probably hard to believe, but I find most of these teas to taste the same. The overarching flavor is licorice/anise. I am not a fan; however, the box is cool. I used the box to make a gift and that turned out well.

I really like the Elderberry blend and the Lemon Ginger Honey is a really nice anytime of day blend. Others I didn’t try yet. Very disappointing that each time I opened a Blackcurrant Beauty that the bag stuck to the wrapper causing an explosion of tea the first time and unable to salvage any of the bags for this particular type.

I thought each individual tea bag was in a plastic type wrapper since they are all in the same box. Because they aren't the scents and flavors have mixed together. And I bought as a gift. I would not recommend.

Tea is super light. If you are an expert in tea! you probably won't like it.

I love all the name& flavors of the tea.but when I made them they all taste the same.but I did like all the cute name of them.

The packaging is beautiful!There is one flavor in the box that I was able to smell outside of the packaging. All of the other teas had a hint of the overwhelming flavor.

Other reviews state these all are heavy on the licorice and they are right. To me, they are all one note and taste very much the same, and I don't like  licorice.

Needed to double bag the tea to get the full flavor. Once I did that it was good. Wouldn’t order again tho

Missing the 5 turmeric gold.

I should’ve listened to all of the reviews. They all say the licorice smell/flavor is insanely strong and I ignored them but they were right. Every packet in here tastes the exact same bc they all have licorice in them. Good if you like licorice

I love the product! However, since licorice is in one of the flavors and they are packaged with other flavors, they ALL end up having a licorice taste.

Had I known it all tasted like black licorice I would've never have gotten it for that reason only... I wish it was flavored differently but everything else was good as far as freshness and the value

For people that have tried dieters teas know what i mean when I say there is a certain “after taste” to these.  Every one of them have that taste to them. It kills the flavor or what the tea is.

Having hot tea at night is nice, helps me fall asleep, but all of this tea tasted to much alike.

The packaging is wonderful, it makes a great impression. Unfortunately literally every single tea bag, save one (matcha), tastes like licorice. It’s pretty disappointing.

Some of the blends are not good to me.  Flavor was just okay.  Great package.

The flavor profiles of these teas tasted like they took random ingredients and mixed them together. Not great.

Most flavors are made with the same ingredients. They call taste almost the same.

Expensive

First of all it’s Fair Trade which is important to me. I received this as a Christmas gift and I was very happy. I especially enjoy a cup of tea each evening, it’s delicious and relaxing. I love the variety BUT whoever said each packet is marked if it’s caffeine free is WRONG. I threw away the pretty box and put the packets in my tea jar and the packets are not marked. It’s important especially when offering tea to a friend or if it’s in the evening. Big thumbs down so stars list for that

Pukka is good quality tea and I've tried some Pukka in the past. What I find is that they use a lot of licorice root in their blends (true with the blends in this set as well) which I find to be cloying. Licorice root can have health benefits so I don't object to the ingredient itself, but I personally am not a fan of the flavor.The teas in this set are not the teas from the current description. The blends are Turmeric Glow, Elderberry & Echinacea, Triple Ginger, Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey, and Blackcurrant Beauty. My favorites were "Elderberry & Echinacea" and "Blackcurrant Beauty". Although the bags say you can steep these up to 15 minutes, I prefer a shorter steeping time. For me the flavor becomes too much if I do a longer steep.The tea bags were scattered across the different sections instead of being one type to a section of the box. I felt like this was a bit sloppy for a product that is marketed as a gift. The box it came in was nice enough.Overall these are interested blends of tea but they fall short of the mark for me due to the licorice root in every blend + the presentation issues.

I've been slowly making my way through the large selection of tea flavors. The amount of flavors, and their varying taste profiles, really makes this box a collection of hits or misses. On the other hand, such a large variety will allow you to quickly zero in on likes or dislikes and then you can specifically order the flavors that tickle your fancy.Matcha, Three Ginger, and Ginger and Manuka Honey are the clear favorites.  Flavorful with no odd aftertastes, a touch of stevia brings them to life. 5/5If you love black licorice and/or peppermint (which I do), it is very flavorful 4.5/5Then things start to get a little murky and the rest are strong 3's except the tumeric and echinacia  which are 1/5s and tasted very bad.Rose petal is like drinking the smell of rose flowers. At first I didn't like it, but over the years I've found it makes a great mixing tea with other flavors especially strong black teas.Overall, the collection itself is a 3/5, but remember the strength of this collection is you get to sample *9* different blends and decide what works for you.

I am not a tea drinker, but my mother is. I ordered this set of Pukka teas to be given as one of my mother's Christmas gifts. Upon receiving and opening this box, I was instantly greeted with an aromatic herbal fragrance that was very pleasant to my senses. The bags of tea were kind of scattered out of their slots, but otherwise looked fine. Before giving this as a gift, I will have to maybe place a sheet of bubble wrap over the teas to keep them from shuffling around before she opens the box. There was a nice assortment of tea flavors, but I was expecting at least 9 different flavors for her. We instead got 5 flavors, none of which were listed in this ad, so that was a little off-putting, although of the 5 flavor teas we did get, most I know she likes and enjoys drinking anyways. It just would've been nice to get her some new flavors to try.The box itself is very pretty, nicely decorated with flowers and gold foil. Needs a little prep before you give it as a gift, but is otherwise ready to gift.

This review is for Pukka Herbs Tea Selection Luxury Gift Box, Collection of Organic, Herbal Teas, 45 Count. First the packaging on this is very nice and it is a nice tea set. My issue with this set is you are not getting the set in the description or photos. You will actually receive the Pukka Herbs Support Selection Gift Box, Collection of Organic Herbal Teas, 45 Count which is a completely different set that only includes 5 flavors: Lemon, Ginger and Manuka Honey - Turmeric Glow - Blackcurrant Beauty - Three Ginger. Other reviewers stated the same thing so this seems to be a error somewhere in the listing or shipping process. The teas I did receive were good but be aware that you are not getting what is being advertised in the listing.

The tea has special taste. We like different flavor the tea has. However, the paper attached to the tea bag will lose color if it got wet, which is nearly impossible to avoid because I need to pour hot water into the cup. When that small paper lost color, you better don't put it on countertop because it can dye the stone color into the color of the tea, (green, yellow, pink...)

This was a “just because” gift.  It was perfect. Great selection of teas. Beautiful packaging.

The box arrived intact and as pictured. I bought this as a gift and while ordering I decided to try them myself. I’m delighted with these. I just ordered a third one now as a gift for another friend. I’m a coffee drinker but have been drinking tea on the afternoons lately because these are all so delicious. I thought some might taste strong or overpowering but that is not the case. My favorite is the the licorice peppermint. It has a unique and yummy flavor.

I bought this for a Christmas gift for my boss and she loved it so much that I bought it again when all the tea was gone. I highly recommend it. It's a beautiful selection.

As it’s great product is good packaging for gift

While the presentation was amazing and the smell was great. A lot of the flavors taste similar to licorice unfortunately, but she loved it still.

No complaints.

I got the tea for the girls for Xmas. They love the teas. Excellent flavors! We'll be getting more

I love this tea box mix! I first received one as a gift and loved the flavors, so bought another after finishing it. The fact that I can leave the bags in my water longer and get a stronger flavor without that gross bitterness is perfect for me.

The media could not be loaded.
                



The tea is great! You have to make sure it ships in Amazon packaging. It defaults to 'ship in manufacturing packaging' and it really shouldn't. The shipping stickers were all over the decorative tea box. Extra crappy if it's a gift. I managed to peel most of the stickers off, but it's a bummer.

I am not a tea guy, but my friend is. Got it for his birthday and he loved it. Told me all the flavors were good and a nice variety.

This was purchased as a gift so I really can’t review all flavors but the person said she liked it very much. In reference to appearance as a gift… the packaging was nice looking. I paired this with a tea bag holder and tea cup and it made a perfect gift (for a tea lover that likes to experiment with different flavors).

I really like pukka tea.They are good tasting and relaxing.

It tastes great

Package was beautiful, tea is high quality, my only problem was not knowing that nearly all the flavors I got had licorice in them, and I am not a fan, but that's on me. Great product!

cute packaging and nice variety. however, the whole box smells like licorice, and every flavor of tea tastes the same- like licorice. i’m disappointed. i’ve had pukka brand tea before but never experienced this!

Delicious teas for any time of day!  The box is pretty enough to leave out for company.  The variety of flavors means there's something for everyone to enjoy.

Didn't love them all, but definitely found some favorites. Packaging is very pretty, beautifully colored.

Different then what I was thinking, taste is off from what I like, but good variety not a bad purchase just different

Taste Fresh and natural

Delicious. Nice variety

Got these as a mother's Day gift and my mom loved the different variety of tea. I will be purchasing again for myself to try out.

Purchased this box as a gift for someone. For the price it is super cute and the quantity seems fair. Recipient stated aroma is good. Yet to comment on steeping smoothness or flavor.

First of all, the box of teas I received is different from the one shown on Amazon page.  There are 5 assorted teas - Lemon Ginger, Blackcurrant Beauty, Elderberry & Echinacea, 3 Ginger, and Turmeric Glow.  45 packets in all but more of the Lemon Ginger, Turmeric Glow,  Elderberry & Echinacea, and 3 Ginger.  There were only five of Blackcurrant Beauty.The box is absolutely beautiful and gift-worthy.  All of the teas are good.  My favorite is Elderberry & Echinacea.  They are all organic.  Although, the box I got was not the one I expected, the teas are still being enjoyed, and I do like the different flavors.

I really like the box and the presentation of this tea seat, but I was disappointed to find that three of the flavors included turmeric (only one had it in the name) which I don't like. I tried one of the non turmeric flavors (the berry one that wasn't elderberry) and it tasted... interesting. Two other tea drinkers tried some of the teas and seemed somewhat happy, so I am giving it 4 stars instead of the 3 I wanted.

Beautiful tea selection. I loved the box too, keeps the tea fresh. Any idea who makes these tea boxes ?

Box is very nice & appealing, however soon as u open the box all the teas fall down out of its compartment. If they stood in place it would be better so took off a star for that. As for flavor not sure, i bought as a gift for someone.

Good taste, great value for the price.

I found a bag of pukka lemon ginger & manuka honey in my cabinet. I have a bunch of teas and I think the ole lady put it in there. So I'm trying it now! Which is why I'm here, to purchase some more. I like it!!! Very smooth!!! Nice scent!!!

Great for gift

These are so delish!

I loved everything and was excited when it arrived 😊I ordered the tea for my Dad as a surprise gift 😄

I bought for my daughter in law and she raved about how nice it was pkg. and how flavorful they were! Nice gift!

Excellent quality, packaging, etc.

This variety pack is perfect for every mood on different days. The quality and The Taste is amazing.

this is a staple in my home.  Can't live without it.

Overall this product come in excellent condition and packaged well. I did my research with this company. They did a really good job with this. Thank You

The pleasure begins with opening this beautiful box! I love herbal teas and was looking for a good selection  to treat my family and friends and this was a great choice.  The teas are so different that you won't be bored. I really enjoy this collection and my friends liked it too. It can be a great gift to a tea lover 😊

What a nice assortment of tea!  I'm normally not much of a tea fan, but I want to get out of the coffee habit.  I picked this because of the assortment, and as all are caffeine free.  I've only had one this far, but I am so excited!  It tastes wonderful and no chalky after taste!This would make a great Christmas gift for a tea lover or even for someone like me who hasn't previously had good tea experiences!Delivery was super fast, too!!

She loved the variety in flavor and color. This is a really nice gift for tea lovers.

I like the quality of this gift. Packaging is nice and colors are bright and comforting. The tea was enjoyed and tasted great.

I was first drawn to Pukka teas because the boxes are so pretty but the tea is even better.  Such fresh, varied flavors for an enjoyable cup of tea.  The gift box is so pretty and colorful. Makes a really nice gift.

I bought one for myself and also as a hostess gift for a friend. Box is very pretty and it is a nice presentation for guests to select a tea or for yourself.

I haven't tried all the tea flavors yet, but there is a wide selection. This box contains caffeine and caffeine free teas. I like that the individual wrapping can be recycled as well. The box did have a strong licorice smell, I haven't noticed the tea tasting all the same though.

Wonderful little gift at a good price. I have enjoyed Pukka Teas and this offer gives me a chance to try more varieties. Definitely a winner. Get one for someone you care for. Do it !

Purchased for my brother for Christmas and he was extremely happy. Turns out, it's a favorite brand of his which i didn't know. So it was a hit! Nice array of flavors and beautifully boxed.

All the flavors are soo good! Perfect home supply of flavors for guests!

I originally got the Advent calendar for my husband and he liked it so much we had to try more. These are good teas with clearly high-quality ingredients. There is a lot of fennel and licorice in many of their varieties, which we LOVE, but may not be as good for others. We've been quite impressed with this brand and will continue to purchase from them.

We enjoy it

I bought two gift boxes for gifts. I love this brand of tea! The selection is great in the box. The box it comes in is super nice too. Cant go wrong with these.

I love these and highly recommend!

everything arrived perfectly and pukka tea is awesome

When you get the box you can smell the teas before opening! When you brew, it taste great with many different types of sweetener, from honey to coconut sugar. When I drink these teas, with my health problems, I feel energized enough to fo several projects,  go out to shop and errands, or just park walk with my walker. When my stomach bothers me,  the ginger or turmeric help easy the pain or harsh gas. I have bought 3 different boxes, everyone delicious and helpful! My sister and her foreign husband likes them too!

Absolutely hands down the best tea ever , wonderful flavors!

The packaging was lovely and such a nice gift in the ai tee when we all love a cup of tea!

Beautifully packaged tea gift set. It comes with a good assortment of tea flavors in a beautiful box. Great price point!

I like all the honeys but with this assortment I can order what I like the most. Great variety pack/

I bought these for my mom as a just-because gift & she drank 3 a day until she ran out.I need to get her a subscription now!

I love the earthy, aromatic teas that Pukka Teas puts together - it makes you feel warm and relaxed. This herbal tea sampler is a great selection of some of the different teas that they create. So far, I've fallen in love with every flavor I've tried, except one (as much as I love tea, there's always that one or two flavors from a brand that I'm not particularly fond of). Also, these samplers come in beautiful boxes that are great for gifting!

Great Christmas present had all the different kinds she loved

This is a good assortment of very good tea. Add Honey sticks to make a great gift!

I bought this for my mom as part of her birthday gift. She loves tea and is enjoying the variety of teas in this gift box.

I loved everything about this box.  A very nice gift for yourself or to give.  The tea was a very good assortment.  I really felt this box was put together well.  And it gives you a chance to taste to see which ones you enjoy more.  I am getting another box with different teas.

I have enjoyed every flavor except Matcha. (Just a personal preference, other people may love it.) All the others tasted rich and flavorful to me. My favorite so far has been to mix tumeric with three ginger. It is a wonderful way to end the day!

Good tea

I bought these twice before once was just to try them the second time was for my daughter’s baby shower it was a big hit. It’s also nice to have these in case you have guests… I’ve narrowed it down to a few flavors that I like extremely well, do not be afraid of some of the licorice combinations I definitely do not like licorice So the one that’s actually labeled as a licorice I stay away from however it’s in a few of the others and I can’t even taste it.

This company makes great teas. The package is beautiful and worthy of gifting.

This is a beautiful box with wonderfully flavored tea. I have not tried all the different flavors of tea but the ones that I have are very tasty. The tea is very fresh. The longer you let it steep the more full flavored it becomes.This box of tea has made me very happy!! This would make a beautiful gift for a tea lover.

I love these teas and bought multiple sets as Christmas gifts!

Very tasty. I drink these alot now

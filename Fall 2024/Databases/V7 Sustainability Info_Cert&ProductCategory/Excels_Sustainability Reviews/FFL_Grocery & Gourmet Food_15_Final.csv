This five pounds of loose tea is sold for only $.47 an ounce. The cheapest green tea from china sells for $.60, not organic not Fair Trade which makes this tea an excellent healthy option in USDA organic form. Guayusa has a smoother taste than Yerba Mate. Any food item sold directly by Amazon, not a third party means fresh due to high turn over. This is an excellent price especially when competition sells this tea for $9 in a 8oz bag.The first people to discover Yerba Mate were the Guarani (pronounced wa-ra-nee). Their traditional homeland in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil overlaps the home range of wild yerba mate. I was born in a tea family. I drink over ten cups of tea every single day. I have been doing that for decades and decades. USDA organic, a certified USDA, Kosher, Fair Trade. Those three items ORGANIC, KOSHER, FAIR TRADE, guarantee a superior product, fair treatment of workers and environment. I drink many different teas and even the cheapest USDA organic, Kosher but not Fair Trade tea like Davidson's green tea sells for $10 a pound and once again not a Fair Trade ingredient. Amazon has great pricing. To get the most out of my tea, I do not treat these teas like I do with the real expensive teas since I drink so many cups of it every single day. Instead I make these teas in coffee percolator since I like my tea really hot and I hate waste. Percolator get all its colors out but I treat the black tea differently.A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle -- this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling.Remember it is only a tea, there is no antioxidants, no youth, no energy, no nutritious stimulants except caffeine which is natural ingredient and all other miracles claimed by all those producers of Yerba Mate especially WEIGHT LOSS are all marketing tools. The only weight loss that I know of is exercise and cutting calories consumption unless one is truly genetically or chronically sick. These producers need to remove those claims since it is very misleading. Antioxidants are the most misused word in health and diet. There is not even a measurement of such ingredient called antioxidant in any food NUTRITION FACT table. It is a tea not a supplement either. I do not consume prescriptions for any chronic condition, supplements, pills, process foods. Only in US with relaxed laws these producers are allowed such marketing. I drink coffee as well as many black teas and none are supplements either except sugar free drinks. These are five star teas. Support those farmers through Fair trade or Fair for Life, certified programs and get yourself a nature given drink just like other plants that I use as tea when infact others only use as a food ingredient in their cooking but ignore the marketing.",2,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Try a smaller count option first if you want to get some mate (you don't want to get stuck with 74 bags of something you hate). If you love mate and don't do loose leaf, this is a great option.For people just getting into mate, this is a great option because it is in bags and not loose leaf. Also good for having some mate at work or on the go because you don't have to have a little gourd stuffed with steaming hot water and a handful of mate with a bombilla.There are better tasting mates out there, but this is a very good option for the price and quantity. 75 bags!? You won't find many options out there with that many bags for this price. They are not individually wrapped, so you might get a little dust from the bag, but that's partly contributed to the lower cost since they don't have to package each little bag. Additionally, the tea bags are just that, tea bags. No strings or little tabs to lift the tea bag out. If you hate that, Guayaki makes individually wrapped tea bags with strings, they're just a little more expensive. Not much though, since Guayaki is the more affordable tea bag option for mate. If you're super serious about mate, loose leaf will always be the cheapest option. I've got a 500 gram bag of Rosamonte that I've been working on for the past 3-4 months at work (at ~3g per serving, that's ~167 servings, 30 servings a month, the bag will last just over 5 months).ProsPrice and quantity are greatTaste is goodBagged, not loose leafConsNo string or tab on the bagsNot individually wrappedNot the greatest mate known to man (but still good)",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It's actually related to holly.Second, it contains vitamins, minerals, and more antioxidants than green tea (contrary to one misguided reviewer on here claiming that yerba only yields caffeine, which is not even close to the truth.)Yerba mate contains caffeine, theophylline (vasodilator) and theobromine (found in chocolate), but most who drink it find they do not experience the jitters, acid stomach or other negative aspects of coffee or green tea, myself included.I have found that yerba acts as a natural asthma medication for me, keeping my lungs open and giving me an energetic boost without feeling hyper, sweaty or keeping me from sleeping. In fact, I often take yerba before bed to keep the lungs happy all night and sleep like a baby. I cannot consume coffee or any tea (black or green) after noon and sleep at all, not even one cup. So clearly yerba is a special herb.It brews well in tea bags, in a traditional gourd and bombilla setup or in a French press.  Apparently in South America, they have it cold and brewed in fruit juice and similar things for a refreshing summer beverage. I cannot wait to try that! I've made yerba overnight in the fridge, cold-brewed, and it was delicious. Strong, but not bitter at all.Just wanted to correct some misinformation on here and share some of the reasons why yerba mate has been a treasured part of my life for 3 decades and counting!Original Review:I was introduced to Guayaki Yerba Mate by a tenant of mine in Los Angeles. He used to chuck a few tea bags into his 1.5 liter water bottle, shake it up and sipped it throughout the day for energy and the lovely flavor. I tried it and have been a huge devotee ever since. I like it sweetened with a touch of liquid stevia and I brew mine quite strong (so strong, you cannot see through the water, lol) because I adore the rich, smokey flavor which only seems to deepen when you add a little sweetness. I also noticed that while I do feel a little energy lift from it, I never feel jittery nor has it ever disrupted my sleep when I drink it in the evening. It honestly seems to help my digestion as well, I feel like it kindles the digestive flames somehow, but that might just be my own experience.Wonderful flavor, unobtrusive energy and a healthy substitute for coffee or ""energy drinks"".",0,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I also purchased some Red Rooibos as well to compare the two. I have to say that while I did enjoy the Red Rooibos, it had that very distinct tea flavor, and just didn't quite hit the spot.The Yerba Mate came in a few days later, so yesterday was the first time I got to try it as a morning coffee substitute. While again, it's not going to taste like coffee, this stuff was much more like green tea, which isn't bad either, but definitely not like coffee.  I normally add a bit of heavy cream to my coffee, so I did that as well, and found I enjoyed it much more that way.Claims that the smaller amount of caffeine being enough (95mg in coffee vs 40mg in this product), held true for me, as well as the claim that it felt more like a consistent energy, rather than the hard hit that coffee can give, and then fades.Yesterday I had to get up at 5:30 am and drive 2 hours to get to a 4 hour conference. I then had to run a bunch of errands, followed by a 2 hour drive home. After 6 hours of sleep, things didn't seem promising. However, I found that I really wasn't very tired at all throughout the day, and it wasn't until around 3-4, after eating a solid meal, that I kind of started feeling the energy drain, but I was still pretty good all the way up to my evening exercises, after which, I just crashed, but it was 10 pm by then.So, given the initial trial run, I'd say the Yerba Mate IS a good substitute. Granted, it could be a whole fluke of a day, but for now, my opinion is that the taste is pleasant, and the slow and steady energy buzz is actually preferable to coffee. As far as claims of being a mild appetite suppressant, I haven't noticed that.Just a final heads up: a quick Google shows that there's a lot of pros and cons about Yerba Mate, including that it's better for you than coffee, with lots of vitamins and nutrients and anti inflammatory effects,  but also studies saying it can put you at a higher risk for some cancers if too much is ingested. I honestly haven't looked very far into it, but will be doing so once I'm done with this. Just so you know!UPDATE: Oct. 7, 2019 - Yerba Mate has consistently held up as a caffeine substitute for me. I now drink 2 tea bags added to 16 oz hot water and about 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream in the morning. My energy levels are comparable to coffee, and I'm usually not hungry till 11-12pm. I got this because it's not supposed to stain your teeth like coffee does, and I can say my teeth haven't stained any.",0,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

And that this could POTENTIALLY mean bad news for bones, teeth, and brain function.  I will leave you to do your own research on that, as I am generally NOT a worrier about such things (so I know how frustrating it is to hear yet another possible health risk.)  Still (obviously) I saw enough reason to be at least ""concerned"" at the levels of fluoride in black and green (and decaf) tea.  This led me to two new products: White Tea and Yerba Mate.Yerba Mate is a loose leaf traditional (south american) tea-like product that comes in many different forms.  And it doesn't have high concentration of fuoride in its leaves.  So, I tried it.I heard that it tastes ""grassy"" or like hay.  Some say it taste earthy.  To be sure, it doesn't taste like green or black tea (but more like green than like black).  It is unique.  I didn't find it ""grassy.""  I found it to have a pleasant, non-bitter taste.  Not like tea, as I said, but pleasant enough.I prepared it by putting it in my Mr. Coffee coffemaker.  FIrst batch tasted like coffee a bit.  I cleaned the coffee maker and tried again.  This time i got a pleasant brew.  I tried to make it STRONGER, the next time and I found no real difference.  So, I went back to normal brew.  It will look a little like green tea in looks, but it's unique taste was unmistakeable. I enjoyed it. My wife complained it had an odd taste.  However, my wife is self-proclaimed picky eater.  Even if she loves some recipe/item, then later finds out it has XYZ (whatever item she doesn't think she likes) then see will change her mind and never eat that food that she said that she loved.

I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green ""tea"" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland.

When my coffee consumption started to get out of hand, I was looking for an alternative that didn't leave me crashing in the afternoon. A friend suggested I try Yerba tea because it has been around for hundreds of years, is a natural source of caffeine, has digestive benefits, all without the afternoon crash.  At the time, I could only find Yerba tea in health food stores. Each time I ran out of a box (usually around 20 tea bags), I would have to trek to the store for more. I'm not a fan of the Yerba teas with added stevia, vanilla, or the ""smoked"" flavor. When I found this Guayaki brand on amazon, I thought 75 tea bags for $11 would certainly sacrifice flavor for cost. But I was wrong! I love the tea - and it has successfully kept me from returning to my coffee over-addiction :)  The tea steeps for about 5 minutes. I put the tea bag into my mug and use my Keurig machine for instant hot water. I like to add some honey, and occasionally some milk or cream. By itself, it can be a little strong on an empty stomach, but green tea is also too strong for me on an empty stomach. I never have that coffee crash, and my mind actually feels clearer than with coffee.I would highly recommend this Guayaki Yerba Mate tea - for the taste & for the money!

Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and ""on edge"" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in

Don't misunderstand though, it doesn't bring you up if you are sad.

This coconut oil is of very high quality and has given me amazing results. The health and strength of my hair has significantly improved, and notice a lot of new hair growth. The rest of my hair has grown quite noticeably. Even though I think this is a wonderful product, I didn't re-purchase because I found Nature's Way to be less expensive/same prince for twice the amount of product - and the oil is just as good, if not a little better.

I've bought coconut oil in plastic, which I hate, not only because plastic is destroying the planet but there is no way to get the last of the product out of a plastic jar.  I can put Dr. Bronner's coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds and melt the remaining oil and use it.  If I try that with plastic, the plastic meltws and folds up into a mess, and I'm afraid to eat the oil because of the plastic.  It's crazy though that those who use plastic, use an excellent cap that is totally unnecessary for a plastic bottle but it would be great if Dr. Bronners would use that kind of cap.  Bronners uses a cap that would work well on a plastic bottle but prevents the beautiful glass bottle they use from being a good storage container.  I ended up taking the cap used on plastic and replaced the cheap cap Bronner uses.  Bronner ought to use a cap with a seal inside the cap so it can be screwed down tight so the consumer can reuse the excellent glass bottle.  Maybe they could swap all their cheap caps to the plastic company and have the plastic company send them their excellent caps, which serve no function on a plastic bottle but would turn Bronner's glass bottles into excellent storage containers.",2,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 1, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": -1, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

I contacted Dr. Bronners about the brown discoloration as I have bought this item many times through the years, but hadn't seen the brown before. I received a very quick response and no further updates is good news, as if there does turn out to be evidenceof an issue after I open the jar, I'll update my review if Amazon Allows: ""Please rest assured that sediment is normal, and can sometimes be a golden yellow, or even brown color. Any virgin coconut oil that is made using a dry process, including Dr. Bronner’s,  has visible sediment in the oil as it comes from the expeller press. Each batch will vary, meaning some may have more sediment than others, and some may not have sediment at all. That sediment is usually filtered out in a multi-stage filter process. Since we air-dry the coconut flesh at temperatures around 220 C, some caramelization occurs during the drying and makes the sediment slightly brownish. When you taste it you’ll notice a slight caramel flavor. In the past we’ve occasionally had slippage of the very fine sediment through the filtration system. That’s what you see at the bottom of the jar. It’s similar to the kind of sediment you may see in a virgin olive oil, or other “native oils"" when you put them in the fridge. Also, gray translucent spots are also normal. These are natural occurring shadows that are present in Coconut Oil. Sometimes they also appear in a honeycomb pattern.""In any case, I've always been pleased with this product and love that the packaging is nontoxic and sustainable.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

He started using it at night as a moisturizer because the acne medication was drying out his skin. It has worked wonders for his skin! He said it is So soothing and the acne is gone! He was able to stop using the medication and just uses the coconut oil. Most people wouldn’t think of putting an oil on your face but Dr. Bronner’s unrefined is just that, unrefined and Full of nutrients. It may have some course pieces from time to time but that is because it is pure, no additives. My most recently  purchased jar is so smooth and melts into the skin like butter!

I haven't wanted to puke this badly since my 21st birthday. I've worked in kitchens while the grease traps are being cleaned, and that is a stench even morticians agree is worse than dead, rotting bodies, and I would gladly inhale that just to clear my nostrils of whatever was in this box. The stench is so undeniably virulent that it melted my brain and made me eloquent. I cannot stress enough just how horrible this product is. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep the contents of my stomach from rocketing out my face and spewing across the room like a scene from a movie about demonic possession. And I HATE wasting money, so I opened every individual flavour and gave them a whiff. Only one of them didn't make my stomach contract like I was hit by a linebacker. I adore tea almost as much as Uncle Iroh and was willing to try the one that didn't cause an immediate visceral reaction. That's how badly I wanted a cup of tea right now. I took two sips. It was disgusting. I feel as if I've been poisoned and I'm running a fever. I've never ordered tea online before and I never will again. I only ordered this because there was a blizzard and the local shop was closed.

So when I found this lovely looking tea set, I was hoping to buy more for gifts. I use all of the different brands of teas that help relax and help sleep. I can eat almost anything and never have food or herbal allergies. But the first night when I tried the herbal tea in this set that is made to help sleep, I became violently ill within minutes of drinking it. I don't thorw up easily and have vomited about 6 times in half a century. But this tea had me exploding out of both ends with severe stomach pains. I could not get off of the toilet to vomit so while I was having explosive dairrhea, I was also projectile vomiting TEA and even the crackers I had eaten earlier in the day. I couldn't sleep for about 5 hours because of stomach pain and the explosions from either end. It was horrific! And then I noticed the name of the brand is PUKKA, and I am wondering if this is not some twisted joke by a psychopathic tea seller.

What I find is that they use a lot of licorice root in their blends (true with the blends in this set as well) which I find to be cloying. Licorice root can have health benefits so I don't object to the ingredient itself, but I personally am not a fan of the flavor.The teas in this set are not the teas from the current description. The blends are Turmeric Glow, Elderberry & Echinacea, Triple Ginger, Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey, and Blackcurrant Beauty. My favorites were ""Elderberry & Echinacea"" and ""Blackcurrant Beauty"". Although the bags say you can steep these up to 15 minutes, I prefer a shorter steeping time. For me the flavor becomes too much if I do a longer steep.The tea bags were scattered across the different sections instead of being one type to a section of the box. I felt like this was a bit sloppy for a product that is marketed as a gift. The box it came in was nice enough.Overall these are interested blends of tea but they fall short of the mark for me due to the licorice root in every blend + the presentation issues.",0,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 0, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I really thought it was going to be great for my skin, however it left my skin extremely dry and the scent was horrible.

I do the no poo shampoo method and thought I'd give this bar a try. It made my hair stiff as a board. I put my hair in a clap and it stood straight up in the air. It never fully dried after 24 hours. I had to wash my hair 3 times to get it out and a bunch of hair fell out with it. I'm pretty sure that was glue. My other bar finally dissolved and I just used this bar yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately I'm just outside the window of return. Companies shouldn't be able to sell faulty items. Return window shouldn't exist for situations such as this. Costco does it, I'm quite sure Amazon can too.If you want glue in your hair then buy this product. I lost money, time, and hair.

Do not order this

Reminded me of paint thinner! No way I would bathe with it ! Threw it away.

I had ordered this soap from Amazon before. Never had a problem with the soap.  But oh my gosh.  The soap that I received was deplorable. It was broken into many pieces. And the aroma of the soap was very off putting.  It smelled nothing like the previous soaps that I received. I was not going to take a chance and use the soap.  Because of the condition that it was in and the way that it smelled. I'll probably purchase it elsewhere from now on. If I could give zero stars I would.

Had a super bad allergic reaction after using this soap. My entire body was red and extremely itchy.

Love this soap but it only let me buy 4 because there is a buying limit ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ridiculous

Smells like bug spray! I threw it away but I do like the other fragrances.

This soap has a bad smell that is hard to describe.  Suffice to say it‚Äôs not pleasant.  Average soap with bad smell.  Had high hopes for this and was disappointed.

I love Dr. Bronner's soap but this one is a miss. It smells like motor oil or the oil from the machines in tool and dye shop.

This soap has the weirdest smell, like creosote and carrots combined and it stung on certain lady parts, won‚Äôt be buying it again.

First time I ever bought soap and had to throw it away. Smells like bad chemicals.

Not a fan of the tea tree smell.

The smell is horrible.

Expensive small bar of soap which was no better than cheaper brands--not the greatest scent either

Despite all the great review, it wasn't right for my face. My breakouts open up when I use this product, and start to be really really dry. It feels so great on places where I don't any acne, but on places where I have acne... it hurts and burns!

The smell is Awful.. Didn't use disposed of the entire bar..

This did nothing for severe demodex

Purchased one bar as an experiment in helping to clear up some minor skin irritation. No sign of any benefit compared to my normal mild soap.

Great soap  - fragrance not good

The product is fine but I‚Äôve asked for deliveries at my front door and once again they put them at my side door! Please inform your delivery people to deliver to my front door

I have been looking forward to trying a soap as oppose to liquid form body washes. I have used the soap in the shower and I have to say that I am not impressed as it has left my skin feeling dry and my thighs are sticky together from the lack of hydration/oil in the bar. When using the soap it feels good and has a great lather, however, when washing off it leaves your skin not feeling so great.

This soap dried my hands out. I'm not overly fan needless to say.

Extremely strongly scented, which made it unusable, unfortunately.

I pretty much always used organic or natural based soaps and shampoos, change brands often with no problems. But after two days of using the soap my entire upper body broke out into what looked like shingles, rash or chicken pox with hundreds of little red micro dots and welts all over my upper body and arms where I tend to scrub the most, thank goodness I didn't use it on my face, I should have taken a picture! This has never happened to me before. I immediately stopped using the soap and threw it away, not sure what ingredient caused the reaction but it was the only change I had made in my daily routine. The breakout lasted for about two days and then I was left with extra dry sky for almost a week while recovering. Needless to say, it's been many weeks since I stopped using that soap and the symptoms or condition have not returned. Weird.

No soap has ever left me feeling itchy after using it until this one. After two showers trying it, and itching on my arms and legs each time, I switched to another soap. The smell also reminds me of WD-40, which I‚Äôm guessing is the Tea Tree Oil.

This was recommended as a good clean soap for a face. It made my skin worse and very dry. It is also very strong smelling so I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that. I wish it had worked. On the body it is fine but definitely not for faces.

First time I ever purchased a Dr Bonner product.  The soap is okay - I think it is overpriced for what it is.  What put me off is the one-world message on the label.  Seems like the late Dr Bonner is the founder of a weird cult.  I won't be spending any more money on these products.  I might be harmless, but i don't need or want to be evangelized with my fricking bath soap.

Not much more to say than that. Maybe if you like Tea Tree you will like this? Next time I go camping, this might keep the mosquitos away! Full discosure, this is great soap - as soap goes. The issue is NOT about product quality. I just know now, I dont like the scent of Tea Tree.  I am going to stick with Peppermint and some of the other Dr. Bronner's scents which are awesome. My wife's favorite was Earl Grey but they discontinued in the US.

It is way too expensive for what it is. There are better options for much less money.

Got it to use as hand soap and unfortunately it dries my hands out which I don‚Äôt like

Removes oil from skin.

Terrible "fragrance"

Decided to give this soap a try, there's very little scent or tingle that makes me think that there's very little tea tree oil/extract in the bar. I'm going back to the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree bar.

I haven‚Äôt actually tried the soap yet but straight out the amazon packaging it STINKS. And not a good kind of stink. I really do not like the smell of the tea tree oil. I‚Äôll update my review after I use it but for now I‚Äôm not a fan

I broke my face out

This soap left me feeling clean and my skin even felt smoother.  It has a pleasant minty scent.  I'm a man with strong odor.  This soap does not control odor as well as an antibacterial soap does for me.  After only using it a few times it‚Äôs down to where it‚Äôs not much more than a sliver.

While this is the best soap I've ever used it it also the stankiest. I mean it stanks. Obviously made for smelly hippies. The wifey said the rooster taste funny after being washed with this stanky soap.

Was excited to try this bar soap since I use the liquid version to clean my make-up brushes. Was disappointed. Skin felt dry after each use. Will not be buying again. üôÅ

Look, there are about a million rave reviews for this soap so perhaps my boyfriend and I are the only ones who experienced this. I should start by saying I love Dr. Bronners; I use their liquid lavendar soap for shampoo and handsoap and cleaning floors and their hair cream for hair care. This bar soap though was AWFUL. It made my hands sticky and dried them out for two days! I have normal (non-sensitive skin) but I thought it was just me, some strange reaction or something. So I asked my boyfriend to use it - he had the same problem. So, given its incredible reviews and the strength of the company it may just be an anomaly but I wanted to add my experience to the mix.

I decided that as I purchase so many things on Amazon, why not expand a bit and buy simple things like soap? I remember Dr. Bronner's famous Peppermint soap from many years ago...it's legendary..So I figured this soap would be great and ordered it.Well, it's ok...I mean it works...But I don't see anything special about it that justifies using it for this price..The smell is ok, not bad but nothing memorable either.In short, (and I know this review isn't as exciting as a good soap review should be) but I won't be ordering this again...and am happy with my Dove from CVS for less than 10% the price.

Dries skin

Nice scent upon opening soap, but when I started using it, I smelled a very uncomfortable odor (like animal fat).  Tossed it after first use.

Kinda Pricey! It's all natural which seems great. I have sensitive skin. After using this product for over 2 months, i feel like i'm getting a big increase in acne. It has alot of oils, that could be the cause.

Of course it's true that what doesn't work for one may work for the other but I purchased this product thinking it would help as I have papulopustular rosacea, however it has made it worse. I have used the product every day for the last 4 weeks to give it a chance and I tried to give the benefit of the doubt thinking my skin might be experiencing a "purge" but it's just not the right product for me. I did see a slight improvement in the first few days but  that soon ended.  It's just too harsh and drying. My skin feels like I have a dried face mask on that needs washing off after I've used it; very dry and tight. The dryness has caused oil production to go into overdrive to compensate and oily skin = spots.  Yes, I never thought a tea tree product would cause spots but it has. It's also caused me to have more papules and flakiness. I do think Dr Bronners soaps are worth it but if you have rosacea or generally sensitive skin, avoid the tea tree one. The two stars is because I thought 1 would be a bit too harsh considering it's just the wrong type for my skin.

The scent is ok, but really did absolutely nothing in regards to helping with itchy skin etc. So a lot of money for one bar of soap, which doesn't really work, but it as hard as a rock, so it doesn't break down like most soap, whether that's a good selling point!

Hated the smell of this one stopped using it after a week for that reason and wasn't seeing any noticeable results. Decent packaging though.

It was too harsh for my sensitive skin.  It made my skin dry and it made the itching worse.

This is not a multi purpose soap bar at all ! It‚Äôs body soap only. If you wash even short hair you end up with a tangled stiff dull dry mess.

Clean, pure and just plain healthy. It doesn't tighten the skin or leave a reside, nor smell. No unhealthy chemicals because it's natural. I only buy Dr Bronnors soap.

Classic old school no nonsense soap. Pure simple ingredients that deliver great results, even without scrubbing it dissolves grease & dirt under the finger nails. The fragrance is fresh and herbal medicinal. Tea tree oil is a potent astringent. The packaging design evokes a time of a turn of the 20th Century Pharmaceutical Drug Store, which I like, and goes with my aesthetics. If fads aren't your thing, and high quality is what matters, then try out this soap, probably the best for oily skin.

I'm not really sure what everybody's complaining about as far as the smell. It smells like tea tree. Like it's supposed to. This is a very good soap for the price. The antifungal properties that I'm looking for may not be fully present however I wouldn't condemn the soap as every soap from this brand I've ever bought has been quality. If you have oily skin and are prone to fungal rashes or breakouts. This is a very good daily soap to use.

Hello everyone!My acquaintance with Dr. Bronner's - Pure-Castile Bar Soap began with the fact that I was in search of a natural and safe soap for every day. I have sensitive skin, so it's important for me that there aren't a whole bunch of chemicals in the soap.Now about my experience: soap copes well with its immediate responsibilities. The foam forms quickly and easily, you do not need to lather for a long time. The fragrance is fresh and herbal, and unobtrusive.After washing, there is no feeling of tightness of the skin, neither on the face nor on the hands.In general, there is a feeling that this is a good old soap that our grandmothers used: no chemicals and flavors, natural ingredients, and even paper packaging.My opinion: an excellent solution for sensitive skin. I also recommend it to anyone who is looking for natural soap!

Smell reminded me of antique wood. It was nice, and not overpowering. I felt very refreshed and it was useful as a beard wash. Lasted about three weeks of daily use.Extremely foamy, which is nice, but I would use it with a soap saver as a good chunk of the bar would disappear as it dried.Best part is the natural ingredients, after it ran out I used another brand of bar soap, and the difference was noticeable; it felt like I was putting straight chemicals on my skin compared to Dr Bronners.

Great soap, no issues I‚Äôm not sure about their claims of all the things it does, but it was a nice clean, smelling soap. I‚Äôd buy it again if it was on sale.

Great natural soap & a little goes a long way. It did not irritate my sensitive skin & it has a subtle clean scent. Good value for the money

This soap cleanses your skin so well. I notice I had a few break outs on my face and within one use those particular areas began to dry up and disappear. My skin felt so smooth and clean without the tight feeling. I will say use at your own discretion but it's a Go Go Go for me!!!!

I originally bought this soap for camping and used it as shampoo, it worked so well, when my favorite shampoo discontinued the type i liked, i started using it as shampoo, and it works great for that as well.  It does have a strong smell, i suspect its the tea tree oil, but it works great for oily hair.

10/10 Recommend! This soap lathers really well and smells great!  Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft! I think it lasts an average amount of time for bar soap as well.

Can‚Äôt use it on my acne prone skin .

I really like this as a bar soap for body wash but please don‚Äôt use this on face or hair because the ph levels are way to high and will dry your hair and face out

I will not recommend this soap for anyone with sensitive skin, such as myself. The soap gave me a itchy rash. It is mostly likely the Tea Tree oil.

I was happy because the soap is actually made with high quality tea tree oil and not some cheap knockoff with less than 1% tea tree oil like most other soaps but the only thing I will say is make sure you don't leave the lather on too long especially if you have any sort of sensitive skin because it will definitely cause a skin irritation.But as I mentioned I would much rather purchase a bar like this because it's actually made with the ingredients listed and not 40 different harsh chemicals

I do not like the smell and it dissolved pretty quickly

I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for what I had been using.I can't use this to wash my face because it's too strong and irritates my eyes and it's also dying on the skin.

It an okay soap. I like the fact that it doesnt have sulfates in it. Normal soap was severely drying out my skin and inflaming patches of psoriasis on my arms and face. This stuff does make my skin not as dry and flaky but still rather dry, especially on my face. Course it is winter time and that could be playing into it, I will list an update as time goes by. So far its been two months that I have been using this. The psoriasis on my cheek has been inflamed though and I have had to rub lotion into my skin to calm it and the drying on my face (not a fan of lotions on my face for pores).

I bought this soap with the desire to help prevent upper arm and back acne due to the tea tree oil in the soap. I've found after 6 weeks that my body acne is a little better, but I'd say not as much as if I used 10% benzoyl peroxide body wash over the same period of time.The scent is pretty pleasant--you can smell the presence of the tea tree oil, but it's odor is mostly hidden. I don't know if I'll buy it again unless it's price comes down. I wouldn't depend on this soap solely to get rid of acne.

It's the scent that keeps me from rating higher. Since it's Tea Tree I expected a medicinal smell, which honestly, I'm OK with. However, underneath that initial medicinal scent is...well...my great-aunt's storm cellar...You know...musty, dank, smells like a cellar that you open maybe twice a year out of necessity. (No, that's not a joke about my great-aunt)Luckily, it does not leave that scent on the skin. In fact, I cannot detect any scent post use. So, if you can bear the dankness of a cold, wet cellar every morning, then it's probably fine. Personally, I'm not sure I can.

I don't know that I'd buy this again. It's a nice bar of soap, but is six times the price of a bar of Dove soap. I don't know that it's six times better than Dove or other soaps I've tried. I will say that the tea tree soap suds up very nicely and leaves my skin soft. I've been using it from my neck down for about 3 weeks. I bought it because I have very itchy, peeling, burning feet (athletes foot) and also feel itchy all over sometimes. I hoped this would bring some relief. No such luck yet.

Great

Smells like diesel. The bar doesn't last long either.

Dried my skin out and breakouts

Alergic reaction or something.  Can't use.  Hear it's great if you have no issues with it.

It's great, but over priced

Good help out on itch

I love tea tree oil soap, but do not like the soap to have an over powering odor of tea tree oil.  This soap has a very strong odor.  My husband can not stand the smell, so I am unable to use this soap.

I feel like it leaves a film on my skin. But the simple ingredients attracted me.

I don't get the hype. I found it no better than any other soap. There was no change in the condition of my skin with this. People said it is fantastic for other uses such as shaving, tried it once and never again!It smells great, it's nice to use, but I found no advantages over plain soap therefore I can't justify the price and won't buy again

I didnt use this item because I didn't like the smell but I gave it to my cousin who loves these kinds of things.

It was drying and made my skin feel weird but also made me feel very clean

Wish this was a clear glycerine bar, but it has that fresh, cottage scent of tea tree!Good for feet!

I like it but thought it was an exfoliating soap. Thought there would be some ‚Äògrip‚Äô. I don‚Äôt stink anymore.

Very good soap.  I only wish I could get it at a better price.

Didnt worked for my skin

Good soap but not much smell.

Bought to wash wound of horse was then told it couldn‚Äôt be used on a horse because one of the ingredients.

Only 4 stars since I haven‚Äôt used it yet but the aroma without even opening the package let‚Äôs me know that this soap is still good and fresh. Will be using soon.

Very refreshing and tingly. Only the menthol scent is a tad annoying.

I like the soap. I don't like that each 5 oz bar is $4.29, but $5.38 per bar ($64.59 per 12) if I buy 12 at a time! Buying in bulk is supposed to save on cost, right? Wrong here!! Moral of the story: only buy one at a time until more reasonably priced alternative comes around. You're not the only show in town, Dr. Bronner!!

One of my favorite product

I have had several bars of soap with tea tree oils in them, a top one being Paul Mitchell's. This one is way more hemp than tea tree when it comes to scent. Don't get me wrong. I like the feel of the soap, but the scent just smells a lot more earthy, herb like... than any of the others. It's not something I clothes my eyes and enjoy, but for the skin, it still feels nice. So take that as you will.

The soap itself was great - lathered well, moisturizing, lasted a while. But, even as someone who likes tea tree smell, this was INTENSE. I honestly only used this when I had no other options. Other Dr. Bronners soaps/scents seem more balanced.

Generally like it but it is a very strong tea tree oil scent. I‚Äôm only using  it on face  a few times a week as a switch off from my regular face soap and daily on hands .  Says it‚Äôs for entire body but that would be too much tea tree for me.  I don‚Äôt need any bathroom fragrance like Airwick  with this in my soap dish.  Maybe with time it will be less frgrant(?).

Feels pretty natural and un-chemically. Smells good, doesn't suds up as much (lack of chemicals) but overall good

Good lather tea tree soap. I would purchase again.

Love this kind of soap. This one is really strong. Got the tea tree to help clear up a few things.. lathers great.. will buy again. Prolly in another scent tho..

Fragrance 4/5 and feels good on the body.

This one leaves the quintessential tea tree burn.

Makes you feel extremely clean but not dry. Will reorder

I do like how it moisturizer my skin and doesn't cause me rashes. Wish it lasted longer

It's okay

It lathers good and so far I think it helps keep my skin soft. The only part I don‚Äôt like is the smell

This soap really cleans I mean really cleans. It gave me the squeaky clean sound. You know how when you wash a plate and rub your hand across it‚Ä¶.. yeah that sound. I gave it 4 stars because it‚Äôs a clean like no other but I don‚Äôt think skin should be dry afterwards. I cleaned all the natural oils from my skin.

I live in a hot, humid climate.  The last few years I keep getting heat rashes under my armpits and upper torso.  I've tried powders and prescriptions and other tea tree products.  This has helped reduce the rash greatly.

I enjoyed the liquid original mint version so i thought i would try this.Maybe the liquid version would smell better.The original mint is so refreshing and I expected this to be the same, an intense smell and refreshing  clean.It cleans, it‚Äôs non-drying. Skin feels good, but missed on the scent.Update: changed to 4 for resolving odor but still doesn‚Äôt  smell good.

The tea tree oil can be a little overwhelming for myself, but it doesn‚Äôt seem overly strong in general. Otherwise, the soap is incredibly invigorating and gives you that nice crisp clean refreshing feeling afterwards.

It's just a little too harsh/strong for my eczema-prone skin. The tea tree liquid soap is much gentler, in my experience. I wish they had a glycerin soap option - a translucent bar. This bar is off-white and opaque.

I really like this soap although I prefer the liquid. The bar does leave that soap resuide feeling, but you can get it off if you give a little more time. Your face is left smooth and soft. I use acne medications that make my skin more sensitive and dry, so this works great when I need something a little more gently than the liquid. Good buy for sure.

All in all, I'm pleased with this product but I'm not sure if this bar is going to be a good replacement for what I was using before.  It smells great and lathers particularly well.  My only qualm is that it's not particularly long lasting.  My wife and I seem to go through a bar of this a week whereas a Dove Bar lasts us a couple of weeks with the same rate of showering. In summary,  I think it's a good product, does what it says it should, but maybe doesn't last quite as long as I would have liked.

I love this soap. Makes me feel fresh and smells great if you like tea tree. It is a little  too much $$$ so i won't but it all the time but a few times a year i will. I'd recommend not using it every day as it drys my skin out if i do but i use this as my gym soap.

So far so good. I have curly hair and it came highly recommended.

I like the soap but I can only find my online so it's not something I use everyday

Works in cleaning your skin.

Strong scent but great soap. I clean my house with this scent so I thought body soap version would be ok. I was shocked at how much I didnt like it as a body soap. Still great cleaning aspects like all Dr. Bronners.

If you have  tend to break out on your face, this is a  must try.For me it cleans my pores gret! It is drying so try using every other day.  I would recommend it's use  if you have oily skin.

Cleans good  Kinda smelly

I think I'm mildly allergic to tea tree oil, but I still think this is great as a body wash. After using both, I prefer the liquid version because it lasted longer.

Good soap. Like all Dr Bronner's soaps. A bit expensive.

My husband uses this soap and it goes fast. I think the liquid is better. But my husband likes the bar

Kind of drying but does the job.

This was on sale at my local CVS a few weeks ago and I'd only ever heard good things about it, so I decided to get it. It was on sale for $3 each. I've struggled with mild to moderate acne on my face and since moving to Hawaii from Seattle, I've developed some body acne (back and chest). I love to use this soap for my body - especially those problem areas. It suds up SO well, which is one reason why I love this so much. I like to wash my body with this almost every day and every 2 days or so I'll use it in addition to my favorite exfoliating towelette (http://www.amazon.com/Salux-Nylon-Japanese-Beauty-Yellow/dp/B007IAE5WY/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) and I have to say, this routine has legitimately gotten rid of 95% of my body acne. I used to have some red zits primarily around my shoulders and now my shoulders are clear and I can finally wear tank tops and strapless dresses without feeling self-conscious. My chest has seen the same results. I've used salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide washes on my chest and back in hopes that they would get rid of acne but they didn't do s***. If anything, they really dried out my skin and made exacerbated the problem. So glad I found Dr. Bronner's. This is my new HG body soap!!!I've also use this as a face wash and sometimes shampoo. It works well and is non irritating (unless it gets in your eyes - holy hell). I previously used Dove on my face in the mornings to get rid of the ridiculous layer of oil that builds up over night, and I honestly still love Dove because it leaves my face feeling balanced and clean after I use it. Dr. Bronner's on my face works great (also removes makeup!) but it does leave a kind of weird residue feeling on my face after I rinse it off. However, when I dry off that feeling disappears. I still use it instead of Dove, though, because of the more natural ingredients. I highly recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin.

I have been a fan of Tom's of Maine products for years now. With so many additives and toxins in our products and our environment, I am very careful about what I put in my body and use for personal hygiene. The skin absorbs things we use just as our mouth and lungs do. Therefore, for some time now I have been using
Tom's of Maine Moisturizing Bar Daily, 4-Ounces Bars (Pack of 6)
.The last time I ordered Tom's of Maine on Amazon, I was referred to Dr. Bronner's Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile Soaps. I was impressed first by the ingredients and then by the positive reviews and thought to try a few varieties. The first one I used so far has been Tea Tree. I have taken three showers so far with it. I was concerned at first because it had a funky smell, like no other I have used in decades. It was sort of a medicine-like smell. I supposed I am very used to perfumed soap smells. Yet, I found it to be a rich, well lathering, long-lasting bar of soap. I am becoming used to the aroma, but the jury is still out on it (the reason for only 4-stars). I still have to try the Citrus Orange and the Almond that I bought. One thing for certain is that it leaves you with a refreshing feeling after each shower. Skin really feels clean and without any residue or the sense that a layer of something was left on it as a result from washing with the soap.

Exactly as advertised!

I wish the scent was stronger as I do enjoy the scent of tea tree in my grooming products.  (I also use tea tree head and shoulders for my hair, and a tea tree lotion on my face).Tea tree is naturally anti fungal and anti bacterial without being drying.  Great for preventative applications and soothing if there is already a bit of a 'problem' (like athletes foot, jock itch, and smelly heat rash under woman's breasts).  I can't recommend a better natural extract for summer heat and sports.  If there is a better/stronger soap I'd love to know, but for my needs right now this is working.  No heat rash yet this year!

good product, i use it everyday in the shower on my face and its lasted for months. Im skeptical of this as i have used other natural soaps for the same thing and they haven't lasted anywhere near as long so i wont be buying again.

It's a good soap, leaves you feeling squeaky clean. I haven't used it long enough to see any sink change results. They problem for me is the soap doesn't last very long. We had it a week with just my husband and I using it which isn't a very long life for soap. I would use it again but I can't justify spending so much on a bar of soap that last 1 week all the time.

Loved the smell and clean feeling from this soap but used it up fairly quickly and haven‚Äôt really totally missed the effects of it enough to go an purchase again. Would prob buy again one day due to how squeaky clean my skin felt

I was going through heavy stress that my back was breaking out at an alarming rate. I tried my facial cleanser, but didn't help. I bought Dr. Beginner's Tea Tree Bar and it works!Pro: Clear Body Acne in quickly, without dryness and itchy residue.Con: Costly and dissolves quicker than other soap bars.

The soap feels like heaven on my skin. I love it

I haven‚Äôt used yet. But have I tried other products from them. I know I will be pleased.

Too pricey

Gentle yet cleans great!

The best soap

My husband and I both love this soap.

Love that I didn‚Äôt have to buy 5 soaps which is why I bought it..It does what it supposed to do and that‚Äôs the reason why I bought it I was looking, especially for this.

My Favorite Of All Bronners.

One of the best soaps ever. Slide this bar in between your cheeks while you‚Äôre taking a shower and you are instantly living life to the fullest. Who could ask more?

Love all of Dr. Bronner's products!

Wonderful smell

Best soap ever.  Very strong.  Cleans well

I bought this to help with shave irritation. No matter the razor or cream I also seem to get it. The soap has really helped to soothe my skin and avoid that. It's great.

I have had athlete‚Äôs foot for a few weeks and started using this soap to wash my feet. I feel like it‚Äôs been really helping to clear it! I love that the ingredients don‚Äôt have any harmful chemicals in them. The soap came in paper packaging with no plastic too!

Better price than at local stores. Regular user of this soap and love how skin feels after use. Plus the tea tree ingredient is great for maintaining healthy skin.

I love this soap. I was glad to find it on amazon, as the tea tree oil scent doesn't seem to be as popular as the lavender or peppermint- but the scent is amazing! It's a woodsy sort of scent. The scent is like a woodsy version of body odor- in a good way. Arrived undamaged.

Real good product, highly recommended

I love Dr. Bronner products. I‚Äôve been using them for many years. No frills, no additives and you feel (and are) squeaky clean.I highly recommend!

I use this soap to clean my makeup brushes. I swirl them in the soap to remove all the dirt and grime, then rinse them off and run them through my makeup dryer. The soap does not itritate my sensitive skin. I love it!

Love this soap, not to fragrant. Smells very pleasant. Big fan of Dr. Bronner's.

I have been using this product for years, off and on, but have pretty much settled on using this all the time. I really like the non-intrusive light scent of the tea tree oil and the fact it contains all natural ingredients. The soap really leaves me feeling clean and without having any heavy scents that neither my Wife, nor I can seem to stand at this stage in our lives.

This soap makes my skin feel smooth. It doesn't irritate. It makes plenty of lather. This soap is a good product just like all the other Dr Bronner products that I have used.

Reminds me a little of incense. Not flowery, not fruity, but warm, bright, and earthy.  Lathers and rinses easily.

I can‚Äôt believe I just found this product it works amazing and removes the stains from my clothes.

I've been trying to quick many high-toxic chemicals products' for my body, and this soap is staying in my list of 'ongoing purchase' because it's made up very organic. I didn't have any allergic reaction, I shouldn't have though, when I used it. It felt like it was cleaning my body without any skin irritation afterwards. I chose the tea tree kind, and it smelled like it, but didn't leave the scent in my body. That was not a big deal for me though. The texture of the bar after a few days of use was not like the other soap products that easily disintegrate when they are left in repeatedly contact with water or wet surfaces. I would encourage you to do the switch.

Love Dr. Bronners, always have. Works perfectly, has a medium level scent but it‚Äôs bearable as someone who likes the smell of tea tree. Lathers for a squeaky clean feeling, but I‚Äôd moisturize after to be safe.

this is a really nice bar of soap it lathers well and leaves the skin feeling refreshed after  every wash i have bought several of these bars and plan to buy more in the future i would highly recommend these to others

this soap has lots of risk free ingredients in it.

Great product I have scalp condition and I feel like this helps it

This is mg favorite bar soap for sensitive skin. And the Amazon price is cheaper than target :) 10/10

Really loved this product,  and will continue to buy it . Love what the company stands for and how long they have been around.  If you're looking for all natural organic soap, look no further . And it's half the price as others ..

I was using a more expensive Gold Bar from melaleuca and thought I‚Äôd try this to save money. It‚Äôs 95% as good and 50% the price so I‚Äôm changing over. Nice clean smell and not drying to skin. Thanks

I like this as a hand soap. I take hand washing very seriously post-covid. This does not dry out my hands. Good lather, too. It makes my hands feel nice.

The works wonderful, good value for your money, smells nice, and doesn't dry your skin üíì

It has a light  tea tree scent, lathers well and is gentle.

I love Dr. Bronner's soaps, and this one may be the very best.  Outstanding quality and a strong tea tree scent.  Highly recommended.

The scent is not what I expected after reading other reviews. I love the tea tree scent, but not there! However, I used it 2x so far. First time I went to bed with wet hair and woke up and it was shiny, healthy looking. Second time I used my blowdryer, with no product at all. No styling brush (my hair is straight) and again shiny, healthy looking and thicker looking as well. Love the results...not the scent :)

I have been using this product for more than 20 years. It is the only soap I will ever use. Both the products and the company behind them are exceptional!

This is the 1st time I am writing a review.  This soap made me do it.  I was very impressed by it.  Normal soap leaves the skin dry, not this one.  The difference is normal soap being a Jugo and this soap is a Ferrari.  You feel clean, but not dry!  You can even use it as a shampoo.  I just go over my hair twice, it foams up incredibly, that's it.  Now the rest of the body.  I liked it so much that I - in the future - will not use shampoo and body wash anymore, but only this soap.  I already ordered 3 more.  Sounds funny, but I am looking forward to showering with this soap every day. This soap is a quality product!  Do I recommend it?  Hell, yessssss!  NOTE TO MANUFACTURER:  I will be happy to write another review for the lavender scented soap if sent.

I am a farmer I have animals and I from time to time get ringworm, animals naturally carry it so it‚Äôs normal for farmers , I treat my animals for it but then there are times like pitching the barn I‚Äôll attract a batch , that being said before I apply any medicine I need to be really clean , well this stuff did the trick , omg for the lather this bars going to last a long time , and yes it smells like medicine, the cure at this stage is more important than the smell. It‚Äôs all natural so I went ahead and washed my hair with it , I now have highlights I never knew I had . If you‚Äôre looking for a great clean strip down this is your go to ! I followed my shower with a nice shower oil ( I know guys ) but you should my skin doesn‚Äôt feel dry but better to be safe than scratching all day . I think it has a high melt point so getting a soap holder would do the trick . I‚Äôll be buying more of this in different flavors you can‚Äôt beat the clean !

I‚Äôve been using Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Peppermint soap since childhood, OVER 20 years‚Ä¶ HE WOULD BE PISSED TO SEE THAT THE QUALITY HAS DIMINISHED SO POORLY! There is barely any scent, it appears to be watered down, and this definitely will not last AT ALL.The color isn‚Äôt the same nor the thickness. I had a 32 oz bottle for almost 7 months! WHAT IS THIS!!! It would be of no effect to use as a cleaning agent! I hope this was just a bad batch! Returning immediately!!!!

After having used Dr Bonner‚Äôs bar soap for years, I opted to purchase what I believed was a liquid version when the bar soap was out of stock. It was until the first time I used it and inadvertently got some in one of my eyes in the shower that I learned otherwise.  Severe pain had me hunched over the sink and then back in the shower for the next 45 minutes flushing my eyes out.  LOOK FOR LITTLE WARNING amongst all the other useless text that covers every part of the label. Eyes still being uncomfortable the next day resulted in a trip to the ophthalmologist.  While he said he could see no evidence of damage, it still makes me wonder why anything marketed as face/body wash or safe to use on pets would be so potentially caustic to the eyes.

Based on reviews I was excited to get this soap and tried it out as soon as I got it in the mail.  Needless to say I was deeply disappointed with this product, more so than I could have imagined.The consistency is very liquidy and watery which was a surprise to me.  I wasn't expecting it to be thick and as creamy as what I normally use, but it was hard to tell the difference between this and water.  Consistency though was not so much a concern as when I washed with it.At first the smell was a bit strange, but then I realized that it smelled chemically and the closest thing I could equate it to was not peppermint but rather far more like vomit.  My hope at that point was to wash it off as soon as I got a lather.  I used this in my beard and my hair initially, and once rinsed out the texture left in my hair and beard was like i had just poured sticky machine oil residue to the touch in my hair.  I then grabbed my regular soap and had to wash out the residue.Throughout the day my skin has even felt warm almost burnt like its been chemically burned from just a minute of having the soap on the skin, and even though I used other soap to wash it out the faint smell of it is lingering throughout the day.  Now I can't wait to get home to scrub my hair and beard again to try to get that smell out.I must admit this is probably the worst shopping experience I have had with a product so far especially since i was excited to use it.  I bought 2 32 ounce bottles based on hope and they are both going in the trash.  I can only assume others must have a different expectation from this product or are used to natural soaps, or the product received was just different.  I wanted to make sure to post my experience though so others can see it.

The bottle is extremely tiny for the price and the soap is not lathering at all. Even when you add water and a foam bottle, it does not clean the skin throughly without you having to go back for multiple pumps which can be annoying as it is pricey for a little amount. I would not recommend this product.

My order came in two bottles one was half empty the other had very little in it the tops were loose and every thing leaked out 30.00 not even down the drain

Major burning sensation all over, didn't even mean to buy peppermint, no I want to just throw it away.

When I opened the box it was wrapped in a cellophane which I thought was good.  But when I took the cellophane off the bottle was all gooey and wet like it had a leak.  So I had to throw it away.  I can‚Äôt even return it because of the mess it was making! Very disappointed.And a waste of my money!

We love this product and use it every day for multiple purposes. I ordered a 2 pack but only received 1 bottle. I also wrote to the seller but they did not respond.

I have never dealt with any skin issues the way that I have since I‚Äôve used this soap. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but my skin is covered in these irritated rash patches. It is literally everywhere on my body and I am just at a lost of words. I originally liked this soap because the peppermint helps open up my nostrils since I deal with a consistent stuffy nose due to allergies but it is not worth it. Please do not buy this product. I‚Äôve read other reviews on how people have accidentally gotten it into their eye and it was a nightmare. Nothing boosting to be organic should cause reactions like these. This is my very first review on Amazon and I just had to make people beware. I‚Äôve since read other reviews of people getting similar reactions. I‚Äôve worked so hard to take care of my skin and I hate that this has happened.

First the product seal had been cut out. you can still see some of the seal around the edge. Second this does not smell like Dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint soap at all. It smells kind of like what you use to wash your dishes with a little bit of peppermint smell. It spilled during transit. I got some of the product on my hands while cleaning the liquid that was on the bottle I noticed a weird tingling feeling started going all throughout my body. But this is not how it would be with the real Dr. Bronner‚Äôs product.

Damaged package even wrapped in plastic. Still busting and leaking everywhere. So strong of a smell. Way to much. If you have asthma don't use this scent.

If you have allergies to formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasers then you're in trouble. This soap doesn't list it as an ingredient but it must have either a cross-contamination or something is going on because my allergy went through the roof after using it. I have a contact dermatitis to formaldehyde and shortly after starting to use it my hands got covered by the rash I am used to get when I touch products that have it. The unfortunate part is that there is no mention of formaldehyde in the ingredients.And by the time I got my act together to return it I missed the 30 days deadline and now I'm stuck with it. I will give it as a present to friends. A huge waste of money, for a product that sounds "all natural" and hypoallergenic and which in fact is hyperallergenic.If you don't have any allergies, you'll be fine. It does contain potassium hydroxide which is a harsh chemical but of course this is diluted given the other ingredients. Plus, it should also be used further diluted in water not as it is, concentrated.A complete disappointment.

Once again, a product ruined by hemp oil.The "peppermint" scent is really just a strong eucalyptus, at best, and wears off after drying, leaving you to reek of hemp. I asked about this specifically, before ordering the product, as I absolutely do not like the smell of hemp.Its claim to be moisturizing is a joke, it left my skin feeling like the plastic you stretch over furniture and itchy. Especially impressive, considering my skin is more oily than normal and naturally soft\smooth. However, the complaints that it's too intense on sensitive areas or your private bits seems overblown, at least to my male bits. It was certainly noticeable, but not nearly overwhelming.Another issue is that the soap itself is very thin, barely more viscous than water. Makes it hard to keep in your hand to lather up and use.Will be returning this product and not ordering from this brand again.

I purchased this item based on the ‚Äúlore‚Äù behind this product.  I even read a short blurb about it in Backpacker magazine.  I also wanted to reduce my footprint in the wilderness using a more environmentally friendly product.  In my opinion, the lore on this product is all hogwash.  In short, if you‚Äôre looking to use this to get anything clean, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.  I used this on an 85-mile backpack trip in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana.  I used it to clean my person, wash dishes and even to brush my teeth.  When used as a personal body wash, it doesn‚Äôt rinse off easily which can lead to dry skin and chaffing in sensitive areas when pulling down long day hikes.  I never felt clean after using this soap and had to use twice as much as other ‚Äúcamp‚Äù soaps.  After about 5 days (I was in the wilderness for 12 days) of using this soap to clean dishes, I reverted back to my old standby‚Ä¶river sand and small stones.  Even though I purchased the peppermint soap, it tasted like soap when used as toothpaste.  Let‚Äôs just say I was happy my trail partners brought along normal toothpaste.  When all is said and done, I have no idea how this soap has become so popular.  Don't waste your money on this crap.

When i received the package, both lids were broken. Thankful for sealed bottle or both would have drained.

I dont know what all the 5star review is for! Honestly I hesitate before negatively reviewing products. I bought this to reduce the number of plastic bottles I used,I thought since they add water anyway,I can do that home.But this is a nightmare. I used this on body, hair, handwash, here is my experiece. It dried out my hair and body.My hair felt like grass after washing in this. I followed instractions, squirt a little and apply. Used it on body to have the mint hit me so hard,I started shivering, feels that cold! Gave it a few tries just in case,but NO. Currently using it as handwash and I curse myself everytime I have to use it,because I don't like throwing my money away!Please don't buy.

This product I thought was the best. I used it every day for 11 months. First I used it to clean my face but quickly learned it burns if not diluted. It caused my face to peel. Not a big deal so I continued to use it. 6 months in my whole body starts to have rashes that stayed for weeks. I went to doctor and they gave me steroids to heal, and it did. A few months later I start to have rashes on my private parts and face. Same rash. Red inflamed skin. Once again I get meds to heal but now I am dropping this soap. The whole time during use of the product I looked blushed in the face because my skin was always irritated. Honestly I should sue.

I purchased this product as a two pack and it smelled sour when I got it like fish. I returned the item and the seller sent me another one which was also sour smelling like fish. I sent all of the items back at this point and Amazon says they received them but the refund has been pending since June.  I never received the refund!!

I LOVE this product - have used it for several years.  Ordered online recently for convenience.  While the shipping was fast, the 2 pack of 32 oz bottles arrived without ANY packing material, loose, in a small box.  BOTH of the lids were broken, and one of the bottles had slight leakage of product.  How hard it is to add a bit of cushioning to protect the product??  The product is great, but cannot recommend the vendor due to how they package the product.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I like Dr. Bonner's Peppermint Sugar Soap, so I thought I'd try the Hemp version. Waste of money. First, it's very thin and watery (see video). It feels diluted and squirts out at a wasteful high volume. Second, this soap hardens into a plug at the end of the pump. So guess what? You push the pump, and the soap sprays sideways, straight up or anywhere but into your hand. Very messy. I've learned to remove the hardened plug before each use. But sometimes I forget and have to wipe down the wall. Seriously? We've had liquid soaps for, what, decades?This version smells the same as the sugared product, but it's leaves skin feeling drier. A note on packaging: There must be 5000 words on the label, going both vertical and horizontal, all set in tiny, minuscule type rendering it illegible. One line reads: "Enjoy body rub to stimulate body-mind-soul-spirit and teach the Essence Moral ABC uniting all free in the shepherd-astronomer Israel's greatest All-One-God-Faith!" HUH?? This is the kind of silliness that makes me drop a brand. Dr. Bonner, go heal thyself!

Box arrived looked fine on outside, opened and one bottle had been damaged and was leaking.  The two bottles arrive shrink wrapped, the first was fine, the second bottke's cap was badly damaged with a large crack from one side, over the top to the other side.  The contents of the bottle filled the plastic wrap and was leaking into the box, very messy, leaked onto counter and floor.  I looked closely at the box, it does not appear to have any damage, it looks like this item was packaged at the warehouse damaged.  Amazon will not accept returns on this item. Basically I got one bottle for the price of two, very dissappointed.

First, I love the scent!  That said, it does not rinse off well.  After shampooing my hair, and rinsing for about 3 minutes, I still have residue in my hair.  I then have to re-wash the hair in a different shampoo to make it feel clean.  On my skin, although I like the tingle, I have to use soap to  get the skin feeling well-rinsed.  I don't dare use this on clothes or dishes or for cleaning, as I don't want a residue left where I used it.  I read where you should dilute this.  It has the consistency of water, anyway, so how much can it be diluted.  All-in-all, very disappointing.  Do not recommend it to ANYONE.

This is not the same as many years ago

This is horrendous! I refuse to believe this didn't look like this before it was packed. Besides the leakage of both bottles, I'm afraid that it could possibly burn my skin!

Had to throw out the bottles completely, looks like these bottles were thrown. Caps absolutely destroyed in pieces.

I am writing this review mainly about the price gouging going on with this seller. He charged me double the regular price for this soap. However it was more my fault because I did not look at the ounces. But I live and learn. I dont even want to leave my house to go to the post office to return it. I absolutely love this soap if you want to try it, I definitely recommend it especially with all the hand washing right now. It keeps your skin soft. Just dont buy it from this seller. God bless everyone stay safe!!!!!!!!

The product was damaged.  Poor quality control in packing.  Could not return due to leakage.  I gave a a one star, although the product is excellent.  I did get a full refund.  Strong Peppermint scent.  Strongly suggest that Amazon address these concerns to the vendor.  I have read the negative reviews and most concerns were broken caps and leakage.  Finally, I made a point to notify Amazon‚Äôs customer service directly.

I started using this soap and got a very itchy rash on my chest. Stopped using it for about a week and the rash was mostly gone. Tried the soap again last night and the rash is back but now covers my entire torso. Perhaps my skin is sensitive to peppermint oil but I am done experimenting with this soap. Wish I had never bought it.

Sorry to say this produce seem to be old and won't come out the bottle hole. I had to keep adding water to thin it out.

I have been using Dr. Bronners Hemp/Peppermint soap forever but always get it at the store.  This has a differnt label from what I get at store and has WAY too much peppermint oil so I will never us it on my skin again. Maybe to clean the counters.I guess people are right when they say don't buy things like this from amazon.

******DO NOT USE THIS - DANGEROUS*****  Splattered into my eye while washing hands.  Washed eye, showered, nothing helped. Called poison control, called nurse line, no solutions.  My husband decided to take me to the ER after 90 minutes.  We were there 7 hours.  Chemical burn on my retina.  Horrible pain, eye swollen closed and couldn't see for a week.  $4000 worth of ER and follow up bills.  Get a different soap!!!!

Box and one bottle were damaged. I thought, they aren‚Äôt taking returns, and it‚Äôs soap- so let‚Äôs try it. It doesn‚Äôt smell like the blue label soap, rather the smell is quite muted. And, while the soap lathers as normal, the skin feel (the blue label feels differently than some of the other labels) is also rather muted. In short, this neither felt nor smelled like Dr Bronners I‚Äôve used in the past.

Send products with care plz!!!Both caps are broken!!!

Don‚Äôt buy it. As another customer stated before it‚Äôs not real. This brand does not offer this soap in this size on their website or any other website (target etc.) it smells good and gives a nice cooling effect but it broke me out and I could not figure out what was causing the break out until I realized it would go away until the next time I used this soap. Beware

The product is great, but I will not buy from here again. The size is smaller and more expensive than you can get in Target or online somewhere else. I chose the 25 fl oz and when I ordered the price was $19.99. I‚Äôm writing this review about 4 days after it arrived and the price has decreased to around $18.I‚Äôve previously bought a 32 fl oz from Target for $15...order it elsewhere and get more for yourself bucks. I made the mistake of not realizing the size prior to ordering.

Caps came cracked in half, and no way to return or replace. VERY frustrating!

This is a great product, however the price is ridiculous I been buying this product since it was 15 now the price is almost triple soon an later we won‚Äôt be able to afford it. I have recommended this product both locally and internationally. Inconclusive I can‚Äôt recommend no more sorry üòû

Once I opened the package there was only one 32 oz bottle

So I'm rating this one star, because I can tell without a doubt this is definitely either diluted or old. I've had this soap before and the experience is quite noticeable. As in it lights you on fire in the shower. You can also very loudly smell peppermint, not with this one though.That all being said, it's oddly much more moisturizing than the one I usually buy. Maybe because it's diluted, but if you ever thought the original Bronners soap was too drying, you may like this better.

I've used Dr Bronner peppermint sent for a long time, but I previously bought it at local health food stores. The smell of this one from amazon is really off and gave me a headache.It also left a residue in my sink which I had to scrub with another home cleaner to get off. I'm not shocked other reviewers have noted that it doesn't rinse off well for their hair.Just buy it at the store. Amazon is overrun with fake products.

If you are a Christian or believer of Jesus Christ DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR SUPPORT this company. I have thrown this product away! There is an anti-Christ prayer or chant on the bottle that I think is decieving and disrespectful! Before I put my money into a cult, I would like to know first so that I can kindly declined. What would it profit a man to gain the whole world (beauty included) and lose his soul? This is sick and sad. Hope none else is deceived.

I'm not getting the five star reviews for this soap.  While the soap seems to lather okay, it is very, very thin and runny.  Once I put it in my dispenser, I was sprayed at least ten times before I learned to "cup" my hand around the spout before depressing it.  The smell is not unpleasant, but not very strong at all.  I'll finish using the bottles I ordered, but I would not order again.

First of all the taste is awful, plus since it doesn‚Äôt foam you end up using to much in order to feel clean.  I love the soap, but I‚Äôll pass on getting this product again.

I buy Dr. Bonner's ALL the time. I don't know what this stuff is. Both bottles came with no safety seal on the actual bottle. Also the lids are different than an actual Dr. Bonner's lid. Looks like Bonner's, smells like Bonner's, but who knows what it really is. I would not trust the product from this seller. No seal, no deal.

This is false advertising, says two 32 oz bottles and I have received one. I want another bottle or refund!

I found a larger size for a lower price. Surprised me cuz I have used this product for multi purposes for years. Pays to price check with other places.

I've used this for years.  This soap has NO Scent at All!  It also separates and burns my skin.  Unfortunately, I opened both bottles trying for figure out what was wrong.  Big Problem!  Big waste of money!

Please research company as i have thrown dr. Bronners product away, as christian i do not agree with companys one world religion belief. I wasnt aware until started reading the label and determined it does not align with my personal convictions.

Dries skin really bad and makes it feel tight and itchy. I have no known allergies, but I broke out in a bad rash after using it. It is the only change up in my day to day routine. Will be dumping mine down the drain.

Package arrived leaking all over my front step. I have been a huge fan of Dr Bronners products for years. It was very disappointing to have the product arrive with one of the bottles leaking with no apparent damage to the bottle.

Great quality leaves you feeling fresh not harsh on the skin at all it is all natural ingredients and the ONLY soap I would swear by. Super easy to use and has multiple different uses. Very effective and leaves you feeling clean fresh and renewed. Have used it for laundry and cleaning as well for a clean smell that is not too strong.

Being a devoted fan of Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap for a long time, especially the invigorating Peppermint variation, I can confidently declare that it has become an essential part of my household. The dedication to using high-quality ingredients is evident in every wash, as more than 70% of the soap is sourced from certified organic and fair trade suppliers. This not only ensures the well-being of my skin but also promotes ethical practices throughout the entire supply chain. I admire the conscious decision to use sustainably harvested palm kernel oil from Ecuador, which not only contributes to the soap's luxurious lather but also helps preserve local ecosystems. With no synthetic additives, this soap provides a pure and refreshing cleanse without compromising on environmental responsibility or skin health. Its concentrated formula goes beyond just handwashing, finding its way into my laundry, dishes, and even pet baths, showcasing its versatility and value. Moreover, the soap's eco-conscious packaging, made entirely from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic, makes every purchase feel like a small yet significant step towards a greener future. Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap is more than just a product; it represents the power of sustainable, ethical, and effective personal care.

I love the scent of this soap! It is very refreshing and the quality is remarkable! I plan to make it one of my many Subscribe & Save purchases.

I think it is awesome that this product is not only organic, but is also made with fair-trade ingredients. It is versatile, I‚Äôm using it for face wash and hand soap at the moment. It doesn‚Äôt dry your skin like typical soaps due to the lack of surfactants. I have really sensitive skin and it is gentle as ever! Highly recommend!

I remember this stuff from my childhood. I've heard it referred to as "hippy soap". I remember the "peppermint tingle". However, it wasn't until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own. I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place. There were quite a few items that needed to be investigated...I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG's Skin Deep. So I found body wash, soap, shampoo, dish rinse, laundry detergent, toothpaste...and then I found Dr. Bronners...one product to handle all those tasks. It sure made things easier!Just think about how all of those products are going on your skin at some point...and then being absorbed...multiple times a day, every day, for years...the bombardment of toxic chemicals is crazy and once you start thinking about it you realize how ridiculous our culture has become with no oversight whatsoever.Dr. Bronner's carries "Champion Status" at the Environmental Working Group's website that ranks products based on their danger/toxicity. This means they have signed a pledge to use only the safest ingredients in all their products. On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the safest), this product scores a 1. I think if you averaged the scores of all the products I have replaced with it, you'd get about a 5.I now buy it by the gallon and have just purchased my second one (3 months later). Do the math and I think my girlfriend and I will go through about 4 gallons a year with all the uses mentioned here.DILUTE DILUTE DILUTEBody Wash: The standard dilution here of about 20% soap to 80% water works fine. You can adjust to your liking/lather preferences. I had been using a Dial foaming hand soap in all my rooms and I've emptied those, cleaned them real good, and converted them to Dr. Bronner's foaming dispensers. I love the results. It foams up real good and the lather is good. If you want more, just up the strength (reduce dilution) a little bit. You may find this leaves a little "tingle" in certain spots that will be extra-noticeable with cold water/air - you may enjoy this or not...either way it's certainly not a big deal and you do get used to it. The other thing to get used to is that you won't have that slimy feeling on your skin that we've probably learned to associate with being clean. That's just the chemicals on your body...Hand Soap: Using the same dilution (20/80) and re-purposed foaming bottles, I keep this in all bathrooms as hand soap. Not much to say here and people compliment me on the smell of my soap...even if they wonder what the heck it is!Dish Rinse: Once again I go with about 20/80 in a squirt bottle in my kitchen. You'll be surprised how well it cleans. When you start seeing the bubbles/lather reduce, squirt a little more and keep going. Remember you're never going to get that insane never-ending foam/lather without the harsh chemicals, but you'll be surprised with how well it does on its own. I do find that if I wash something and don't rinse it off fairly quickly it leaves behind a little "oil slick" that is most noticeable on metallic items...but it's organic and safe...and if you just run your sponge over it real quick and rinse, it's gone. Not a problem at all.Floor Cleaner: Here I dilute it down to like 5% soap, 95% water. It doesn't leave any residue and cleans up nicely - the smell is good too...and it's nice to know I'm not just filling the air with chemical fragrances than can linger in my home for days.Shampoo: I keep some in a bottle at full strength and pour about a teaspoon in my hand, rub together a little, then put it in my hair and clean as usual...you probably need more if you don't have short guy hair like me. I might try to dilute this to 50% only because at full strength it likes to clog the little opening of the bottle with dried soap. It cleans my hair well and I follow it up with
Dr. Bronner - Organic Shikakai Conditioner Hair Rinse, 8 fl oz liquid
. My girlfriend's hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did and so I've switcher her over to Yes to Cucumbers (or Yes to Carrots) shampoo and conditioner which is great as well!Laundry Detergent: I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load. I adjust up or down depending on the size. I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap. At ~$50 per gallon this is more expensive than your typical Tide chemical gallon but once you factor in that you don't really need (or I don't, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large. If you wash with the chemicals you have them on your skin all day long...every time you sweat they're soaking into your skin...no thanks.Toothpaste: this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon. I like about 3 drops on my wet toothbrush. I know what you're thinking "eww, soap in my mouth?!" I'm not sure how the other scents would work but with peppermint, I had no problem with it. With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean. Brush as normal but one warning: don't take forever. Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long. I find that if I brush for about 1 minute it's not a problem at all. Two minutes and my mouth is a little burnt - but it's not the end of the world and heals overnight. This is why I am considering going with a 1:1 ratio of soap to water and using like 6-10 drops. UPDATE: I have been combining equal parts extra virgin coconut oil and baking soda + Dr. Bronner's (for the peppermint/cleaning) as a homemade toothpaste and it's working well!

I have been using this soap for decades. It is the best soap if you want to feel fresh and clean. The peppermint naturally opens up your pores and your sinuses. Great if you really wan to feel and smell fresh and clean.

A great liquid soap and body soap. The peppermint ascent is great, last longer as is recommended to use in a diluted form.

The peppermint just hits different. Gives a tingly effect all over the body and I feel so clean afterwards. Smell great too. Would highly recommend.

Peppermint is by far my favorite. I swim and use it for hair and body afterwards and it's perfect for ridding my body of chlorine and not drying out my skin.

A great useable product to cleanse my body on a daily basis. Just that mint flavor that comes with the product that makes it a great product for me personally.

I got it bc the big bottle always leaves me smelling so good. I can't even smell this. :(

I'm reviewing the peppermint "flavor" specifically--some of my comments may not apply to other scents. After reading on Reddit that this product is something for which quality has always been consistently high, then reading the amazing Amazon reviews, I couldn't resist. Who doesn't like a great product that is also all natural and not from a huge conglomerate company? But after using this for a while, I'm wholly UNimpressed. In the shower, the peppermint oil feels a bit like a chemical burn on the face (I'm not unusually sensitive by any means) and as a soap this product is so-so. We also tried using it in a foam pump dispenser at the kitchen sink. It works great for foam soap but after you wash your hands they just don't feel clean. I assume it's the oil but I'm not sure. Also peppermint scent is nice until you want to eat something hand-held like a burger or burrito. Then not so much. I have found that I like it as a shampoo but it is very liquid so getting it on your head is a little difficult, and you do NOT want to get this in your eyes. I would not try this on a pet--that would qualify as animal cruelty because I'm certain it would be too strong and give a burning sensation, not to mention the concern for getting it in their eyes or nose or ears.There's a reason that one reviewer found a half-used bottle at a garage sale.

This review is for the 2 pack of Dr Bronner soap in 25 oz bottles....I have bought 32 oz bottles of Dr Bronner soap for years and years.  I accidentally bought this 25 oz size this time - what a rip off.  25 oz and 32 oz are almost the same price on Amazon.  I will be more careful next time !!!!  Also when this arrived it was loose and leaking all over the inside and outside of the box.  When the replacement came, the caps were not screwed on tight, but luckily this time it wasn't leaking! Thank you for making me SURE to check for 32 oz next time, I like 32 oz way better.

Clearly the soap ingredients have changed in the past year. It has a different aroma than before and smells, for lack of a better word, cheaper. I strongly disapprove of companies which silently opt to use cheaper ingredients to buff up sales margins. I'd much rather pay slightly more and get what I'm expecting. I would rate 1/5 but credit where it's due, at least I'm cleaner after use.

Very disappointed in the size. I could have gotten a bottle quite a bit larger for the same price at the grocery store.

I like the product but one of the two bottles arrived empty.  The box was wet and had a sticker on it saying that the box arrived damaged.  It‚Äôs not eligible for return, based on what I read.  Don‚Äôt want to send it back, just want a full second bottle. Always tough to ship liquids, but at the least, I‚Äôd like to receive what I paid for

Soap leaked  and seal half off

I believe I wrote a review on the bigger size.  I tried it about 3 years ago, and the peppermint was so strong, it felt like it was burning my lungs, even after I had diluted it about 50 to one.  I wound up dumping the bottle.  I decided to give it another chance and just use it for floor mopping, so I ordered a small one.  This one is quite different.The first one seemed cleaner, this one, oilier -- I can understand how people are complaining that it has clogged their drains. The first one had that ach!  smell of peppermint.  This one smells of tobacco.  Maybe the first one said it contained hemp, but I don't think so.I did give it 2 stars this time instead of 1 because I added some to my Ivory dish soap, and the suds from one squirt of the combination made enough suds on my sponge to do a whole sinkful of dishes, yet they rinsed off easily.  It also makes a decent amount of foam in the foaming soap dispenser.  The smell, however, will not have me coming back for more.

Came damaged with half the soap spilt in the box. Very disappointed. Love the soap but it could have been packaged better

There is nothing wrong with the actual product, but it arrived with both tops broken and leaking into the box because they included no padding to protect the product during shipping.  Now, I have to deal with the mess, broken tops, and less soap (since a good amount leaked).

This soap was highly recommended everywhere I looked for as an alternative to poisons for getting rid of aphids in a garden. So I bought this to kill off some aphids that had gotten into my Hydroponics garden but it just never seemed to get the job done.

Reading the other reviews, this sounded like a great product.  Ordered some for ourselves and had some sent to my daughter.  This stuff just doesn't clean like they say.  Coming in from working outside, grime on my hands and arms from the shop do not get anywhere close to clean using this.  Cheap Irish Spring does a much better job of cleaning than this does.  Totally disappointed with this.  The "dilute, dilute, dilute" saying just doesn't work either.  Using it full strength barely makes suds at all.  Using full strength on the hair does bring about a pretty good tingling but I just don't see it cleaning like it is adertised to do.

I have been using Dr. Broonner for decades; I have NEVER seen it sold in this size, their Website list 2oz, 4oz, 8oz, 16oz, 32oz, 1/2 Gallon, 1 Gallon. The description does say 25 oz but the authentic company website doesn‚Äôt list this size anywhere on their website, so I am not sure what it is, looks like their product, but the scent is weaker than the last bottle I bought, I don‚Äôt think I will buy from this seller again, it seems wrong.

I tried this stuff at our friends house a few weeks before ordering it, the one at there house seemed much thicker, the bottle we got ( same exact bottle) seems very thin or watered down,maybe an old batch ? not the same strength as the one at our friends house

I have been using this product for 6 months, never had an issue before other then when I put it on my private parts (don‚Äôt recommend). Recently I used some to wash my body as I always do, and it burned my skin. Not sure why it did this time, they recommend diluting it with water. I never have and did not have an issue, this time I did. I love this company so I will be using another scent from them. Just not peppermint.

This is not the quality that it once was. I once was able to take one bottle and make two. The scent is minimal compared to what it once was and felt slimy rather than squeaky clean. Also seriously overpriced. Will not buy online again.

I started using this lotion as well as the peppermint soap at night before bedtime.  After three nights of tossing and turning and getting no sleep I finally got on the computer and did some research.  My research revealed that peppermint can keep you awake and it was this peppermint lotion and soap that was keeping me up at night.  Because I shower at night and put on lotion after my shower these two purchases were a complete waste of money for me.  It would be extremely helpful if the company indicated somewhere in the description that their lotion can have this effect.

One of the containers was leaking and the top was broken. It looked as if it was dropped during packaging.

When the soap was delivered the caps were broken and some soap had leaked into the box.

Five star product. I rated this soap with two stars in the hope that people would actually read it and it would not get buried in the sea of 05 star reviews. Straight to the point. If you partake in oily food like olive oil. Or fatty meats like beef and pork. This soap will not work in those particular areas that involve cleaning. That is the only way I can say it without being gross. Other than that this soap is wonderful and it can be used all over your body. I see no reason not to recommend this product as long as while using this product you have a good old fashioned bar soap to clean your tougher areas. I have used 128 ounces of this soap before posting this review to make sure my conclusion was factual. Enjoy!

Sorry to say that the product we received and the product we purchased are different. I've used this brand by Dr. Bronner and LOVE the peppermint soap. This product is diluted with water or something to water it down. The scent is not as strong as the real stuff. I thought something was wrong with this soap and decided to buy it directly from the manufacturer. When I received the soap from the manufacturer it was very evident that this product was diluted with water. Don't buy from this seller.

I ordered a two pack and only received one bottle.  It was going to be too much of a pain to return it,  so I kept it and it does seem like normal Dr. Bronner's but it's clearly been repackaged because the bottle is an unusual size,  the cap is really hard to open and there was NO SECURITY SEAL on it.  I'd say DON'T BUY this! Find a more reputable seller.

I love this soap but I was sent some that was way past expiration. No peppermint smell at all, it smells off. I would have returned it but I hadn‚Äôt opened it until after the expiration of return window. I‚Äôll buy at the grocery store from now on. I hadn‚Äôt noticed but it even had the older label art. (Bottle on right side). You snooze you loose I guess. Maybe I‚Äôll use it as car wash. üôÑ

The soap is great. Biodegradable, great for camping. Whoever packaged it is an idiot though. They put FOUR "gripper labels" on one of the bottles (in a way that made no sense whatsoever) and the nozzle broke as I tried to take them off. If you were trying to prevent leaks, you definitely did the opposite because now I can't take the bottle camping with me. It'll definitely leak. Thanks a lot idiot

For those into pain, this is the soap for you.  I've used Dr. Bronner's other soaps and they're great, but the Peppermint version is a sadists dream.  There is no problem with the normal areas of skin, but the mucus membrane areas such as the edge of the eyelids, the poop chute, and for the guys, Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire comes to mind.  For the ladies, you'd better learn how to do a handstand in a stall shower in order to put out the fire.

My fault being a late night purchase and not paying attention to size of bottle.  It's horribly overpriced for being 25 oz bottle.  I thought I was getting the bigger one around 32 oz.  Plus the cap was cracked and might have been leaking but was wrapped in a plastic bag. I usually get them at Costco for 2 bottles for same price.  Go through Bronner's website instead if ordering online.

Bottles were leaking in package opened package and leaked all over my kitchen floor

I was a little apprehensive with buying this because of the price hike, but I figured it being such a good product it would be worth it. WRONG!!! It is so watery. You can barely smell the strong scent of peppermint which usually make its way to your nostrils as soon as you open the bottle.  And the smell it leaves on your skin is not the usual pepperminty smell. What a disappointment...

I‚Äôve liked every scent of dr bronner‚Äôs except for peppermint. The minty feeling only made me feel extremely cold and I had to huddle under the hot water and in a bunch of blankets even after the shower. Not relaxing at all. I also noticed that it left my skin extremely dry compared to other scents and it burned my nipples. :( Ill stay with the brand but with a different scent for sure.

The bottle seems different. It's a bit flimsy, whereas the regular bottle is more of a hard plastic. I can't tell a difference in smell just yet. One of my bottles arrived with the lid broken off. Shipping was quick enough. But, I'd rather not have the rush cost me a damaged product.

I bought this with the intent to use it as shampoo. It really helped with my dry and itchy scalp. HOWEVER, if you use it in the shower, it hurts your downstairs parts. Be warned. If you can wash your hair in a salon-style sink, it's great as shampoo. If you have to standup and wash your hair, consider yourself warned.

This doesn‚Äôt seem like the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù. Leaves a film on everything. Doesn‚Äôt tingle like I remember when I first used this years ago. Very thin and watery. This used to be a great product but has obviously changed.

I love the soap but the box was mishandled and the plastic bottle leaked all the soap out through the plastic wrap, and all over the inside of the box.

Reading the reviews, I was excited to try this.  I wish I had just passed on it.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I have hard water, but this doesn‚Äôt work.  There is no lather, and there is a film left on my skin.  I won‚Äôt be buying this again.

It's soap, but honestly I'm not sure if it's legitimate Dr.Bronners. They don't sell the 25 oz on their website. AT ALL. You'd be better off getting it from Target or the ACTUAL website. That's what I did when I realized they don't sell this size.

The delivery was good but the soap itself is awful. After using it, it leaves a very oily stock residue. It won‚Äôt come off when rinsing. Have to use Dawn dish soap. I‚Äôm disappointed!

The product is good, as we all know since it‚Äôs been around for over 4 decades. This specific seller, however, shipped the wrong items and won‚Äôt allow returns or replacements. Definitely recommend this great product, but not from the marketplace seller.

Product came damaged and there was a hole in the safety seal lid. I've bought this product before and loved it but I don't like that it came with a broken safety seal at all.

I have used Dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint soap for years. Either they changed the scent of the soap or something is wrong with the bottle I got, because it does not smell how it should. It‚Äôs just off.

I love to use this as a body wash especially in the summer. It makes you feel really refreshed and cleaned.

Isn't very strong with the mint smell. That's unfortunately for me, half the reason I bought it. Seems like a typical liquid soap concentrate.Not a bad soap, just not what I was led to believe.

I‚Äôve had people say I smell like a Christmas tree after using this. It stays for a while too. Not what I‚Äôm looking for. It burns too probably from the peppermint I would dilute it. The unscented version is much better and cleans just as well. Try the unscented. No burn and great light earthy smell to it. You won‚Äôt regret it.

I bought this to eliminate ants from my garden, but I'm not sure if it works..ants went to another plant.

Small bottle read size before purchase /100% valid

Much smaller than I expected.  I thought I was getting a large bottle.  It is much smaller than it appeared in the advertisement.

This item came leaking out of the box no way the Amazon people didn‚Äôt notice this and it‚Äôs common sense to add bubble wrap to a big liquid product, besides that the product is great very minty as expected, don‚Äôt ignore the diluting instructions it saves product you would be using more product then you need.üíØ

The cap is broken. Seal is good but once I break the seal I won‚Äôt have a way to cap/reseal it.

I have been using this soap for years - this bottle arrived and the soap was very cloudy which is odd but it‚Äôs also very cold right now so maybe that affected it somehow? Waiting to see. And the cap was smashed to pieces. Not the biggest deal in the world but also a bummer.

I used this a long time ago. For some reason I remembered it as more minty smelling and feeling.I was looking forward to a tingle, not just on the scalp or sensitive areas, but I didn't get it.The smell is nice enough but the mint of it goes away quickly. The clean soapiness smell does stay for a while but the mint part didn't.And I guess because of the coconut oil, I didn't feel as clean as I wanted. My hair felt sticky, I couldn't get my fingers through it without fear of breaking off hair and I'm not used to that. Definitely needed conditioner to make it manageable again. Not a good shampoo, lesson learned.My body didn't feel as sticky but it definitely felt like something was being deposited on my skin when what I wanted was to feel like I was cleaning stuff off. I can't describe it properly. I guess it's like washing your hands with hand cream instead of hand soap. I wasn't looking for dry tight skin but I do admit to wanting the feeling of sweat, dirt, the stress of the day, being stripped off before a sealant was put on.I don't know how I remembered so incorrectly about this unless the formulation changed. It's not bad, just not what I wanted in a body cleanser.Such a good deal on 2 of these bottles though that I will probably use it in combination with something else (as a 2nd step) or employ it in one of the household uses; with coconut oil being the second ingredient after water, maybe the wood floors and furniture Will benefit.

The scent is great, but you must dilute it a lot, otherwise, it will have a burning sensation on your skin. After diluting it so much, I use larger portions to lather properly as a body wash (I have oily skin), which makes the diluting process useless.

I absolutely love the product however the shipping leaves a lot to be desired. The two bottles came in a slightly oversized box with no padding whatsoever, this allowed the bottles to bounce around destroying both caps. I will have to transfer the contents to other bottles, this isn't that difficult but I shouldn't have to do this, it's the second shipment that has had this same problem. Just packing the box better would solve this, put some air pillows in the box and protect the caps.

Seems to be watered down

I really like using this brand, and was anticipating receiving my two bottles. When I received the items, both tops were broken and one of the bottles had leaked. This is the only reason for such a low review. Packaging should be better to protect products.

I bought this, trying to get fair trade soaps to use in the shower. This one did not fit the bill. For one, castile soap may have many uses, but it has low efficacy in the shower if you like a good lather. Plus, this peppermint one smelled STRONG (which is usually true when you get peppermint, but still). I ended up passing on it, mainly because it just wasn't working and it had weird, heretical things written on the bottle about Jesus. I looked it up, and it's just transcripts of the crazy religion that Dr. Bronner was trying to spread when he was alive. But he claims that Jesus learned everything from a Rabbi Hillel, so if you love Jesus, just know that this is written all over the Bronner bottles.

The price for the size was okay, but I was disappointed by the almost watery consistency of the product; the scent was not as potent either.My frame of reference is based on previous purchases from a high priced supermarket in my neighborhood, and Amazon. This current one from Amazon poured out like water (I lost 1/4 of the bottle's content during my first use of it, because I anticipated a slow out-pour of the liquid, and held it at and sharp angle to facilitate that. But it was not as thick as the previous ones). The scent was not as strong as the previous ones I've bought.I usually use it as shampoo and bath for my pet and shampoo for myself. While I'm glad that it did not dry out my hair as the others have, it did not leave that strong, scent on my pet as in previous times that I've used it to keep away fleas and ticks.

This soap to me is a luxury. Dissatisfied with the caps and quality of the product. From now on I will only purchase in local stores.Amazon will not return or replace.

I've been using this stuff for years and it has been great. I know what it looks like and feels like out of the bottle. On my most recent order the product was significantly diluted from the last time I purchased it 2 years ago. The viscosity was much thinner, the color was much lighter (see photo, new bottle at right, older purchase at left,) there were many more and smaller bubbles collected at the top of the bottle. Either a middleman is cutting this before reselling it, or they are doing it at the factory. Either way, this stuff is super expensive to begin with but how you are apparently now getting even less for your money.

My first purchase of this item was great, my most recent purchase of this item I received the unscented one instead of the peppermint.

Be aware that items can arrive with broken to busted lids due to shipping/mishandling.

We love this product and have been using it for years.  A little goes a long way and our whole family enjoys the peppermint smell.  What made me give this a lower review is all in how it arrived.  As seen in the pictures I included, both lids were smashed, and no longer usable, the second bottle was individually wrapped, even though the other was not, which wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal except, the one that was wrapped was leaking and was SUCH A MESS!  Once I got all that cleaned up, I then had to locate lids that would work in place of the ones that came with the bottles. I suspect that they would not have arrived in such rough shape if they had some additional packaging.  They were in a box with 2 air bubbles.  That‚Äôs it.

It was small but it should have been cheaper

So this is my first attempt at using a more natural soap product.  I read such great reviews and was hoping to replace many different household products with this one.  I'm not completely sold on it but I do like it for a few things.  I have used it to wash my son's soccer shinguard socks which get pretty dirty and stinky.  This gives it a nice minty clean smell and gets out the dirt.  I have tried it as shampoo and my hair felt gross.  I tried it as face wash and liked it but was super worried to get it in my eyes and sting, though it did seem to clean my skin without drying. (Have since tried Dr Bronner's Lavender bar soap on face instead and like it for face wash.)I used it as dish soap and hand soap.  It didn't get really sudsy for dishes and for hand washing it made my hands feel dry.  Overall it did not replace 18 things for me as the label purports. I continue to try it thinking I'll just get used to it.  Hoping to use it in some homemade laundry soap "recipes" but no big high hopes.  Speaking of the label I almost didn't even buy it because of some very unusual preaching on the label (spaceship earth?!) but when I researched a little apparently the family left the label design to honor Dr Bronner though they don't necessarily push the same beliefs now.  Fair trade ingredients and a natural product are old school beliefs I'm glad they maintain.Check your local grocery store for the smaller bottles.  I paid almost as much for a 4 oz bottle through a seller on Amazon that a 8 oz bottle costs at Target or Kroger.  :(

This will take your color out if you use too much. You learn from your mistake but it stop the itch. someone told me it will stop the itching for dry scalp

I wish I liked this product more but I won't buy it again. I used it mainly for cleaning dishes and pots and it seemed to always leave a filmy residue on them. The smell is pretty over powering if you're sensitive to smells. It also doesn't suds up at all. That might not be important but I don't have the confidence that it's doing a good job cleaning.

Ok I bought this to make natural shampoo.  What a disaster.  I even tried it for a couple of weeks since there were comments about detoxing from chemical shampoos.  I even tried to use a dime amount. When my husband asked me if I was going for the rastafarian look, I decided it was time to throw in the towel and used it as a floor cleanser instead.  My floor looks and smells great!!! My hair on the other hand is a greasy mess.  For the record this was my  homemade shampoo: 1/4 c coconut milk, 1/4 c Dr Bronner's, some drops of essential oil, a drop of olive oil and a pinch of gelatin for thickening. When that didn't work, I tried just the coconut milk and Dr Bronners.  When that didnt work, I tried an apple cider vinegar rinse.  When that didnt work I tried a baking soda shampoo after the coconut milk/Dr Bronners and then a vinegar rinse.  Not for me.  (I have a lot of thin frizzy hair, but now its a stiff greasy mess)

Product was packaged properly, however, the bottles were still coated in soap inside the plastic wrapping which got on my hands, and needed to be washed off both bottles. Failed seals on the bottles.

The two bottles were connected at the kids with a plastic harness. The bottles are not sealed under the caps, and the product was not cushioned inside the box. I'm not sure if it froze or if it just got knocked around in the box, but 1/3 of one of the bottles had leaked all over the inside and outside of the box. The box itself had red dye on it and that left a stain on my porch. There were additional items in the box with this that were covered in soap. Luckily they were silicone and not damaged. This may be an Amazon shipping issue, but there should also be a seal under the cap of each bottle to prevent leaks during shipping. The plastic harness did more harm than good as I feel like it helped work the cap loose.

Product arrived leaking in box!

didn't care for fragrance

This was an order for two 32-oz bottles.  I like to product, but one of the re-closable caps was completely destroyed and wrapped in sealed plastic wrap, the other was not wrapped in plastic, but the cap was broken, though still useable.  Not good care in wrapping.

I was in love with this soap after reading about Castile soaps. But have since found out it contains Palm oil which can send cancer into super drive. Most "oils" can. Like canola, cotton, peanut, vegetable , etc. You want to use Lard, Olive oil or coconut oil.

I like the refreshing feel it gives

This product is refreshing and gets the job done. Won‚Äôt do much to clear your skin though.

Product is alright but my thing is why didn‚Äôt it come with a safety seal... last time I ordered this product was last year 2019 and it did come with a safety seal so I‚Äôm kinda sketched out and paranoid not sure if I should use it tbh it did come with a line of tape on the very top of the bottle but that still doesn‚Äôt take away fr the fact that this product had no safety seal... I mean all products should include safety seals? I‚Äôm kinda sketched out idk if I will be using this product might do a patch test before using on my entire body but overall smells awesome

Great product but the cap came totally broken to where it can‚Äôt even be opened without fully taking it off. Not a big deal but very annoying.

I use this soap for natural cleaning products, and hand washing. The scent is great, but one of the tops had loosened and the seal was broken. Soap was leaked into the box. The bottles seemed secure, but I think the package was probably handled too roughly for a liquid soap product.

Not as concentrated as they make it sound, it make my skin dry but it‚Äôs smells good and it give you a nice cool feeling.

First let me start by saying I am a African American woman who bought this product on the recommendation of another AA woman.Pros: I LOVE THE SMELL! And when i washed my hair, i needed about a dime sized amount for 1/4 of my hair and it lathered REALLY wellCons: It completely stripped ALL the moisture and product from my hair and skin. When this product says its a degreaser, believe it! My hair felt dry and hard even in the shower with water running thru it!Ill probably only use this to wash my hair when i want to strip all the old product from my hair. I think ill try cleaning the house with most if this instead.

I disliked that my items came damaged and leaked.

But the product is amazing on your skin and the dirt just falls off like the soap has been blessed by a and angle of god and dirt on your body is the demons running away all of them sqicky clean

My review isn't for most people. I bought this soap to try to use as an organic form of insecticide. As a soap it smells very strong and pleasant of mint and works well for cleaning. As an insecticide for aphids. Nope they were not phased in any way shape or form even with treatment for a couple weeks and adding in cayenne.For those looking for an organic insect control option, keep looking. Aphids will die of old age and kill your plants before this will do anything.For those looking for a castile soap for soap sake, it's nice and pleasantly strong in fragrance and works fine. Go for it.

Great product that I‚Äôve used many times from other sellers before but this time it was delivered with both broken caps that are not usable so I‚Äôll need to transfer to another bottle. I was unable to get in touch with the seller to replace it.

I love this product which is why I bought it again. This time the pair arrived with damaged caps. This would seem trivial, except that they‚Äôre so badly damaged and one bottle slightly leaking to make me wonder what have these bottles been through. Were they expired and someone went dumpster diving to sell them online? The product smells normal and seems fine. It just makes you wonder....

I use it for bathing and some laundry. I love how it keeps my diabetic skin from drying out after bathing, it cleans my skin  and rinses off with no residue  I love Dr. Bronner's products

This stuff has been around for years, seems to be the same formulation I remember from the 1970's.  It smells OK.  Using it as hand soap only for really grimy hands as it leaves my hands feeling stripped of natural oil necessitating hand lotion afterwards.  I wouldn't use it regularly as it's harsh on my sensitive skin.  Would NOT use it as a body soap, and would be afraid it would strip my hair of it's natural oil if used it as shampoo, even diluted.  Have washed the dishes, cleaned up the kitchen with it (floors, counter tops etc) little goes a long way.  Really I don't want to use a product on my body that you can clean the toilet with!

I used the product at a friend's house which they had purchased a while ago and I loved. I then ordered the same thing and it was extremely watered down which did not give me the same experience. Please sell a quality product for the money that we are spending....

I have use this for about a week and I‚Äôm still on the fence as to whether or not it is worth it for bathing. It is no good for washing here but it seems to be OK for the skin.  I live in a very cold and dry climate and was looking for something that moisturize my skin and it seems to be working decent but nothing to brag about.

I‚Äôm a longtime Dr. Bronner‚Äôs consumer. This is  a great product. Unfortunately, I did read the reviews of people getting this product damaged and not being able to return/replace it. Yep it also happened to me. There was absolutely no padding or bubble wrap in the box. I received it damaged and with some soap spilled inside of the box. Buyer beware.

All good üëçüèΩ üëåüèΩ

Have used Br Bonner for years and the price as well as free shipping is awesome.

I approve of the product.I appreciate the history and philosophy on the label. However the instructions are not readable because of the ultra small print.Use instructions should be readable andseparate.

Love everything about Bonner‚Äôs soap!  But the shipping of the soap was not good.  The top on one of the bottles was broken.  I don‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of returning it, so I will just keep it.

Love it

It did not have much of a peppermint fragrance.

Great castile soap. Works as expected.

The bugs eat, and kill my zucchini plants every year. this did not help much. I would have to spray at least twice a day.

I've been using Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap for many years and always love it, however, I do feel it's priced too high.

I love this particular variant of the soap. Does what it needs to do and more. My only gripe is the packaging. This is the second time it's come to me with poor and or subpar packaging.. If they can take better care with the packaging so your soap does not spill out. Besides that, Amazing product.

I use this product, works for the whole family.

Use this product all the time. Would give 5 stars but for the cost.

I use this as shampoo and body soap. Love the tingle feeling from the peppermint. Good way to wake up in the morning.

Pros:I love the peppermint smell, and after a shower, it feels like my skin is tingling. The scent is long-lasting, and I honestly do feel cleaner after use.Cons:For people who love suds and the bubbly feeling of liberally applied soap, they are bound to be disappointed, however. The soap doesn't really form a lather, and it takes a significant amount to see foam or froth start to form.I had no issues with the packaging, and this is definitely something I'll be purchasing frequently, as it's already been added to my cleansing routine.

Great gift idea for someone living in a warm climate.  Tingly clean and refreshing

Smells good but I thought the soap would be thicker; more like a gel. It is watery so you end up using a lot of it.

This body wash smells amazing and leaves you feeling very clean. However, it is drying so be sure to moisturize after!

The actual soap it self is amazing. The top was just really cheap and broke after 3rd use. I couldn‚Äôt close it so when it fell over it leaked out resulting in losing some soap. But other than that the soap was very moisturizing and I love the tingling linger on my skin. I feel clean clean!

I really like Dr. Bronner's - Pure-Castile Liquid Soap (Peppermint, 8 Ounce).  It works well for household cleaning as well as washing my body.  I love the fresh scent and it makes your body feel so refreshed...especially in the summer heat.  The only thing I don't like and will probably affect whether I purchase again is the price.  It goes too fast in my house so, that $10 for only 8oz is too much.  If there's a good sale on it then yes, I'll buy it.

The normal Dr soap. But smaller. Meh. Kind of lame to get a smaller one than usual but that‚Äôs what we get for uncle Joe in office.

The quality of the soap is great - the peppermint smell seems a bit off, maybe I could‚Äôve gotten a bad batch. I‚Äôve never used this soap to wash my body with, but it does a great job at cleaning dirty sneakers. The ingredients in this make it appealing to use on shoes of all kinds of materials, and it does work well. Once again, the peppermint smell is a bit odd, but I could‚Äôve just gotten a dud bottle. Good soap üßº üëç

I purchased the 16 oz bottle of this nifty gifty as part of my research for when I'm out and about traveling. :)I was mainly interested in how well it cleans the body, how well it acts as shampoo, soap, tooth paste, and cleaning laundry. For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry. I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present. When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)As a toothpaste? It's definitely more of a "function over fashion" kinda thing. Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect. But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that's what's important. Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it's unbearable. For me, it was fine--didn't bother me.For shampoo? Don't use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly. It doesn't last after you've washed your hair and dried it, but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.Overall, I'm not very sure if I'll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling. I think it'd be necessary for washing my clothes, so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me. ;D And it'll also be good for emergencies, when I don't have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something else.I hope my review has helped! Just reiterating, it's a GREAT product. But when a person is able to bring as many 3 oz bottles that can fit comfortably in a zip lock bag, there's really no point in JUST bringing Dr. Bronner's, which is what I was interested in. :) It's definitely not something to knock points off of this product.

The soap is pretty rad actually, you can shave with it, use it for your floor, laundry, body wash, it all does the job. The bottle looks like one of those cars with 600 crazy bumper stickers on it, just crazy writing about cleanliness being godliness.

Smells great bottle is small

I love the soap. Disappointed that I  hadn't noticed the price per ounce.

ALWAYS HAVE USED THIS  ALL PRODUCTS THAT YOU FATHER  FIRST STARTED WAY BACK,I DID NOTICE HIS TIME THE BOTTLES ARE  SMALLER I HAVE A LAGER BOTTLE WE NOTICED IT HAD SHRUNK DOWN IN SIZE  WHY?? OTHER WISE  I TRULY LOVE THIS PRODUCT  PLEASE COSIDER THE LAGER BOTTLED AGAIN  THANK YOU .SWEET BLESSINGS

I like the tingly refreshing feeling you get from this soap.

Besides the shipping the seller lives up to the product and it was packaged really well and everything I expected..

Use as shampoo

I have been using  Dr Bronner‚Äôs Body wash for as long as I can remember... I know how all the different fragrances smell. I tried them all.  I love them all..... However! My favorite is the Peppermint. Especially around Summer time. Just keeps you Fresh and extra clean It‚Äôs all I use and I have sensitive skin. Love the sweet Almond also. I will sometimes buy 2 large bottles at a time. And I have small bottles  that I will pour out and leave in the bathroom. Cause when I leave the big bottles it finish to quick. Everyone wants to use it.üò†  So I will always hide it in my room. ITS NOT CHEAP )That said: I‚Äôm trying to reach out to the company  to return a Large bottle that I brought because the bottle cover was broken and some leaked out. And that box had books in the same box. Thank God the Books was wrapped in plastic and also the Bottle.I‚Äôm just trying to reach out to them to exchange this bottle that leak out my body wash and there‚Äôre no way that I can. No options  to return.The Product is very Good. But I pay for a whole bottle and that bottle spilled. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking.

Caps were damaged on Both bottles. Love the product itself

I liked that I got the right items and in a timely manner.

I liked this product but found it at Walmart for $15.99 for 32 ounces. Very overpriced on Amazon for the 4 ounce bottle.

The product itself is good but the way they shipped it, not so much. They used just a plastic bag to ship it which I believe is why one cap was broken as shown in the pictures. Luckily it is a two pack so I can just reuse the one undamaged lid for when I need to use the second bottle. The soap itself is fine and the safety seal was not broken so no leakage happened. I blame amazon for using a thin plastic bag instead of a bubble wrap bag or a cardboard box for shipping not the Dr. Bronners company.

I love Dr. Bronners products, consistently, but be careful and read descriptions. For the price, I thought that I was getting two 32 oz, but these are 25 oz, so small for the price that you can buy in a local store.4 stars for it being what it is, and the fast same-day delivery.

Smells good but this product will light up the family jewels. Youve been warned

Feels cleaner then regular Soap & smells good

Strong scent, did not have the cooling effect everyone was talking about, was useful for washing clothes, left a great minty scent.

Dr Bronners has a unique product you will like. Used it for years

Soap is very very intense. I didn‚Äôt know if my body felt cold or hot. Very powerful product

Smells great and works great!

Pleasant smell.

I love this soap for showering.  I took away 1 star as the product arrived with the caps of both bottles broken.  I inquired about new caps only being sent but Amazon replied they can't do that.  I now have to come up with a suitable container I can switch to which is a pain!  (Love the product though and I have to assume the damage occurred during delivery.)

It cleans very well. It leaves your body very refreshing and relaxing!!

Great product -I use it regularly.  On the last two shipments (of the two pack) the snap lids were broken from impact. This makes the continued use of the caps nearly impossible.  The product did not leak due to the seal under the cap. Better packing is needed to protect the caps.

I love DR Bronners, I usually get the Hemp Almond and it works great for everything. This also works great for everything, but im critical of this because when I use it to wash my face it is severely strong... I cant close my eyes because of the stinging from the menthol on the eyelids for a solid 2 minutes.. OK maybe quick blinks, but it still stings alot. The menthol is alittle overpowering with this scent, I will probably try one of the other ones after this bottle.. This stuff is still the real deal DR. Bronners, still cleans better than anything else i've found, and still natural, so its definitely not all bad but I would recommend a different scent. The bottle is also alittle too "rainbow people" for me and I only read it when im sitting on the john and want a good laugh.. Where do they come up with some of this stuff?

Use it for bathing but also use it to wash my hair at times

I had my hopes high for this soap, and I was not disappointed. I did not try the bar version of this, only the liquid and it is pretty impressive. First thing I noticed when opening the box up is that there are A LOT of words on the bottle. It is some serious bathroom-reading material, has stuff on there not even related to the soap. Forget smartphone poops, it's going to be peppermint poops from now on. Next, when using a loofah it builds an amazing lather. Only a few drops will build enough lather to form a beard worthy of Santa himself. What else is good is that when using it, it tingles the body after a few seconds AND it smells just like candy canes. So while you're tingly and refreshed, you'll be smelling candy canes for the duration of the shower. So let me summarize all this up in simple pro and con form.Pros:Builds great latherSmells like candy canesLots of reading material on bottleTinglesCons:Soap itself is just barely more viscous than water, easy to use too much (if trying to ration)Price is higher than other body-washCandy cane smell does not last long, and is not powerful once dry

I was surprised as to what this can be used for. Directions for 18 ways on the bottle.I bought the Peppermint and it smells so good.

We not only use this for hand soap and dishwashing soup we use this for our shampoo and also for dog shampoo because it lathers up like no other and rinses so well. It's perfect!

Great for shaving. Invigorating. Grandson can NOT use other soaps. We used it on the farm to cure Ringworm on a horse. Highly concentrated. When I was young, washed hair, brushed teeth, bathed and washed dishes when camping. Good for the environment and people. Thanks Dr. Bronner

We've been using this product for a long time and we are happy to be able to get it here on Amazon. Thank you!

Used this soap as an ingredient in a cat repellent for houseplants. Works well.

We love this soap! Make sure to water down a little bit before use because it‚Äôs strong.

Concentrated so goes a long way. Love the smell.Been using Dr Bronners for about 20 years now off grid living.Doesn‚Äôt need my recommendation, it‚Äôs a well established brand.

I purchased this soap because it has no toxins in it!  Trying to clean up my act. I‚Äôm impressed with all the things it can be used for. I just made a spray out of it for some pests I have on my flowers. I am hopeful this will do its job well. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work well enough for the flowers, I am happy to use it as a bath wash. Nothing in it to upset my body inside or outside!  So glad these type products are available!

This stuff makes my skin feel like it‚Äôs gonna explode

I've used this product for many years, and it is superb. Great for skin and hair, and eases itchy skin.

I use to shower and wash my hair. The tingles, yes the tingles! Try it!

Dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint has always gotten the job done! You will literally be able to hear the squeak of clean, but be sure you moisturize after.

Smells good but I like baby scent better

This lather's great but I noticed it kind of dried out my skin. I paired it with one of my moisturizing body washes, and it's great!

I Love Dr. Bronner's Castile soap, especially the peppermint! Refreshing, invigorating, and gentle - perfect for daily use.I used this travel size on a recent camping trip, I used it to bathe, on my dishes and my clothing. A little goes a long way so I have a lot left for upcoming trips. This particular bottle was great, it wasn‚Äôt flimsy like most travel containers. Will be ordering another to have on hand.

I was told to purchase this soap to use before and after my spray tan. I am so glad I did. It makes my skin feel so silky smooth without leaving any kind of residue. I absolutely love it and now I use it even without getting a spray tan. It‚Äôs my new routine soap and I highly recommend it!!

Love the soap, used it for years and was glad to find it on Amazon!

Not a harsh soap but such a good cleanser. Ive used it for many years since the hippie days and still can't find anything i like better i love it.

Best thing for a soothing and relaxing bath. Great in the shower too!

love it

Laundry, shower wash & washing floors..Read dilution directions for all applications on the bottle...fyi..keep away from your eyes..

Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap needs no further reviewing, as it remains as perfect as when I first discovered it back in the 1970s to my continuing to enjoy it in the 2020s! It is absolutely the best!

I loved this. I took it with me on vacation to Puerto Rico and it kept mosquitos off of me. I recommend to take on vacation to places where mosquitos will bite often.

So many uses.  Great smell.

Great soap/shampoo.

I like it very much very mental and cool on skin

The best soap for summer bathing! The slight minty feel cools the body down!

Dr Bronner's is the best soap around! It's the only one I think cleans the body fully, and it's good for other household uses. Like laundry, cleaning. It's good for you and it's good for the environment. Sorry, Lume.....you don't cut it!

Best soap ever created. Worth the price. A little goes a long way. All natural and can be used on the entire body.

Awesome soap

I love this soap!

Perfect! Just like the bar soap. Easy to travel with an less waste. Perfect!! Everyone in the family loves this soap.

I have loved Dr. Bronner‚Äôs for years. I love it.

I love the peppermint feeling

I usually buy this at another store but the price was good here. My boyfriend and I only use the peppermint. We use a Dove body wash and this soap for our private parts, everything feels so fresh afterwards.

Good price,good soap,quick delivery

Cleams and refreshes my body better than any other soap I've ever used!! The peppermint in the soap activates a cool sensation when using it. This will be the only soap I'll be using from now on, except for Black Soap.

I just might not buy any other soap again

Long time fan of the product.

I use it as body wash.

This bottle has a rancid smell. I buy only lavander for already a couple years and this bottle is nothing like a lavander flavor. It has a weird smell like it went bad. Nasty. I just can't believe it. Its not cheap eather. And you can't return it :). I think this was a some type of scam.) i will leave review. I doubt its gonna help but still maybe someone else has gonna notice.

I used Dr Bronners years ago, and decided to buy it again. Love the scent of lavender. Did not love how it reacts to the hard water here in California!  It leaves an awful residue on my hand washed dishes etc, leaves things (including my hands) with an almost ‚Äòwaxy‚Äô/‚Äòtacky‚Äô feel. Also it clouds the water, looking ‚Äòmilky‚Äô. Now I have to re-wash my dishes with another soap. Gross, costly, and time consuming.I tried to return it and the form states it is non returnable! So, I will call Amazon customer service right away. So beware if you live in an area with hard water.  If you‚Äôre not sure, you can first test yourself water.I learned about the hard water problem, after experiencing it firsthand. Wish I‚Äôd have known in advance. Maybe they could notice where the shipment is going to, because California is known for having hard water.

Yuck. Dried our skin out terribly. It's also important to note that the product page lists incorrect ingredients. 5 items are missing from the ingredient list. Potassium Hydroxide, Palm Kernal oil, Jojoba oil, Citric Acid and Tocopherol. I'll include a picture of the ingredients listed on the bottle. Not as beneficial for us as it initially seemed, since my child is allergic to two of those ingredients. Not impressed.Side note (this did not affect my review rating but) what is up with all the disjointed, rambling text on this bottle's label? "Full truth, God's Law," "Mohammed's Arabs, 1948," "Be not like dumb, driven cattle." And it's literally covering the entire bottle in every direction possible. I mean, that's cool I guess... But it's kinda like reading a crazy person's thoughts or getting a mega helping of propaganda along with my soap.  Just weird.

If you want to wash your body with something that smells like a floor cleaner, this is the right product for you. Not only does it smell like Pine Sol, it feels harsh like a dish/clothes detergent (which is apparently one of the recommended uses for this product). After just two uses it irritated my skin so much that I had to return in. The label on the bottle is full of religious propaganda to the point that it is completely overwhelming the description of the quality of the ingredients of the actual product. It feels as if the purpose of this product is not to provide the consumers with a quality organic body wash, but rather to dispense the company's religious views and opinion onto general public. I am completely disappointed with both quality of the product, the fact that it is irritating to the skin, and the overall appearance/marketing of the product. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and will never purchase it again.

Excellent soap. Truly my favorite soap. BUT. The label is absolutely covered with religious drivel. It is hard to believe all the other claims on the label when there are literally thousands of words on the label devoted to God.I'm an atheist. But I love how clean this leaves EVERYTHING. Yes, I'll buy it and use it but here is my one star in protest. Seriously, it is 2020. No need to get on your soapbox about God.Some competitors are getting closer. I will happily switch the day I find a better product.

1. This soap clogs our automatic dispenser often making it unusable unless you scratch out the dispenser hole or run hot water over it, often making it worthless.2. Clogs our hand pump so much so that may not work and if it does there may be so much pressure that the soap will spew across the sink and hit you in the shirt like a popped zit.3. Clogs drains so that often times when you run water, it doesn't drain well and often can kick up some rather foul odors.I probably haven't used but a cup of this stuff over 2 weeks but I'm sending it back and will never buy again.

Let me say that I love Dr Bonner's products. I have used them regularly for years. The seller providing this product comes very highly recommended, so I am not sure what went wrong. Product was runny and had no scent even though it was "lavender". Packaging did not look like it was tampered with however I did not get what I usually do. So either it's been knocked off or reformulated. I am disappointed.

This product is really watery and it sticks at the tip of the soap dispenser. It gets so bad that soap will come out in any direction, including your face and it can get to your clothes and make a mess. Just today, I had a stream of soap fly directly into my eye, which caused me to be unable to open my eye for a long time. I do not recommend buying this product and I will not do it again.

The media could not be loaded.
                



This item arrived with a broken cap, so we are unable to use this in a proper manner

I did not like the smell of the Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Liquid Lavender Soap at all. It doesn't smell like lavenders at all to me. It has a rather unpleasant odor. Other cons include: the soap doesn't lather well (although, I have hard water), and it's rather expensive. I will not buy this soap again. I did like the almond liquid soap, however.

I read all the reviews and even waited to buy this.  Do not use in hair as one girl posted, it will ruin your scalp.  I am using it as handsoap now, but it leaves a very disgusting soap scum in the sinks, even had to scrub the drain in the bathroom it was getting clogged from this...All other junk and mold sticks to this, it will clog your drains.  I have not noticed that it can clean anything whatsoever.  It smells very nice though.  It is also more like water in thickness than soap, so it squirts everywhere.

I really like the almond scent; I‚Äôve used it for years and this is a fairly natural product. But this definitely doesn‚Äôt smell like any other product with ‚Äúlavender‚Äù scent. It‚Äôs definitely a more ‚Äúchemically‚Äù smell like lavender mixed with window cleaner. Leaving 1 star because I wasn‚Äôt aware you can‚Äôt return! Next time I‚Äôd like to try a product, I guess I‚Äôll go to Target which DOES accept returns of this item. Your loss Amazon!

The top of the lid is cracked from shipping damage and you can close the bottle properly. Item is not returnable. So now I have to try to find a replacement lid. Tough to do, as these lids have a hinged top with an insert that keeps the opening from clogging with soap as you use it. I need another lid.

I love the peppermint Dr. Bronner's soap very much!  It smells and works great!  I accidentally ordered the Lavender version and it arrived today and smells HORRIBLE!  It's extremely strong and unpleasant, nothing like real lavender at all.  I sure wish I had some of the great peppermint soap to help me get this terrible smell off my hands.  My advice is to be more careful than I was . . . order Dr. Bronner's soap with the dark blue label (you will love it) but stay away from the lavender.

Hate this product. I thought I was going to love it, I‚Äôve used others from this brand and they weren‚Äôt as bad as this one. This soap dried my skin out so badly I started to peel and was sticking to everything I touched. It says you can use it as shampoo, so I did. And my hair was so brittle at the end of this.

I love Dr. Bronner's bar soaps and have been using them for years.  This time I decided to try their liquid soap.  This liquid soap has the consistency of water.  I have never seen a liquid soap like this. It literally pours right out of the bottle like water.  I now intend to order directly from Dr. Bronner's website and compare the product with the one from Amazon.

This smelled nothing like my previous bottle of dr. Bronners lavendar. It smelled so strong like some sort of vegetable oil. It was so gross I had to throw it out.  There was no settling of the coconut oil in the bottom of the bottle. I contacted amazon and they requested a refund for me and I received it within a day.

Not for pump up dispensers. Will shoot out and hit you in the EYE! Yes, eye. Happened to me TWICE! Also leaves a residue in the sink making the sink look greasy. Not great as hand soap neither, when distilled it barely does anything. When not distilled, it takes too long to wash off. I personally did not like the smell of it. I'd return it but that'll be too much hassle, so just gonna trash it.

Over priced on Amazon..doubled priced..

Smells like diesel fuel with a dab of lavendar. At first I thought it was the hemp oil but then I found other lavendar essential oils with the same scent problems. I think the people who they are buying lavendar oil from don't know how to do oil extraction properly. I have other lavendar products that smell exactly like my lavendar plants so it's not just some weird problem in my head.

Yuck. Who ever thought this scent was better than the crap you might be cleaning away? And I didn't notice ahead of time that it's not returnable - even though EVERYTHING else I've ever ordered IS!

I think this product dates back to an era (before "organic") where "natural" meant that a product didn't have to smell or taste as good as mainstream/industrial products.  this stuff smells nasty.  I'm at a loss why you would put it on your body every day.  there are plenty of wonderful smelling organic soaps out there.  IMO, products like this are bad for the environmental movement b/c they confirm the idea that organic is inferior.

Very, very harsh on the skin.  You need tough skin to use this product!  It's the Hemp Oil that makes it sting on sensitive skin.  It made me break out in a rash.  My Dr. said that is very common with Hemp Oil.  Many people are allergic to it.  Beware.

Love the smell and product but the tops are cheaply made.

I‚Äôm not sure but everyone who posted a picture has a clear, yellow liquid and mine is pure white. Can someone please explain to me. I also ordered the citrus. I really need help. Should I leave it to settle.

It can make you stop showering, worst smell ever, o hate it!! They don‚Äôt even allow you to return it

Really upset with amazon for not allowing me to return this item. I never used it before, I tested it out and really hated the smell and how liquidy it was, thought it would be much thicker. Really disappointed in this product and also amazon

this product clogs everything, even its own 32oz bottle , and I mean every liquid soap dispenser , electric, hand pumped its own 32oz bottle, how can you use this lavender soap and that is what it is lavender liquid soap nothing special!

My product arrived with a broken cap and is not eligible for return.

The bottle lid was busted up so bad that it can no longer be used and if not for the safety seal which was questionable since it seemed to be watered down, would have destroyed everything else it was packed with. Won't be buying this product from Amazon.com any more.

I just received my soap and I have to say I knew something wasn't right immediately. If you've ever used real Dr. Bonner's you will too. The soap has been watered down greatly and is way more watery than it should be. Next time I'm just going go to vitamin shop.

Thought it was perfect product for whole body, but my hair got really bristle and my face burnt and irritated. Got few days to recover. I should have bought smaller bottle for testing first but I kind trusted all good reviews.Not for every body and everything. Of course.

Let me start by saying I LOVE Dr. Bronner's soaps. They lather nicely, don't dry my skin out, and usually smell great. Citrus, rose and almond have been my favorites. I tried the lavender for the first time, and unfortunately... I can't stand the smell. I'll probably wind up dumping it and getting almond again.

I bought this hoping for a rich lavender scent, and as soon as I opened the bottle I realized my mistake - the scent is HEMP lavender, and the hemp is overwhelming. I used it once and was gagging through my shower. What a waste of money. So disappointed with this product.

It threw off my ph balance and made my skin break outAlso didn‚Äôt want my real name up so yeah

The produce came to my house broken and poured out over the box and other products. It isn‚Äôt returnable. I am Very disappointed. I paid more money then I wanted and it‚Äôs broken open. They need to package it better.

Eh it‚Äôs very watery not ideal for body wash or bubble bath  I have soft water and the results just not as hyped as made out to be. Pretty disappointed

Had to cancel  too strong a smell

This soap is so watery that when you put it in a pump bottle and use it it sprays all over the counter and all over the user.  Will definitely not be buying this again - probably won't be using it, will try to give it away.

For some reason, this Dr. Bonner's soap smells nothing like the Dr. Bonner's soap I buy at the store.  So unfortunately, this is a purchase I will not make again online.

So this is how my soap came today!! All over the place what a mess!! Not a happy customer!! But the soap smells good.

Product was open and too runny to be true Dr. Bronner‚Äôs soap- very sketchy! Threw away immediately, no returns and no contact. Do not buy!

It was damaged I can‚Äôt even get a refund or replacement

This just came in the mail and it was opened and gooey and got all over the place!

Did not like how watery it was for hand soap

Love the soap, but half the bottle leaked out in the package. The lid was cracked. Quite a mess. Trying to get a replacement.

Lid was broken! Can‚Äôt keep shut because the lid was broken when delivered

broken top when delivered

Doesn't work with the new lice. They laugh at these remedies because they are immune from old remedies. The only remedy that worked was a home remedy that I found online.

Huge mess broken cap / spilled so upsetting

Kind of afraid someone will find me and kill me for this, but this stuff is awful with the water we have in Los Angeles County (hard, presumably) (or I guess maybe just really bad, but no way that many cultis-people would love this stuff if that were the case).It leaves an obvious, irritating, sometimes slightly painful in how uncomfortable it can be residue. Or something. I don't know, I diluted it, bought a foam dispenser, tried it on my hair - ew. Tried as different strength - just as ew. Tried just using it on my hands, didn't like the feeling. Tried using it on my floors - residue. Tried mixing it with DISTILLED water, wasn't able to rinse it out with distilled water since that's way too expensive. Tried cleaning the toilet with it as a last resort, and it seriously made little yellow beads stick to the porcelain. WTF?Smells pretty good though. And it's very very foamy even without the foam dispenser.

Dr. Bronner's has been the go-to in my family for years. I know the formula very well since i've been using it most of my life, and the bottle i received was definitely tampered with, no question. i ordered it off amazon for the convenience, but as soon as i used it the first time, i noticed the formula was as thin as water. I actually went to the store & bought another one to compare... im extremely disappointed. i noticed this is a trend with amazon cosmetics. the "convenience" of ordering online is... well, it'd only be worth it if i was actually getting what i paid for.

I bought two bottles total of the Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castille Liquid Soap.  One bottle of the citrus and one bottle of the lavender.  My husband and I both used it.  He's 65 and I'm 57.  We both had to stop using it as it dried our skin out so bad, really bad.  It actually burns my skin and especially my private parts.  I'll just use the rest of the bottles to wash the floors or something.  It definitely is not for either of our bodies!

Not a fan of this body wash. It dried my skin out and caused a burning sensation when I used it near a small cut. It also is very water causing more to come out then necessary. It also lists serval ways to use the soap on the bottle, which is concerning because I just want my body wash to be good at one thing, washing my body.

I think this product is not so great as a shampoo. I never used a product that left my hair so tangled, sticky, greasy, and covered with chalk like this one! It is very liquid that I have to increase the amount for each application, and then as I shampoo my hair feels so hard and coarse and difficult to manage. After bath, my hair is a mess when I want to comb it,, the only thing that I'll recommend as a shampoo is for those who would like to get the really frizzy, tangled, beach waves look. I used it for cleaning my dishes and a few surfaces, and I am not fond of the smell at all!!

I haven't even used it yet, didn't even know that I ordered it and I thought it was gift.  However, when I checked my account, I must have accidentally ordered it.  It is covered with scripture which I don't mind but this was not WITHIN proper context and much of it was hard to read.  Talk about spreading the gospel.  There should be a disclaimer saying that the packaging of this product is scripture based entirely because I found it offensive and overbearing and I am a believer.  I wanted to send it back but did not want to be bothered with the hassle.  Will gift it.  IT COULD BE A GREAT PRODUCT, I WILL NEVER KNOW....

This is a review of the product used as a shampoo. I personally I didn't like it. It left my hair feeling very rubbery and when my hair was finally dry and could see that it didn't do a good job removing the dirt. I don't know why people rave about this so much. I'm just gonna have to use it around the house, I guess. Don't recommend as a shampoo, though.

I have body acne on my shoulders that has pretty much cleared up because of the beesential soap I was using before but I wanted to try something new so I ordered this soap and it does absolutely nothing for body acne. The acne on my shoulders is actually worse than ever so I wouldn't recommend this soap to anyone with any sort of acne issues.

At first, I thought, "the product must be great because I can smell it while it's still in the box".  Wrong, the cap busted, as it did for other s, and you cannot return it.  Packaging needs to change!  The product does smell really good though.

I'm not a fan. The soap is very thin/runny. It also dries and crusts over the end of the dispenser and causes it to squirt the next time you use the soap. It also leaves a waxy film in the sink that is hard to clean. I tried it for 2 months then threw it out.

Smell is average. The soap is super runny. Products react differently to different people, I understand that, but I didn't have any of the magical moments while bathing that some people effusively reference on here. I guess if you're a "soap purist" it would do it for you...but I'll stick to Dove.

Pros: Great ingredients. Versatile. Gets skin squeaky clean.Cons: repugnant smell, expensive, too thin/watery, and short-lasting foam. As a result of it being so thin and not having a long-lasting foam, we end up using a lot of soap each shower, and thus go through the bottle very quickly. We also don't care for the mind boggling amount of religious jargon that is so extensive that it makes it hard to read the label for consumer/product information.

What kind of smell is important for me. I ordered lavender and came up with peppermint.

I definitely received the wrong kind ! It was supposed to be the peppermint one ! (Blue bottle) but it‚Äôs fine. It works good on the face.

I really didn't like this one too much

I love Bronner‚Äôs but I received it today and the bottle top was damaged and leaking :(

My soap that I received came broken. It smells so good though

It leaves a really weird smell, not like lavender at all, on everything.  In the bottle it smells fine.  It cleans ok. I tried it with the bed linens like Dr Bronner suggests on her page, but the smell it left nauseated me. It didn't dry my skin out when used as a body wash, but it leaves a film behind. I was not impressed.

Everyone says that this is the best scent but I can't stand the smell of it once it gets wet (no longer smells like Lavender). Get the peppermint.This stuff is concentrated though, less is more! Definitely unfortunate for me as I have this whole bottle to get through now.

This soap is slightly drying and the smell is less floral and more astringent.  It also shoots out uncontrollably from my soap dispensers, but not sure if that is because of the soap or my dispenser

I do not like the 'artificial' lavendar smell.  When using this in the laundry or hand soap form the smell is amplified.  Will not purchase again.  Sorry to say.

Not a big fan, smell is not something to look forward to in the morning.  Love their other ones, eucalyptus is by far the best followed by mint.

I purchased this after recommendations from other moms but, I don‚Äôt care for it. It left a white tint all over our tub. I went with another brand.

Used in tub...  leaves a film and burns eyes.

It smells nice but I'm noticing that my skin is much dryer now that I've been using this body wash for a couple weeks.

I tried to use this product to make homemade shampoo and body wash, and I am less than thrilled. After using it I always feel like I have a gunky film left on my body and hair. Using it in a shampoo recipe also leaves my hair very stringy and it looks/feels like it's greasy.

I honestly don't get why this soap has so much fans. I guess it does work, but so does every other soap you can get from anywhere. I couldn't find what is superior about this guy compared to others. Also, it doesn't have a pleasant smell.

I didn't realize how bad it would smell. It is stinky.

Scent is waaaayyyyy too strong for me.

I had never tried this brand before and was disappointed in how runny it is so mixed it into a container with some other soap.  So I am still looking for some castile or olive oil soap with more substance to it.

Thinner than I expected. Writing on bottle is to small, need magnifying glass.

It's good as a cleaning agent for household items, clothes and yes even car. But don't use it on your hair, face or body. It clogs up pores and dries out hair. When left for a couple days without usage, the pump would clog up with solidified soap.

I might like this except for the really strong smell.

It was delivered with broken lid.  I wanted to return but I was lazy

I love lavender, but this scent smells too chemically for me.

Not great for body soap - makes me very itchy

Smelled like medicinal oil. Can‚Äôt return.

this one makes your privates tingly :D

The fragrance of this soap makes it so we don't want to use it on anything.

I did not like this stuff. The smell is great, but it is not good for hair as some people have stated

I don't like the sent.

I do not care for the smell!11

If you love lavendar then this is for you...I found out the hard way I don't like lavender. great for cleaning and projects if you can get over the smell...

I've given this product two months to work as a shampoo. I DO NOT recommend it as a shampoo at all. It left my hair greasy. For two months now everyone who has seen me has probably been convinced I do not bathe, the grease in my hair is that bad. Diluted, not diluted, distilled water, vinegar rinse, apple cider vinegar rinse....does not matter. My hair is greasy and gross. AVOID this product on your hair. It will leave it nasty. And, no a vinegar rinse does not work! I have no idea how people can rave about this as a shampoo...they must not care that their hair is gross!I've been able to use it as a body wash and that is it. It did nothing for my clothes or dishes. Once this bottle is gone I will move on to something else.

Extremely drying to the skin do not use if you want to deal with dry skin, even washing my hands this thing sucked the life out of my hands they looked like moisture had been removed on a deeper level. I tried to use it as a dish soap but my dishes started seeing this WHITE residue left on them which was very disconcerting also. The amazingly terrible Amazon.com customer service considers this non returnable and now I'm out $15 because it cannot be returned. Thank you Amazon for making us pay for prime membership to deal with your abysmal customer service.

I'm giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don't appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn't it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I'm returning the product because I don't want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it's a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I'd hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product. [...]

I bought Br. Bronner'castile soap in 3 scents.After started using it,my skin became itchy and dull looking.Before using Dr. Bronner,we were using a different brand,just as healthy but in a bar.On top of my skin issues,I had to scrub my tub after each shower due to the awful residue that this soap was leaving.So,I decided to put it away until a few days ago when I found a dish liquid recipe calling for this soap.I made the soap and all I can say is that again this thing is awful.My dishes and my sink have the same residue as the tub.Love the lavender scent and the fact that is pretty natural,but that's about it.

I have yet to use this product but on initial inspection the packaging is different from the previous times I have purchased this product and the color and consistency seems off. Right of the bat I am not happy but I will update after I use this product.

The viscosity of this soap is too low and as a result it makes a mess if you are used to more typical hand soaps.  I will look for something thicker.

I am usually a night owl and because I intended to do some reading tonight, I decided to take my bath early so that whenever I did get sleepy I wouldn't have to fight sleep to bathe.  So, I took my bath and washed my hair with this stuff at about 6:30...and now?  I am sitting here in front of this computer fighting sleep!  I started getting sleepy about 15-20 minutes ago and was wondering why I was so sleepy and the only thing I could accredit it to (besides another day older) is this product.  Also, although this is my first time using this as a shampoo I haven't noticed any adverse affects yet (I used an organic conditioner as well, so that may play into the hair being softer part of this).  At any rate, if anyone is looking for something to help get to sleep this may actually help, at least it helped this night owl insomniac.  Peace10/06/13 - I had to come back and rewrite this.  After using this product a couple of weeks, I noticed my skin becoming drier and I found that I definitely cannot shave with it; that is entirely too uncomfortable.  The sleep effect has also diminished but that may be because I have started some new ventures and am making myself stay awake to complete projects.  I have started combining a homemade body oil (olive oil and essential oils) along with the product when I bath to relieve some of the dryness, so I'm still using the product.  Although, I will try this brand again, it won't be this particular scent. I couldn't give the product a 2 because I did like it at the start.  Peace

Very versatile soap, which is good, but I found that I'm allergic to not only this Dr. Bronner's soap, but also the Eucalyptus fragrance also. Both made me break out in a very irritated red rash in both my arm pits after just one use of each, and I'm not allergic to anything else! The fragrances of both aren't overly pleasant (even though I normally love a lavender scent). But, it IS concentrated, makes the skin feel soft, will last a long time, and can be used for many different things. I would continue to use them if I weren't allergic to them. Must be one or more ingredients or chemicals in them that did it.

I‚Äôm not even sure why I ordered this product. I think a YouTube creator that I watch gave it a positive review as a body wash. ü§îThe scent is mild. It seems to dry out my skin and it has limited lather. I looked at the other uses and tried it as a dishwashing liquid. It was horrible. This is a huge bottle and I will continue using it until it is gone. If someone has any positive uses, I would love to hear them.

I have used Dr. Bronner's liquid soap for many years now.  I love it.  It's all natural and good for shampoo and as a body wash and so much more.  I usually buy this soap in the health food store.  Usually the smell is wonderful and fills up the bathroom and is very relaxing in the shower.  I couldn't smell  the scent in this soap at all.  I even added a little essential oils to it, and still could not smell it.  The soap worked good, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  These bottles last a long time as it is concentrated and you can cut it 50% with water.  It took me so long to use it up and I was so glad when at last it was finally gone.  Now I buy it at my health food store where it still smells wonderful.

Years ago I used Dr. Bronner's castille soap exclusively for shampoo. I was looking for something lavender-scented and natural, and ordered this. Alas, it not the same: It's  just slightly thicker than water, so when you pour some in your hand, it rolls off like water rather than staying on the hand so you can apply it to your head. I am disappointed, and have decided to simply use it as body wash until it's empty.

I love Dr. Bronner's and have been using this soap for years. I have never had any issues with the soap in the pumps. However, after using the large bottle to refill my pumps, I am constantly having to un-clog the dispenser. I have had soap squirt out all over me because it is so clogged up. I am not sure if the formula is different, but it never occurred until I refilled the bottle with this soap. I still love the scent and product, but it is very frustrating. I think I will just purchase the individual pump bottles in the future. The upside is that they do seem to last much longer than your average soap.

I will not buy from this company again.  The product is fine, and I like the smell.  However, there is a mini sermon all over the bottle's lable.  I find this, not exactly offensive, for I don't have to read the information, and I didn't, but it is certainly aggravating.  I have no problem with anyone's religion; but don't try to shove it in my face.  And doing it this way is just wrong.  Don't make me look at any propaganda in order to use a product.  So, while this a good product, and I'm sure most of their products are, all natural and safe to use, I will find something else.It's a shame that a good product like this is used this way.  A company should let the product speak for itself.Sherrill Schoeffel

The scent is overwhelming and I find this too strong for my skin. I have been trying to use very diluted amounts and my skin gets irritated after use. However I am eczema and skin allergies so if you have normal skin it may work well for you. It leaves my skin feeling very taut and dry. The scent also makes me break out in some hives.This is super good at cleaning my makeup brushes though! So I am keeping it for that. I think I could probably use this to make other types of soaps so I will attempt and report back.

this soap is probably great with a more pleasing scent, but the lavender was not for me.  it didn't smell like lavender to me, and was actually unpleasant.  i had used the peppermint a long time ago, which is strongly scented, but i liked it.  the ingredients are also good in both products.  they are all organic and fairly traded.  i like that the company is conscious of more than just their profit margin!one other thing i thought was suspect was, the consistency (of the bottle i received) was close to that of water.  are they all like that now?  dr. bronner's makes good quality soap, just not the right product for me; i sent it back.

The scent is definitely overwhelming. Showering wise, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. It really dried up my skin and I smelled like the plant, not the nice scented lavender lotions/sprays either lol. I would recommend for cleaning, I used it for mopping and it worked well. But make sure to always measure or else your water will become very sudsy. If I had to rebuy this product, definitely a different scent.

The soap, when used in the shower, is very astringent, good for summer, but not so much, we suspect, in the drying winter months.When used as a dish soap, it left grease residue on plastics; we abandoned it's use for that cleaning function immediately.We may try to use the product one more time in the laundry.

This was 2nd time I bought this product.  The 1st purchase was made 2 years ago.  Comparing 2 purchases' quality, I felt the liquid of 2nd one was not as thicker as the 1st one and the color also is lighter as well.  This is the common circumstance in present consumer product.  Now everything is increasing, but the product price cannot be rose so much, of course, the quality has to be lower to catch the poor profit.

Very good for cleaning around the house. However, I don't suggest using this as a shampoo doesn't smell the way you would want your hair to smell, and when I tried to use it as shampoo I suddenly had hair coming out of my scalp, and not one or two strands. I was scared after that and never tried using it for my hair or skin again. The smell I like pure lavender not the perfume lavender more like earthy smelling stores lavender.

Love the smell and really wanted to love the soap but it fell far short of my expectations. I am still using it for a hand soap (although not great if your hands are really dirty or greasy) but using it as a body wash left the feeling of a film on my body. I also tried the soap as a laundry detergent (again, loved the smell) but for some reason it grows mold in my machine. I have a top-load machine and always leave the lid up after washing but it didn't seem to make any difference, I always get mold growing with this soap. I never had mold before and I'm not getting it now that I quit using this soap.

I got this because people complained about the cheaper brands being watery. I found this to be watery with a strong cologne smell. It definitely doesn‚Äôt smell like lavender. It‚Äôs a nice smell but it‚Äôs really strong. I was expecting a concentrated liquid with a flowery fragrance. I‚Äôm not sure what I got.

Just received this today. It seems fine diluted 4/1 as a hand soap, but that is the only way I have used it so far.I am totally stymied by all the ridiculous religous crap that is written all over the label IN PLACE OF directions for uses of and dilutions of this soap.Some might find this humorous or even inspiring (??); I find it annoying. I had to go online to get ideas about how to use this and how it should be diluted.It remains to be seen, after I have recovered from my initial crankiness, if I will be a real fan. So far, Dr. Bronner himself really turns me off!

I bought  this castile soap thinking am getting at a reasonable price. But I got the shock of my life when I went to HomeGoods store selling Dr.Bronners castile soap and handsoaps half of the price. The product is definitely good but $15+ is way to expensive. Check your nearby stores before you invest your money here.

Lavender did not last long at all ! Compared to the almond. Disappointed with the lack of scent and viscosity of soap.

I tried to use this for cleaning my face, hair, and body... but I felt that it left a weird residue behind (even when diluted). However, last year my son went though a period where he had dangerous breakouts with hives, and this product diluted with water put in a foam pump was the ONLY soap that did not break him out. So if you have allergies this may be an answer to prayers.

Got the Lavender stuff. Works well enough but leaves a film on everything. Some suggest using this stuff for dish soap. Yeah, don't do that. I've used the original plain kind before and don't remember it leaving a film, so maybe the lavender is what's doing it. Either way, I appreciate the simple ingredients approach, but it's just a so-so experience as far as soap goes.

This specific bottle didn't smell like the ones we've used in the past.  It still has a lavender scent, but just smells a bit "off" compared to the bottle we bought from a store. We normally LOVE this soap and scent, but may return it and just buy it from a local store to make sure it doesn't smell funky.

So, I love the product although the bottle is dented and doesn‚Äôt sit up straight in my shower and gets knocked over easily and spills out.

It‚Äôs a good soap I say that because it cleared up my back acne however it dried my skin terribly after a week of using the soap  if you have oily skin it will help you

I love Dr. Bronner's, but find that when I dilute it per directions it does not clean the makeup off my hands.  I have to wash and rinse my hands twice and even then the makeup still comes off on my hand towel.  I'll keep using this and hopefully figure out a way to make it work better - maybe less dilution?

Love this. It's the best. I've bought it before and all went well. Today I received it and cap was broken completely. It wasn't secured or in a bag like it normally is. Thank God it didn't spill 100% but now I have to find a bottle to transfer it to,  Quite annoying!

Probably the better from Dr. Bronner's in terms of scent. A bit drying. I don't trust it to clean my clothes, so I've only used it in the bath. I have a hard time believing it would rinse off my floors after mopping, but it would do in a pinch.

If you've never used Bronner's soap before, all I can tell you is that they're all great.  Go google the documentary about the man.  It's quite interesting.  Now, if you HAVE used their soap before I must tell you that this particular bottle seemed far less potent than those I've normally bought at my local super market.  No idea why.  The lavender is simply not quite as strong smelling.  Odd, but true.

Good stuff, but it seems that the company changed the formula because it doesn‚Äôt lather as well as it used to...Leaves skin dry so kep lotion nearby... I used it for dishwashing as well-eh neh

This probably won‚Äôt bother most people, but I have sensitive skin and this soap made it peel off. Also it was very strong scent. A bit overpowering for me, but may be fine for others.

This order arrived in a box that was leaking the product. It looked as if the box had been bounced. The top of the bottle was dented and the screw cap was leaking the product. I don‚Äôt know where to address this complaint.

Coming from using kiels lavender body wash, which has a ton of chemical ingredients that scared me.  This product lathers up much better and is much cheaper.  However, major drawback is that lavender smell doesn't linger on the body even right after use.

I read the reviews on this and thought it would help with the acne I have developed on my back. Im not sure if maybe I just had a bad reaction to this particular scent but it really dried me out and the next day after use my back was really oily. I love the smell however and feel that it is a good product just not for me.

I really like Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap that comes in the blue container, but I had no idea he had lavender as well. Bought it thinking it was peppermint and it was kind of sickly sweet smelling. Still a good soap but the scent is not very good. Peppermint is better. I gave it to my girlfriend and she likes it so I figure it is ok, not terrible.

Why is this Dr. Bronner‚Äôs so watery?Our family has used this product for over 40 years and it‚Äôs consistently been a thicker formula when bought elsewhere.

Smells good. I used it for my hair. I even diluted it with two cups of water. I'd not recommend this for your hair. But I use it for my body (diluted though) and I think it is a very good option instead of other soaps. Just remember to moisturize your body after using this soap because it dries out the skin a bit.

i don't know. haven't spent too much time working with it. i have been accustomed to traditional soaps (lots of bubbles, smells, etc..) so it is not a very good comparison. now like seventh generation, i don't feel it cleans clothes all that well. i am going to scrub a bit and see what happens. i will update.

I love the ingredients and the way this product can be diluted and used for a variety of purposes but I do not love the film it leaves on my skin. Kind of waxy and heavy. üò•

The ingredients are safe, it lathers nice and it smells really good, but I just can't stand the film it leaves on my sinks and tubs. :-(

I was happy but my kid was completely busted when it arrived at my house so now I have to be careful during storage or it‚Äôs all going to spill.

I had high hopes for using it as a shampoo, but after the third day of wash, my hair felt heavy. Also, my pillow smelled of coconut oil. I now use it in between my regular shampoos.  It suds up a lot so use a little at a time. I also bought the bar which I prefer better than the liquid.

Lovely suds, but too watery to use with my net scrubby, it goes straight through, so I have to use more than I would otherwise have to use.  My shower floor gets very slippery.

I like the smell. I bought it as a shampoo and wasn't very impressed. That being said, it turned out to be a great home cleaner that I feel safe using, so I'm glad my money didn't go to waste.

What I can say about this product is that I'm not allergic to any of the ingredients. Great for the hair, body and cleaning around the house. However it dries my face out like crazy! That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts.

I just give 3 star because of its natural and have a good smell, but in everyday use it hurts your skin

Showered and shaved bikini line with it... but burned terrible in  senstive areas. be very careful of where this winds up going!

I love the scent of lavender, but this product did not smell good to me.  It's medicinal smelling..

It arrived with the cap broken so I hope it doesn't harden or spill. But I've used the product before and it's amazing!

Was okay. Not impressed like the other reviews here. Left a weird residue on things I used to clean with. Does clean make up brushes really well though.

liked it initially but dried me out quickly so i have to start using vegetable glycerin in it.

Good soap but it smells pretty awful. I‚Äôll stick with the almond.

I don't love this Bronner's Castille Soap like I expected. But the natural lavender does smell pretty pleasant, and I love the natural ingredients. The 32 oz. bottle is very large and well priced in my opinion.So far, I've only used the soap as hand soap in previously used pump dispensers. I diluted the solution with warm water, but it always seperates anyway, and you can see the soap pile up at the bottom of the dispenser bottle. One of the bottles I'm using is one from Softsoap. Regardless of what kind of bottle I use, this soap kind of just shoots out at me. Then if I try to shake and mix the contents, the liquid flies out of the dispenser.The castille soap is pretty concentrated, but can be used on its own. It doesn't seem to mix well even when I use warm water like I'm supposed to. I feel like I'm missing something. I guess I just expected it to mix better with water, instead of seperating so easily.I'm hesitant to use the soap for specific DIY products as of now. But I still use it every day, and it cleans very gently. The solution does not dry out your hands, and like I said, it smells nice.

This soap is too strong to use undiluted, but it was not disclosed you need to use preservative when diluting with water for a hand pump. Even very diluted for a foaming pump, it still shriveled up my hands until they were tight, itching and then broke out in a rash. Lotion didn't even alleviate this, so it had to run its course which wasn't a pleasant experience. I got the lavender version and though the smell was very clean, it didn't smell like lavender at all.I commend the efforts of the producers and their use of ethical ingredients. However, more specific instructions need to be provided for people on how to use this very powerful soap. It would save everyone a lot of trouble and money. I know plenty of detergents I'd rather use on my skin than this soap.Update: Since I went from my usual moisturizing soap to this and moving on to other soaps, I found out I'm reacting this way with other soaps as well. I'm upgrading the rating from 2 starts to 4 stars, also because the company contacted me willing to show me some attention on the matter which I never cared to resolve. I still have the soap and can use it for something later. It's very versatile apparently. I still took one off for the smell.

There is one thing that keeps this from perfection: it gets thick and gloppy.This is a very handy product for a person with disabilities: you don't have to worry about having a different bottle of soap for every purpose. It is probably a little difficult for people without physical limitations to understand why this could be such am important issue, But I have learned that when you do have limited mobility, it is best to keep your life as simple as possible. And this product is a lifesaver in that way. I buy one for each sink and bathtub/shower, and leave it at that.I buy the 32 ounce bottles. They are a little heavy and difficult to lift, so I use a pump with them. Even the smallest size is difficult to squeeze, so a tall bottle with the pump works great. And this is where the gloppy part comes in: you get a build up around the pump very quickly, AND it keeps dripping onto the counter. One partial solution is to thin it down with water, but it still gets gloppy. My second solution is to keep a small tray under the nozzle so that I can rinse that very day or so. I wish Dr. Bronner's would come up with their own pump that would work well with their product.

I bought this soap mainly for hand washing, but it dries out and is too strong for my hands with all the continual hand-washing these days of Covid-19. (why only 4-stars). However, it's wonderful for doing dishes, cleaning counters, and all-purpose cleaning-- better than anything I've ever used! --So will wear protective gloves when cleaning with it. The lavender scent is wonderful and soothing; makes cleaning jobs more enjoyable. NOTE: For those complaining about the scent and/or quality of this product-- I contacted the company, and they authorize only 2 sellers on Amazon: Quiverr (which I used), and WishingUWell: "Any other seller on Amazon is not authorized, and therefore we do not guarantee the quality of our products if purchase through unauthorized vendors." So I recommend giving this high-quality, organic product a chance. (I'm not connected with the company and haven't received any compensation for this honest review).

Oh how I love this soap, but I have to agree that its a little thinner than desired. It's great for cleaning things but insufficient as a shower soap.  It didn't suds up too well for me like bath gels do.When I moved to a new apartment we brought my bottle here and cleaned everything from top to bottom. Didn't take much soap at all. It goes far in this way.I was in the hospital for 5 months and unable to properly clean my dreadlocks. It took one wash with this soap and the dreadlocks were back to being clean and fresh. I recommend the soap for dreadlock emergency care :-) and for daily uses such as cleaning floors, counters, cabinets. If you're expecting to shower with this and get a lot of suds and feel all soapy you'll be disappointed. However, the other uses for this make up for it.

I love this stuff! Previously to using it, I only had Lysol and bleach in my house for cleaning everything. I used a lot of chemical varieties and sometimes felt dizzy from the smells. I saw someone using this product on YouTube and was shocked at how such a small amount of product can go such a long way.I bought this bottle over a few months ago and it‚Äôs still almost full, when you dilute it with water a little goes a long way. This is much more economic than buying spray bottles of Lysol and Clorox. It also smells MUCH better- the lavender one is great and fills the space with a subtle but pleasant scent.The only downside is it can leave an opaque film on some surfaces. When this happens I just buff it out with a soft cloth. If not for this I would give 5 stars

This works as a general-use cleaner, and I really like the smell. The lavender smells like actual lavender, not the artificial stuff they put in some candles. One bottle of this lasts for a long time!... But I did buy this because people were saying that it works great as a shampoo. It does not. It's awful as a shampoo. I'm the sort of person who only washes their hair twice a week - often less - and I normally have no problem with oiliness. Using this as a shampoo, however, my hair is oily and gross the next day. I also got some pretty bad dandruff. Hoping that my hair just needed time to get used to it, I used it for a couple weeks. It did not get better. Did the same with my husband's hair. So we switched back to our other shampoo and used this as a cleaner.

I came across this product after what seemed like endless research for a soap that is as natural as possible. The ingredients list is the biggest plus. It has a nice lavender scent, though it does make me sneeze sometimes when I use it in the shower (not sure why). I chose to give it four stars because it is EXTREMELY drying on my skin, even diluted, when otherwise I have normal skin. If I don't moisturize after using this product, my skin gets an itchy, tightening feeling--this doesn't happen when I use any other soap. Almost feels as drying as dish soap! (My hands get the same rough whiteness between the knuckles with this product as it does after exposure to dish soap.) If you're going to use this product on your skin, just make sure to moisturize afterward! Aside from that, it's great, and really puts my mind at ease knowing it doesn't contain harmful chemicals. I definitely recommend it.

I love cleaning with this. It removes grime without destroying the integrity of the surface being cleaned. It is multipurpose as well. Good for sensitive skin.

Love this brand. Clean products. Smell was ehh okay great for cleaning product use or even as laundry detergent replacement. But not the smell for shower. Well at least for me I didn‚Äôt like it. Too strong. But also very drying remember this okay. Maybe dilute it more. Idk

I bought this to use in my soap foam pump. I put it in to the soap fill line (about 2 oz), and then filled it the rest of the way with water (about 10 oz). Shake it up thoroughly and it appears to be uniformly mixed and kind of cloudy. The next morning, I see that the cloudiness has all settled in the bottom forming a cloudy layer up to the soap fill line. It appears that this soap doesn't remain dissolved in water. Isn't that the whole point of soap?I like that it leaves my hands feeling really clean, with only the scent of the lavender and no other hint of residue on my hands. But I don't want to use it because I'm afraid that whatever causes the cloudiness is going to clog up the foamer. I guess I'll put it in a squeeze bottle and use it in the kitchen.

Love the product, but EVERY TIME I order, it comes with a busted cap, leaks all over the box and wasted! Won't be buying again!

I have used Dr. Brommer  Castile soap for years, but I do not use it on my person. I keep some in a  recycled spray bottle by the sink and use it when I want to give an extra boost in cleaning dishes or pans. If it squirts up just put your open hand on top so it hits your palm. Or put the sponge or washcloth on top of it and it will not squirt in your face. I also wipe the sink with it and sometimes I add to the washing machine for  stubborn stains. I occasionally use some with my shampoo. For me it works very well in all the ways that I need.

Really strong scent- I don't love that. I prefer the unscented. I use it for my hair way diluted. I only wash my hair twice a week, that is really all that is needed with castile soap because it doesn't strip all your natural oils. It does take a few weeks for your hair and scalp to adjust- during that time just wash it with a silicone free conditioner. Once it adjusts it is so great to only have to shampoo twice a week. Follow with a conditioner or vinegar- something with an acid.  It lasts a really long time because you dilute it so much.

Use it on my entire body and my residual limb as well as my prosthetic liners. I'm not particularly fond of the scent not terrible just wish it was more pleasant.

Dr. Bronner's can be super expensive.  This is the better price I've seen so far.  We used to buy it in the gallon, but have not recently found any good prices on that.  This is the soap I use in the shower and in my foaming hand soap containers (where you only need about a TB or so and the rest water in a foaming hand soap dispenser).  It is gentle on our skin, contains natural ingredients, doesn't coat the shower, cleans well, and smells great.

Over time this irritated my skin. I‚Äôll try unscented next time.

Would not recommend to use on faceLavender scent could be a little stronger and longer lasting, otherwise it‚Äôs okay

I have been using Bronners for 2yrs now & I don‚Äôt see myself going back anytime soon! I use for my body, laundry, hair & face . I absolutely love this product & how clean I feel every use . But, beware it leaves your skin very dry so a nice moisturizer you will need . Overall forever customer .

Love the way it smells and its multi-purpose use! However, I would not recommend it as a shampoo even after diluting it unless you have a very dry scalp/hair.

Dr. Bronners: Come for the crazy packaging, stay for the amazing scented soap.  I use this as bath aromatherapy and to clean ear piercings (which is how I got introduced to it in the first place--try adding some to some water in a glass eyedropper bottle--it gets cool and refreshing, and easy to apply with the dropper). I do find it a bit drying to use for a daily soap, but there's not much better than squirting a bit in a hot bath and breathing in the lavender.

It dries the hand similar to any other soap. But the scent is lovely. A small amount mixed with water gives an excellent foaming soap. Use a foaming dispenser as this will not work well with regular soap dispensers.

For now its the only soap that I've used that doesn't  throw off my V ph balance, scent isn't overpowering, I would recommend, sorry my review is a bit generic, Idk what to say, it works for me

This stuff is the way to go if you need something biodegradable. I use it for camping and it does the trick for hair, body and we even wash dishes with it. I have tried the peppermint and found the tingling sensation to be a bit much, but otherwise it's good too. I wouldn't use it for an everyday because it does feel like it leaves a bit of residue behind, but not bad at all.

I've been using Dr. Bronner's lavender soap for years. I have sensitive skin that reacts badly to scents and chemicals. This soap works fine for me, no irritation whatsoever. It works good, doesn't dry your skin out, or leave you with a greasy feeling. I like that there are no petro-chemicals in the product, or artificial dyes or scents.

The smell of the lavender scent is awful. I wish I could return for the peppermint. Disappointed

I GOT IT OFF EBAY AWHILE BACK AND IT WAS PACKAGED WELL... BUT FROM AMAZON OR WHATEVER ONE CAME WITH A BROKEN CAP AND THE PLASTIC SEAL.HAD A HOLE... BECAREFUL IF U DECIDE TO BUY....

I've had this bottle for over a year and I have barely used up a quarter. I use it to make foaming hand soap and I'm docking a star because  sometimes it feels like there is a residue that doesn't wash away.

I really like the scent of this product since I am a fan of anything lavender.  After reading many other reviews I decided to check out Trader Joe's and Wholefoods.  Found it at both stores for $11.99 for the 32 ounce bottle.  Hmmm...I haven't used it for all the ways others mention, but expect I will experiment sometime.  A 32 ounce bottle lasts me a very long time.

This was my first time trying to lavender. It ok, I prefer the peppermint Dr Bronner's. It will get you squeaky clean and you only need a little dab. This one was okay the scent isn't overwhelming and but I like the refreshing feel and clean of the peppermint.

Nice scent. The packaging is a bit much. If you order it you‚Äôll know what I mean. Ok soap, gets the job done and it‚Äôs all natural and safer than those chemically charged drug store soaps. Would purchase again poss in a diff scent.

I was not aware that many people have an allergy to Lavender before I bought this.  It smells nice, works well, but many people do have an allergy, and I developed a contact dermatitis after using it.  \My sister in law is a physician, and I called her after using it because I was pretty sure I had to have gotten scabies from a patient.  No scabies, just a soap allergy, and allergies to lavender are common!  But if you are not allergic, go for it =)

I love this soap - you only need a little bit for it to do its job, and it smells wonderful, too. My only complaint is with the packaging of this item. Amazon simply threw it into a box. The top of the bottle came loose and the soap was starting to spill out down the side of the bottle and into the box. The top really needs to be protected with tape or something so it doesn't come loose in transit.

Love this soap but it really dried out my skin. I thought I had some medical issue for a few years until I just switched to something else.

I've been using Dr. Bronner's in place of shower and shave gel for a while now, but this was my first time buying the hemp lavender.  It does its job and smells nice, but I won't buy this particular one again just because of the label.  The purple dye on the label of the bottle ran in the shower and stained it.  It was hard as heck to get off!  None of the other scents have done this.

The smell is super strong and smells exactly like a lavender flower which I do not mind at all, but if you do not like strong scents I would NOT recommend this soap.

I like it, but I really wish the consistency was thicker. Super thin, almost like water.Overall, I recommend. I have sensitive skin, and I have had no problem using this. I use for homemade shampoo, hand soap, body wash, etc.

When received, cap broken and spill. Not shippers fault, do believe. Too much of a hassle to return. Decanted and put in another container.

The soap is great! However, it does not leave me with the mint like sensation some of the other scents do.

Too thin, but it's vegan, so I bought it, because one of the few soaps without animal ingredients. I used this to make soap which was a fail. I would not buy it to use it directly as a hand soap.

Great product for my body. However, it has a tendency to dry my face. Other than that, great product.

I don't like to use this as soap but I do like to use it for stinky laundry (it's too $$ to use for all laundry) and for hand washing.

This soap has a great scent but is very watery. That isn‚Äôt a big problem but I‚Äôm used to thicker soap. Love the scent though.

My young daughter has eczema from our harsh water. In tandem with less baths and only using this product her eczema has almost disappeared. Delivery was very fast, we ordered and received this the next day! Dr. Bronners can be used for a variety of household tasks and I'm hoping to buy a variety of scents for the whole house soon.

Wonderful smell and great value! Be cautious of using this on your hair, but I use it on my body and as a hang soap- use it diluted!

First time trying this soap, unfortunately it came with the cap broken :(

I started using this stuff for aftercare on a piercing and quickly became addicted to it.  I use it in the shower for body and hair, then use the Dr. Bronner's conditioning cream after washing my hair.  It smells great and gets you nice and clean without stripping hair and body of moisture.

This is a pretty good deal on Dr. Bronners.  It is not too lavendery smell but is refreshing.  It does not give that tingle feeling that the peppermint provides.

Smell good leave your skin feeling soft.

This soap is great as you need minimal amount to shower. It suds easily and have a strong lavender scent. Keep this in mind and use sparingly.

I purchased this because I read an article suggesting that mixing a bit of  this soap with water and using it to spray my plants would keep gnats and other bugs away.  Well to my great surprise and delight this product goes way beyond my greatest expectations!  A few of the things I have used it for:1.  Shower,/ bath - wonderful, leaves skin soft , silky and smelling great!2.  Best shampoo I have ever used!  My hair has never been so soft and shiny!  Many compliments, people actually noticed the difference.3.  Works well for my dogs bath also, squeaky clean, soft and shiny also.4.  General cleaning, kitchen, bathroom etc.  cleans very well and smells wonderful.5.  Had some fungus stuff growing in my outdoor rock garden damaging my plants - so sprayed it generously and it was all shriveled up and had turned black by the next morning!6.  Clean dentures - rinse well!7.  Brush teeth with, rinse very well, teeth feel very clean and less plaque build up.  This takes some getting use to but it works like a charm.I only received the product a few days ago , I can't begin to tell you how impressed I am with it.  I ordered the lavender and did dilute before using as the instructions suggest.  I will be ordering other scents soon.  I am extremely pleased with this product.

A comment on the company and label first. For years I was picking up products from Dr. Bronner's, looking at the label, and thinking it was some strange "Santavoodoo" cult thing and putting it back on the shelf. Then I came across a reference to the company in another context and read all about the background and it is actually a great story from the history of a very ethical company. The original Dr. Bronner had some "unique" thoughts about what ails the world and the label reflects some of those thoughts. It's more in the model of eccentric self enlightenment than strange cult, the essence of which is that people need to love more in life. Today the grandson runs the company ‚Äî with much love ‚Äî and maintains the labels as a homage as well as all the customers want the original version. The grandson at one point tried simplifying the label and all the dedicated customers complained, loudly!It seems the reviews from all the different scents get shoved into this one list. Be aware that there are six or eight scents and you are likely not going to like ALL of them, but many do like them all. There is also an unscented version if you are sensitive to fragrances. All the fragrances are based on natural essential oils though so they don't use the many chemical recreations of a natural fragrance. No need to pan the entire product line if you run into a scent you don't like.I usually dilute the soap down with three parts water and put it in a foaming dispenser for sink side use. It makes a very rich and luxurious foam. You can buy the foaming dispensers on Amazon. I've just started using it in the shower as well full strength on a wash cloth. I'm liking it in the shower now because it rinses easily and leaves no soap residue. I have sensitive skin and left over soap will give me rashes so usually I have to spend an inordinate amount of time rinsing. Now not so much with Dr. Brenner's in the shower.I like all the scents, though the lavender seems to be getting poor reviews. You should be aware that there are two types of lavender scent that you can get generally depending upon what part of the lavender plant is processed. One is a floral scent that comes mainly from the buds and flowers which many associate with English or French lavender. The other is a more resinous scent that smells medicinal to many which comes from the other parts of the plant. The floral scent is of course more treasured because there is less of it distilled from the plant. The Dr. Bronner's Lavender is a perfect rendition of the resinous scent ‚Äî which I actually prefer because I don't especially like strong floral smells.All the various versions are good though! Except the rose for me which is a scent that I would never even try. Rose / Geranium Oil is like nails on a chalkboard to me.

The only soap I use for my shower and hair.  Great stuff.

Use for laundry

Have used it for years.

this stuff is freaking amazing! never using anything else as my bath wash

I use this soap to mix neem oil, cleaning and personal hygiene.

Cleans like no other!

It‚Äôs gentle on my hands

I love it. My favorite

UPDATED 121414: Well, in the year since I first posted this comment, I have tried a few different liquid castile soaps, including Bronner's and MountainRoseHerbs. My initial dislike of the castile soaps has changed. I mistook lack of viscosity for insufficient concentration.Although castile soaps are VERY watery compared to the thickness of the chemically processed store soaps, it is by no means deficient as a 'concentrate'.I've found that even by a ratio of 4 to 1 (4 parts water to 1 part castile) I have more than sufficient soapy lather reaction for hand-washing or bathing (I also add baking soda to my bath soap container). I use a soap 'foamer' for hand-washing at my bathroom and kitchen sinks, and it has worked out very well - and without gunking up the foamer mechanism.I don't really care for castile though for washing dishes or laundry, as it builds a film over time - even with a bit of baking soda added.(I'm currently still using a 'chemically manufactured' laundry soap - ECOS. EWG.org only gives it a 'C' score (A,B,C,D,F). I'm only using about one and half tablespoons (with 1/2 cup baking soda) per load. But until my circumstances change (financially) or I come across another (truly) natural solution that works 'for me', I'm kinda stuck with that right now.)This past year has been a real learning - and eye-opening - experience for me. I've discovered soapberries (favorite as my shampoo), and soapwort, in addition to castile. While I use Bronner's (and feel confident to recommend them) in a pinch, my preference is MRH's castile.Anyway, along the way, I've become more convinced than ever as to the danger of chemicals/toxins/pesticides in our products and environment, and equally, more committed to changing the 'way' I 'live' and 'how' I do things. Guess I am (very) happily joining the tree-hugger and ecology-freak ranks for sure.So, the bottom line, check out Dr. Bronner's soaps, but keep in mind that soaps like this 'are' different from the chemically processed soaps available in retail. Bend a little in your 'expectations' and you might be pleasantly surprised.And, fwiw to those who 'do' care - always check out your ingredients at EWG's products database (even some of Dr. Bronner's, in the past, haven't scored very well - but seem to be genuinely committed). EWG has also recently launched a mobile app to help 'on-the-spot' in the store.********Wow. This soap is so thin that it pours like water; it has no viscosity whatsoever.I'm divided as to how well I like it as a soap. My extremely sensitive facial skin reacted like I was using hot peppers. However as a body wash, it wasn't too bad; my skin felt a little 'tight', and only a wee bit itchy, afterwards but nothing that on that score would send me back to the use of toxic soaps that fill our shopping shelves. Also, fwiw, the location where I'm currently using this soap uses a 'water softner'. It is very possible that this might be a mitigating effect in my skin's response to the qualities of this soap. (My sensitive skin reacts to even the slightest changes in tap water that isn't filtered.)I have not yet tried it as a shampoo, so I am not yet able to offer my experience there, but may perhaps edit my review should I try the shampoo experiment.I did find the lavender smell from the essential oil to be a bit overpowering, which seemed a bit ironic since the soap solution seemed so watered down. Another reviewer mentioned that this same soap sold at Walgreens was of thicker consistency, so I might give it another whirl and buy it from them. Otherwise it's not worth the price it's currently selling for (about $16+).In all honesty, for me, I think I'll probably just stick with my soap nuts soap, since they've been SO great for my sensitive skin, scalp 'and' hair. They're a little more 'trouble' (distilling the liquid soap), but, again, for me, well worth the effort.

I am absolutely thrilled with Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap (Lavender, 32 ounce)! This soap has become an essential part of my daily routine. I use it with my exfoliate hand scrubber, and it consistently leaves my skin feeling clean and rejuvenated without any oily residue.

Finally something that has fair practices, doesn't test on animals, has a great mind set about life and that can be used for cleaning everything without any allergic side effects. I use this for everything, from laundry, to washing the dishes, to cleaning the whole house, to washing my body and hair with it. It depends how much you use it. I use very little of it since a few drops is sufficient enough. I use only 3-4 dime size drops to do heavy large laundry and 2 dine size drops for smaller laundry. One drop for my hair and 2 drops in a small bin to wash my body. 3 drops in a spray bottle to do house cleaning, including cleaning the bathroom. The stuff lasts for a long time. Very concentrated so I know that for some people it may be too strong of a smell.The way to combat this is by adding more water. I got the lavender smell, because it scares away the bugs. Ever since I started to use this, no more roaches in the bathroom, bedroom or any place in which I use this at. I had this 32 ounce bottle for two months now and I only use 3-4 ounces of the stuff. Normally I have to spend so much money for detergents, dish washing soaps, soaps, shampoo, window cleaners, etc due to my sensitive skin and some of this stuff isn't strong enough to clean so I have to use more of it... Dr Bronner ended the hassle of buying so much stuff for cleaning. One bottle... that is all, so I save money and space. I love the fact that this company is very philosophical and it practices what it believes in. It is organic, Fair trade/practices, pays its employees fairly, doesn't test on animals, made in the USA, so much more. I would want to try the other smells to make a decision on which one will be my gallon bottle. I imagine the gallon bottle will last me the whole year.

I have very itchy, dry, and sensitive skin. Before this product, I was not sleeping well because of the incredible discomfort. I tried a slew of products to try and quell the itching / dryness to no avail.  The first time I used this product (as body wash) I felt instantly relieved. It has this cooling feeling on the skin.  It is difficult to describe: sortof like bathing in the dead sea but feeling clean & refreshed afterward. It also is incredibly soothing for mosquito bites, cuts, etc. It is a miracle product that healed an infected skin rash (I know, gross).  I mentioned that just to illustrate its efficacy. I rarely praise a product to such a degree, but Dr. Bronner's deserves it! I love that it is multi-purpose. I use it as shampoo, body & face wash (warning below...) It has done wonders for my skin & hair.WORDS OF CAUTION: It excruciatingly burns if you get this in your eyes! More so than "regular" soap so be very careful when using as shampoo or face wash.

I use it and the peppermint one to clean up after the cat, and for cleaning anything stinky

Feel super clean

I have eczema that has gotten progressively worse over the past few years no matter what I have put on my skin. I have very long hair and noticed that the eczema is especially bad where my hair hits the skin on my back and shoulders. I came upon this product while looking for a better shampoo. I have tried different lotions and treatments, sulfate-free shampoo and other things that are supposed to be good for my eczema to no avail. The product labels alone are enough to give me anxiety. So many chemicals! My skin felt terrible and my hair felt greasy and my eczema was still awful.I have been using this product for shampoo/body soap/shaving/hand soap. I have had it for less than a week and I already feel a difference. My hair feels great and I do not need a conditioner after using the product as shampoo. I don't need to apply as much lotion (I have purchased an organic lotion without a bunch of chemicals as well) as my skin feels softer. I will update after using for a month or so. My eczema is so bad that it is going to take a while for it to heal. I made little sample bottles of this product for my friends. I am going to be a Dr. Bronner's pusher! :)I also have used it to clean the bathroom and am very happy with the results. The scent makes me happy as well. Do yourself a favor and try this. You won't need another soap ever.

All natural! No obnoxious fragrances! Doesn't dry out your skin! Cleans surprisingly better than most other soaps, and I'm mean for blue collar stuff like automotive grime. Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. Be sure to pick up a foaming pump dispenser. It will clog a traditional dispenser because it doesn't contain any anti-coagulant chemicals :) I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things. I hope this review helps sell a lot of soap. Enough to get my local grocer to carry it ;) Maybe even enough to drive the price down a little. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.

Best natural soap. Recommended!

This soap has everything you need and then some: a harmless, natural soap, great scent, good price, nice bubble bath, and mosquitoes hate it!  Summer before last I realized I‚Äôd had relatively few bites, which was pretty unusual.  In thinking back on what I might have changed, using this soap was the only thing I‚Äôd changed.Last summer was the worst one we‚Äôve had in awhile, for mosquitoes, and this was great for being outdoors.  I normally get terrible bites but, with this soap, I ended up with little or none.  Just poured a little in my hands, added a few drops of water, and patted into skin and clothes for a second.  We had an outdoor get together and all of our guests used it.  A great product, and I use it year round.

This high quality body wash is both refreshing and exceptionally effective.

I first tried Dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint soap at an Airbnb I stayed at. I bought a 2 pack at Costco and it literally lasted me years. I use it mostly in the shower- for soap/shaving. I also used the peppermint as a veggie wash. (You can use it for everything, but those are my main uses) Finally ran out & decided to try this scent. No regrets! A nice change for the shower. I know it‚Äôll last me probably a year or longer, but I look forward to trying even more scent options. Either way, I can‚Äôt believe I lived without this soap for so long! Drops go a long way!

the manufacturer, dr bronner‚Äôs,  makes a time tested and excellent soap.WishingUwell, the seller, does a horrific job of packaging for shipping.a 32 ounce bottle loose inside a lightweight cardboard box twice the size it needs to be with no padding is a recipe for a shipping disaster.box arrived with a hole torn in it from the bottle tolling around inside with zero packing material.the hole was big enough for bottle to fall out of‚Ä¶ in fact i temoved bottle from box without opening carton on arrival.awesome soap manufacturer.lousy packing by seller.

Comparative shopping to brick-and-mortar stores this size and product are comparative pricing. Even less expensive by a dollar or more.What I like most about this soap is evening use. The scent relaxes me and soothes my skin. Partnered with Nourish Organic Lavender Mint Body Lotion assist me to transition to a calm peaceful night's rest.This size lasts me many months. Including hand use in a jar dispenser.I highly recommend this company for its business practices. Plus, love the unique bottle covering. Fun interesting browsing while soaking in the claw tub.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èAs I recommend other scents and in-scented.

Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps Pure Castile Soap in Lavender is one of the best all-purpose soaps I have ever used. I made a batch of homemade laundry detergent with the soap, which consisted of two cups of the liquid castile soap, half cup of baking soda and a liter of sea salt water with about twenty-drops of lavender essential oil. Then, I simply combine these ingredients together in a large mason jar and stir the ingredients together well. Then, when I want to use the homemade laundry detergent, I pour a cup into each load of laundry and let the homemade laundry detergent do it's thing. Sure enough it cleansed the laundry extremely well leaving it smelling fresh and clean.I have also used this soap as dish soap for cleansing the dishes and it cuts grease and food particles from the dishes well. It also works wonders as a hand soap cleanser, shampoo, relaxing body wash and bubble bath, as well as shaving oil. I even take a half cup of the solution and mix it with a liter of vinegar to create a household cleansing product to help cleanse surfaces down in my house naturally.

Recently, I've been trying to stay away from harsh chemical cleaners and have been experimenting with some natural castile soap.  I've seen Dr. Bronner's brand before in Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and the like.  I decided to give this lavender and hemp castile soap a try.  When this product arrived in the mail I quickly looked up how to dilute and use this soap.  I got an empty spray bottle from the store and took 1/4 cup of Dr. Bronner's soap and filled the rest of the bottle with water.  Once the soap and water are mixed, you can then go ahead and use this as a cleaner.  I've used this product on my furniture (tables, desks, etc), kitchen, bathroom, and I think the uses you can get out of this soap are endless, plus at 32 oz., you'll get a great value from this purchase.  I have only used one (2) spray bottle since I bought this item and it was around 9 months ago and am currently starting my second bottle.  I cannot recommend this brand enough!

Dr. Bronner's Castile Lavender soap smells good and cleans everything I have tried it on.  Rinses well too.  I read all the information on the bottle with a magnifying glass because the print is so small.  This soap works best when diluted.  That is important just like other reviewers said.  I did not dilute it the first time I washed my hands and didn't like it so much so I tried different dilutions for cleaning, bathing, and shampooing.  Much better performance.  This bottle will last a long time.  Half filtered water and half soap is the one I use most frequently.  I keep small squirt bottles of diluted soap at each sink and in the shower.  I get lots of lather when shampooing and find I do need a conditioner on my shoulder-length hair.  Chrome faucets are sparkling with no soap scum.  Removes skin oils and leaves 14K gold jewelry sparkling too.  Recommend this and plan to try the other fragrances.

This soap has made my life just so much better. My skin is now as soft and evenly toned as I've always wanted it to be and I'm getting it done without the use of harsh and unnecessary chemicals. But as a toothpaste this stuff really made my day. My mouth feels clean and fresh and there's no toxic fluoride! I even had a periodontal condition in my mouth where the gum line beneath my two front bottom teeth was receding, this is the whole reason I bought the stuff in the first place, and it turned out to be a total blessing because not only are my gums returning to normal my teeth are getting whiter after just about a week of usage. I was worried that I was going to have to see a doctor and being an American without health insurance, the health care I would've subscribed to  would have financially devastated me and probably have not even worked. If you have sensitive skin/gums/scalp you should really give this soap a try. I used it in my laundry too to avoid the usage of chemical detergents. I hate chemicals! You should try this soap. Or gift it to someone who you think could benefit. They'd love you for it!

Once upon a time, a girl turned the lovely age of 29. Her skin decided to freak out and get super sensitive and, for once in her life, she started to suffer from break outs. Flash forward 3 years and I'm still struggling... until this soap came along. I had always heard that Castile Soap is super gentle. I'm also a sucker for lavender.True to its nature, it IS very gentle. I use it as body wash and face wash. For my face, I use a little bit with my Clarsonic face brush and after a couple of days, I noticed my skin clearing. I've been using it for two weeks now and my face is clear and my skin isn't drying out. I even use it as shampoo once a week as I have found that it does a great job at removing build up. I can't say enough GREAT things about this soap.The consistency is very different. It's more of a free flowing liquid so be careful when putting it on your rag or poof. :)

Love this soap- I've been using it for at least 15 years. It is natural, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and smells great with only natural essential oil fragrance. We usually get the lavender but I also really like the almond one. Peppermint is ok too but a little strong/tingly for bathing use for me. My best tip: this soap works well as a hand soap, but is best in a "foamer" dispenser - if used in a regular dispenser it gets gummed up regularly and will sometimes come shooting out at an impressive pace and distance, which can get soap on clothes or walls, etc. Consider yourself warned :)I also think using the foamer dispenser makes it last longer and reduces the risk of clogging the drains, which this soap has a tendency to do over time. It would be awesome if Dr. Bronner's made a foamer pump that could fit on the caps of the larger bottles for shower use...

I don't write to many reviews - I should - but I had to rave about this product. Some time back my daughter turned me on to this product as we are looking to replace chemicals wherever we can. We are organic vegan/plant based and have been reducing our carbon footprint for the the past year. I have used this soap for dishes and occasionally cleaned the porcelain sink. Today I was trying to find a way to clean the rings in the toilet bowl. Everyone recommended Borax and either vinegar, lemon juice, or making a paste. I tried all and had zero positive results. I finally grabbed the soap, a sponge and with some elbow effort, I had three toilet bowls sparkling. Absolutely the most amazing product I have ever cleaned with and now we can continue to remove chemicals. Next up is the shower doors which take forever with vinegar and baking soda - I am expecting the same success and reduce the workload for me and my spouse - thank you Dr Bronner !!!!!

Awesome!!!!

Cannot beat the shine on linoleum with 1/8 cup of this soap! Love it for cleaning, insect eggs on plants, hand soap, homemade laundry soap scent and cleaner, etc etc etc. I should buy stock in this castille soap. I love lavender scent, always smells like clean to me and soothes the system at the same time! I cannot understand the use of nasty chemicals when Dr. Bronner Castille Soap can do so much without them! I get the baby formula when not wanting scented cleaners or uses. Organic repellant on my herbs is once use for baby/unscented version and if you have sensitive skin individuals, well isn't it obvious? It should be. Good price point on Amazon as well. Mr Bezos needs to pay his employees better and upgrade working environment for all these people who give him so much and make my life much easier!

Part of my cleaning mixture

This is probably the best relaxing soap I have owned in years. I have the Dr. Bronner Peppermint Castile Soap which is great for the morning. It really helps wake you up with its tingly sensation. But there is nothing better then taking a hot shower before bed and using Dr. Bronner Lavender Castile Soap. Its very calming, has a great lavender scent, and leaves your skin feeling soft. I also use it on my face, dishes, and more. Its really an all purpose soap. They aren't joking when they say 18 uses, and more. I've also tried it in my hair. It is drying. There are some reviews out there where people say its not. They must have very oily skin/hair. Because I've found it to dry my hair. However, it does get all the oil out. After the gym Ill wash my hair with Bronner's soap first, then use my regular shampoo after. Then apply conditioner. Seems to be the best way to use it without drying your hair. I would defiantly get the 32 oz over any size. Seems to be the perfect size for multi uses. I've also price checked, and this was the best price I found anywhere.

I used to have to use lotion on my shoulders after showering because my old body wash was quite harsh. I've only used this.. I think 3 times now? My shoulders are already doing much better and I don't *need* to use the lotion.This stuff leaves me feeling incredibly clean. It lathers great. It's gentle, but very strong at the same time.Only downside is I wish it had a pump lid, otherwise I love everything about it. I totally understand not having a pump lid though. The container seems to be about minimizing its carbon footprint, which I can respect.Highly recommend. So far the best body wash I've ever used.

I cannot talk enough about Dr. Bronner's products and once you use them , you don't stop. Great variety, lasts forever and rinses clean from everything! I was in a car accident 10 years ago where I was ejected from a vehicle and I lost 40% of the skin on my back side. After the skin graphing and hospital stay, I was sent home with not much to heal the physical scars from the damage except for time. A friend recommended Dr. Bronner's Lavender - Between the oils and extracts all their soaps contains and the clean rinse, I soaked every night before bed and my scars healed amazingly! In addition, the lavender was soothing and relaxing after being in so much pain and stress. I still use this everyday with no over drying on the skin. I even use some of the other classic and organic varieties for everything from vegetable washing to doing my laundry! I swear - I don't work for the company but I wished I did! I'm just a simple hippie with simple tastes and I know what I love - Dr. Bronner!!!

The Dr. Bronner's line of soaps are the best for multiple uses.  We use the peppermint variety, the tea tea variety and the lavender.  The initial Castile smell may be a little off putting but the results of these washes makes that a non-issue overall.  This soap can be used for laundry, dishes, hair and body wash.  I especially love an evening bath/shower with the lavender to help me relax for sleep and in the morning the peppermint is so great and revitalizing.  I do not recommend daily washing for your hair, it does make my hair dull but I do not wash my hair but twice a week anyway.  My son uses the peppermint to brush his teeth.  Lotion and or moisturizers after washing I find necessary because I tend to have dry skin but for my youngest who has oily skin the wash is perfect.  If you give this a try and find the little tweaks to make it work for you it is a product I can highly recommend.  Netflix has a great documentary about Dr. Bronner.

Soothing, clear, clarifying, and prevention of secondary infections for cancer patients....this is a favorite good to product...I will continue to use after all my cancer treatment is complete...I started using this in 1985,when my mom had cancer, we bought it by the gallon, because of the price, there were 14 people in our house and the gallon would run out in 3-4 months...we are all shower people...but time and relocation prevents me from doing this...Plus price is a big factor 1gallon is no longer under $20 then add tax...but I am back...regardless of the size bottle that I purchase, plus I can not expose myself to germs and many people, Amazon has solved that problem...May 4oz bottle has last since May... I shower twice a day, with two or more touch ups throughout the day...a little goes a very long way...I have given all my other (40bottles+) of shower gels and junk to my daughter and when she is finished with those, I will show her how to use Dr. Bonners...

You've gotta love Dr. Bronner's products -- every scent I've tried is wonderful.  I use it to cleanse my face, my bathroom fixtures, a spill on my carpet, etc.I did not believe the reviews when I first read them -- how could one cleanser actually work for every cleaning application?  Well, I was determined to find out and have been a consumer of Dr. Bronner's ever since.  It really is a wonderful product.  Now, if you're using it as a facial cleanser, you should start with small amounts and just let your skin and your senses (the scents are very vibrant) get used to it.  After a few uses you will be acclimated to it and your skin will thank you.  I always follow up with a gentle, non-scented moisturizer as I have delicate skin.

I use Dr Bronner's to wash my body, from head to toe! It's the only shampoo and soap I'll use. It's great to know you're not smearing chemicals all over your body.I know some people may scoff at the price (currently $16 for 32 ounces), but a little goes a long ways. I am a man, with short hair, and I use right at a tablespoon of soap for a complete shower.I recommend this soap to anyone who wants an all natural way to cleanse their body. It's the only brand I plan on buying, for the rest of my life.I'm partial to the lavender and peppermint scents. The peppermint also makes a great cooling shave foam. Just put a few drops in your palm, rub until the soap foams, and apply to your wet face.

This is my first experience with Dr. Bronner's, and really like it. Very strong lavender scent. So far have used it as a hand soap, and as an indoor and outdoor shower soap. Much prefer this to any other liquid soap I've tried in the past. Per other reviews, I dilute it with water. The right consistency for me is an equal amount of water - not slimy soapy, rather watery, which lathers up beautifully. This quart size seems a great value, considering I'll get two quarts of liquid soap out of it when I mix it with water.  Paid 18.99 for it Amazon Prime. Saw it at target for 15.99

I clean my house with 'clean' products. I use baking soda and vinegar to clean most things. However, as I've been working on recipes for clothes soap. I've found the best recipe does include a little of Dr. Bronner's lavender castile soap. The little bit of lavender scent leaves in the dryer and yet there's enough of it in the clothes after washing that I don't have to use a dryer sheet in the dryer.I do have a recipe for clean dryer sheets, I just haven't needed to use them since I started making this clothes washing recipe.Highly suggest!

I originally bought this soap as a recommendation from a friend who is organic everything. I decided to give it a try. Although the price is steep, it is definitely worth it. You don't need to apply much onto a loofa to have it lather, for just a handful of drops can wash your entire body. I am not the tallest man, so it takes less soap to wash my body haha. I don't have any complaints with this soap. It leaves me feeling fresh every time I use it and I buy one about once or twice a year, so it definitely is worth buying one or two a year instead of constantly having to buy soap once a month or something. I even found that with after some use, I don't have to apply deodorant for up to four hours after use! I save money on deodorant as well. Score! Btw: don't buy from Duane Reade. They rip you off.

I use this soap for my shampoo, for my laundry detergent , my body wash , for mopping the floors, even my hand soap! There are infinite numbers of things this soap can be used for which make it even better than amazing! I will continue to support Dr. Bronners until the day i die and mark my words! For so many organic oils all combined together to create a universal soap , where exactly can you go wrong? Even if you think its so expensive, its really not considering that you have to dilute it with water for just about everything you use it for! If you don't dilute the soap it can possibly have serious chemical reactions which is dangerous! So dont forget to dillute , and once you see that when you dilute it , you end up with just as much soap as you would with any normal chemical soap , and what do you know , its organic ;)

Dr. Bronner's soap is the best. It is pricey but works so well. I always feel super clean after using it (especially the tea tree which has antiseptic qualities). The lavender smells great and is more gentle than tea tree on the skin and to the nose. I use both -mostly tea tree in the shower for my body and lavender at the sink for face and hand washing. If you have more sensitive skin, lavender is better but overall Dr. Bronner's soap is rather strong for very sensitive skin, so you may have to dilute it. As a face and hand soap, I dilute it with water but I use a little straight up on a wash cloth in the shower.

After reading the many reviews of this product; I was concerned that it was going to be a diluted version.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  I prefer to shower with it; it does leave me squeaky clean without drying my skin and has been an immense relief to some itching I had developed throughout my body.  Using this as shower gel has given me much soothing help and I truly enjoy the freedom from the irritation other shower gels had given me before.  --  Seeing previous reviews that said the same product bought at Sprouts was thicker and longer lasting; I was able to find it on sale and bought a bottle same size, same scent ...  Both soaps are identical, one is not thicker than the other and both provide the same soothing relief ...  Will definitely continue to order this...

Excellent

I have been using Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Pure-Castile Liquid Soap for two years now. I used to use it for all the cleaning at my home until I read a review that talked about getting bad smell out of clothes. My small kid has bathroom accidents, many times. I try to wash his clothes right away but somethings I have to leave stuff until next day. Things smells bad, I tried other specific soaps, baking soda, leave clothes under the sun, you name it. Then I tried this soap and strong and bad smells are gone.This is a great product!

UPDATE : AFTER LEAVING IT TO SETTLE AND WARM UP SINCE I LIVE SOMEWHERE FREEZING ITS PERFECT!!i always use the lavender soap for face wash and have been for the last year but i normally buy the smaller bottle from the store but i wanted to buy a bigger bottle so i took to amazon. my bottle came in and it has a weird white milky look to it which I've never seen before. i thought it was because it was cold but its been inside for a while and still looks the same. does anyone have an idea why

I bought one gallon that arrived fine. While stored in my linen closet the container cracked under the weight of the soap and leaked a gallon of soap all over the closet.  Bottle was laid on its side, and I saw no mention on the label not to rest the bottle on its side.I bought another gallon to replace the broken bottle, which was a total loss. The new bottle arrived with the cap loosened and coming off, the soap had leaked all the way through both boxes. I tried to initiate a return/replacement for the damaged product and found out there is no replacement available for this product.I love Dr Bronners soaps but this container suffers from a serious design flaw and the store's inability to work with a customer who has done nothing wrong is extremely disappointing.In short, I would not buy this product again but would stick to the smaller bottles that do not seem to suffer from the same design flaw.

I use this soap for my small business it‚Äôs fantastic! However the packaging is absolutely terrible and the product came literally leaking out of the box and the delivery driver didn‚Äôt even bother to apologize or care. This gallon is so expensive and it needs to be packed with more care since the delivery drivers are clearly mishandling the packaging. The top of this item needs to be secured way better! People are spending their hard earned money and it should not be arriving leaking out of the box at all! It‚Äôs unacceptable!!!After contacting customer service they were very helpful in giving a full refund !!

I bought this for a couple of reasons.I have eczema on my hands and needed a gentle cleaner. This still burned when washing.I wanted a non toxic soap to clean with.It seems to be non toxic but does not clean my dishes or laundry very well.On top of everything, Dr Bronners is a big supporter of planned parenthood and so at this point I‚Äôm done giving them my money.

I love Dr. Bronner‚Äôs products and usually get them from our local health food store.  However, running out before our next shopping trip, I ordered from Amazon.  BIG mistake.  It arrived yesterday so I brought it in and had it sitting on the floor of my bathroom before I topped off the smaller bottle I use.  A few hours later my partner went to brush his teeth and the entire floor was covered in this concentrated soap.  I‚Äôm unclear if the bottle was defective or if the delivery driver dropped the box but there is a good third to half the bottle that is wasted.  I put the bottle with remaining liquid, inverted with the cap tightly secured, into a clean wash bucket and it leaked the rest out into the tub.  I don‚Äôt have anything to transfer it into, unless I ‚Äòcan‚Äô it in mason jars.  And to add insult to injury, there are no returns or replacements on this product so I‚Äôm just out the funds.  Again, I love the Dr. Bronner‚Äôs company but I won‚Äôt be buying this product from Amazon EVER again.  What a scam.

Ordered unscented and received peppermint. Returned and ordered unscented and again received peppermint. This soap is great if they'd just send the right one.

This is an expensive bottle of soap. It was worth it the first time I bought it because it was very thick and concentrated and lasted a long time. It seemed like a good value. This time, the price was the same, but was very thinly watered down. A rip-off. Not the same concentrated value as before.

I bought this as an insecticidal soap and the jury is still out on that as I have only used it one time so far. But one thing that made me happy about ordering this was the versatility it offered specifically that it was for sensitive skin and even hair washing. The products I use for my hair have become hard if not impossible to find so this was surly the answer, NO! I washed my hair with a tiny amount and immediately my scalp began to itch horribly, horribly! I will not be using it at all for anything other thing than insects. DEFINITELY NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN and as a veterinary technician I do NOT recommend using this on any dog with sensitive skin either! The seller says it can be used to wash your dog but if they have a reaction they can pull their hair out and get severe hotspots requiring a visit to the vet to relieve the pain and stop the reaction.

I ordered Dr. Bronners 18-in-one unscented product to use mainly as a dish soap, but it cannot do even this job! It leaves a thin oily film on dishes! I've tried to dilute 1:10, 1:3, 1:1, use pure soap, but nothing works! When I leave my dishes to soak in water and then use the soap to wash my hands in the same sink, my dishes get this thick whitish film on them which is hard to get rid of. I also had to spend twice as much time to scrub my sink off from the soap coating -- and do it twice as frequent as when I used any other dish soap. I wanted to love this product, but I can't. It almost makes it cry when I try to wash my dishes. I am completely disappointed. It is surprising that I don't see similar reviews -- perhaps there is a magic trick to use it that I don't know about?Oh, and what is more -- it dries my skin on hands, I even get some kind of rash. I've never had a sensitive skin until I tried this product.

I really like this soap. I use it on my 2 year olds and havent noticed any break outs, where as with Aveeno and johnsons they were. The only thing i can say is a bit weird is that its kinda like if you dont use it quick enough it to wash your self with it seems like itll wash away off the cloth. I may also be doing something wrong but feels like when i give my boys a bath i gotta be quick or just disappears off the cloth.Update: yeah im not to happy with this product anymore. My hands have been very dry these past couple days and yesterday i ended up getting a few little cuts on them. Well i went to give my kids a bath got some of the soap on the cuts and my word did it burn. It burned like i had just poured bleach over them. So sorry but the soap is horrible if it burns like hell over a few little cuts.

I received the 1-gallon jar of Dr. Bronner's soap (18 in 1 hemp baby unscented pure castile soap) on Dec. 29, 2021.  Right away I noticed something unusual about it: it was milky white. I waited for one week to open it; by then the color had changed to a clear amber, the color it usually comes in. When I unscrewed the cap, I was surprised to find there was no seal on the opening; and the liquid soap, when poured, was like water, lacking in viscosity.  It seems that the gallon bottle was filled with something diluted then sold as Dr. Bronner's. I have been buying Dr. Bronner's for a number of times. But this is the first time I have a nagging feeling that what I bought is not Dr. Bronner's soap.  There is no option for a return or refund.  Caveat emptor.

So disappointed as I have used the scent free for years.  This time I got it and there was a light smell. For most people this would be ok but my spouse has multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) and this caused an attack. Will not purchase again.

This made my hair & body sticky like I just pour glue all over it!  The ONLY reason I am buying again is because I use oil on my scalp and this is the only shampoo that lasts forever.  I use it 1/3 shampoo & 2/3 water with a soap foam pump.  But I always have to use one or two lathers of normal shampoo so that my hair does not feel like I just pour glue on it.  It feels the same way on my skin using the soap bars.  How can anyone be ok with that feeling?  I used it for several months so it is not a case of getting used to it like many say.  It always feels like I just poured glue on my hair and skin if using the soap body bars and my hair and skin will stick to itself and each other!  Gross!

I purchased this item to make my own make up wipes. After reading good reviews I decided to purchase this. I was so excited to try this all natural soap. The first try was disappointing, after washing my face I felt a residue, almost a thin film, on my face and hands. I didn't want to give up on it right away so I tried it again with the same results. I ran out of hand soap so i followed the instructions on bottle for hand soap, diluted as instructed but still same results only this time I started to notice that residue on my sink faucet, same residue I would feel on my skin (leaving my skin feeling dirty) residue that wouldn't have shown up on my sink had I used my usual hand soap. Needles to say I will not buy this again nor will I use it to clean as it would leave that residue on the surface. Very dissapointed.

Please read ALL of the fine print on this bottle. Like many others, I loved using this product. I never thought to read the small print on it, which states that ‚ÄúThe real rabbi Hillel taught Jesus‚Äù The maker of this brand pushes a religion called ‚ÄúThe Moral ABC‚Äù, which is not the true gospel of Jesus Christ. As a Christian, I refuse to support this brand anymore and will be throwing all Dr. Bronner products that I have away.

My baby has eczema and I read the reviews and thought this might be a good product for my baby since it's "BABY MILD". WRONG! I poured some in my baby's bath water, put her in and she screamed like she was in a lot of pain. her skin immediately turned bright red, after drying her off, her skin looked like she had got burnt. (i never used hot water to bathe her, only lukewarm or cool, simply because her skin is very sensitive) I can tell the product was the reason for the irritation of her skin. i didnt want to waste the product so I decided to use it and I did not like it at all. it does burn your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin) you know that feeling when you have an itchy, irritated area on your skin and it comes in contact with something strong, like alcohol, matter of fact it feels like a really bad sunburn. i know this is how my daughter skin was feeling. my poor baby. oh, and the smell was not pleasant at all!

Our household doesn‚Äôt eat or use seed oils (pufa‚Äôs). This has palm kernel oil and I didn‚Äôt realize. Non refundable, so going in the trash.

Have used castle soap before not sure what this is ,absolutely not like anything Used previously

So that I thought would help me with my allergies and it was not the Product needed.  whatever chemicals are in the product I‚Äôm allergic to.

I wouldn't buy again, save your money- After receiving the item the seal had been tampered with and it let out a strange odor, the consistency of the soap was that of water and it leaves your skin completely dry, would not recommend

I went to use the product today for the first time since I ordered and the product came open and was spilling! You can see the dry soap around the bottle.

Well bought this like thinking oh this is nice. But the bottle has a strange creepy and weird writing on it. So it got send right back to its creepy company. Also it came with the cape broken.

I heard good things about this soap and how it has less harmful ingredients but if has been the worst soap for my hair. It left my hair sticky and yes I diluted it. It‚Äôs so hard to pass my fingers through my hair. My husband wash his hair with it too and it did the same thing to his hair. I would not recommend for hair. I just use it for my body but it doesn‚Äôt feel as great in the body neither. I‚Äôm just not going  to  buy it anymore.

I don't have any allergies whatsoever but this caused really terrible skin lesions and itching all over the body.Not just me. Everyone in my household who used got those terrible skin rashes and itching.The worst thing, since it is marketed so well, with so many good reviews, I have not suspected it at all.It took me a few months to figure out that this is not really "pure" and for "baby skin" or "organic".I would not even recommend this torture to my enemies.Who ever works at Bonner's, must be a vile, if not really sadistic, person.Never buying from this brand again.

like other customers have said, it is very diluted. I was disappointed and made a mental note not to buy again, but thought I'd go ahead and use this giant bottle. It's now 2 months into the bottle and the soap has began to smell like a cooked turkey carcass (funny I know, but if you know what that smells like - it is GROSS). I'm not sure what is going on with this but maybe if it is actually diluted like many ppl suspect, it could be growing bacteria due to the pH being off from what it should be? Who knows. Will never purchase again and sorry I did this time.

Item arrived almost empty because bottle was broken.

This soap smells exactly like a stink bug..not simaler but exactly...of u can get past that it's fine..I can't.

I love this product but was very disappointed that it had leaked all over the inside of the box and about 1/4 of it was empty. Can I get a replacement?  Thank you!

Bought this thinking that it would be safe & gentle enough for my sensitive face. I‚Äôve been giving myself hives every time I‚Äôve washed my face with this soap. Turns out it‚Äôs the oils used in these products that contain Vitamin E and then they added extra Vitamin E to it. I‚Äôm sure this soap works great for most people but for me I kept giving myself hives for weeks. My face looked terrible and am still recovering from its effects. So please be aware that if this soap burns/stings or your face becomes red with small bumps you may be allergic to the Vitamin E in it.

This soap is not to used on the skin or private areas.  It burns the private areas.  I could not find out why I itched to much, scratching was horrible, especially the my neck.  Come to find out it was this soap, left me with a rash.  I threw away both bottles!  For those of you that love it, hey I use it.

love this product but received tampered and watered down product from a seller called FSN (perhaps that's the new name for "Timely Goods" the other tamperer mentioned in these reviews)  The batch I received was leaking on arrival and all three seals were detached.  Not only watered down, but toxic product -- I had an immediate allergic reaction just from smelling it and I have a raging headache, which I've never had in 20 years of using Dr. Bronners liquid soap.  Also, when I shake it, it immediately forms bubbles. Try shaking undiluted dr Bronners from another bottle - it only forms a few small bubbles at the top. Finally, it is a much lighter color than the other bottles I've purchased.

Bought this soap due to the great reviews.  I really don't get what the hype is about.  I have dry skin skin and this soap does me no favors.  I gave it a try for a week.  It seems to strip my skin making it even drier.  If you are looking for unscented soap, this works in that area but definitely not a fan.  Waste of money because I won't be using it anymore.

Steer clear if you don't want hemp in yours or your childs system. If you have to take a urinalysis, this could get you fired. They DID NOT indicate that hemp was in the baby formula.

Love this product but buy it at a local store. I received it in my mailbox and the bottle opened up while it was being shipped. It was completely empty and soap was everywhere. When I tried to return it, I found out that it wasn‚Äôt eligible for a return. Don‚Äôt waste your money buying it on amazon

The last two containers of this soap we received have been very watery!  Our first few were great!  It‚Äôs like they are selling water now and the product does even come close to cleaning like it did previously.

When I received this, I smelled it right away and couldn't smell anything.I used it for mixing with oils for holiday scented foam soap.No matter how much oil I added, I would still walk away with an ugly smell on my handsafter washing.  Totally defeated my purpose!

I buy this particular castle soap all the time and this product was nothing like ive ever seen. It had the texture of water! This tinnnnny little bottle of water with a dash of soap was not worth 10 bucks !

When I opened the box, there was soap all over the outside of the container and in the box.  Upon closer inspection, the flip top was chipped and when I removed the screw off cap, the covering was punctured.  No way will I use this product that has obviously been tampered with.  This is so disappointing.  It costs too much for shipping to send this back, so it's not worth it.  I am simply out the money.  I didn't think this purchase was any big deal and did not for a second think there would be any issues, but I was definitely wrong on that.

Bronners is excellent, but despite the size, this packaging is definitely not intended for traveling--- these bottles leak an incredible amount; I probably lost more than 3/4 of the contents over the course of a week, and the remaining bit went all over my clothes when I (stupidly) thought I'd try and keep it in a plastic bag. Wonderful soap, but this is terrible, very poorly thought out packaging; you'd be better off buying the large bottle and using the savings for a buying an intended travel bottle

What kind of pathetic attempt at proselytizing is this?  Who thinks having bible verses on a label is clever, funny, or cool? Squares, obviously.The soap might be good, but the bronze-age nonsense was absolutely a deal breaker for me.  I cannot support this product or company.  Shame on me for not doing the research up front, I suppose.

It was runny . Not what I expected

We used this one time tonight on my 1 year old. It came out like liquid.. he ended up getting it in his eyes. He screamed for hours. He‚Äôs had soap in his eyes before but he screamed as if he has bleach in his eyes. When I bought this I was under the impression it was marketed towards babies/toddlers but I will be discontinuing use.

I really wanted to like this but it does have a smell to it; like an industrial cleaner smell.  And the smell lasts on my hands as well as my face.  It reminds me of a cleaner my Dad used to use to clean the school with when he was a custodian!  I have tried to cover up the smell with an essential oil but I can still smell it.  Perhaps I got an old supply; IDK but I'm not happy with it.  And also, what is up with all the religious writing on the bottle!?  It took me awhile to actually read about the product itself.

When arrived, bottle was leaking and seal was broken. What was odd was that there was yellow masking tape wrapped all around the lid. If you buy this at a regular store, you know that there is no way that the seal inside can break. The round Styrofoam was completely detached and was floating between the lid and mouth of the bottle.I don't believe that this was a brand new product. Either it was watered down by the seller (it was really watery), or they sent me an item returned by somebody else. I feel very disappointed and for sure will purchase from a different seller in the future.

Supposed to be for babies but it isn‚Äôt gentle! My granddaughter got a small amt in her eyes and she was so very uncomfortable! Her eyes were so red for a long time even after rinsing with fresh water.

Hiker here.  I put a small amount in a capped bottle for a 100 mile hike.  After making camp by a large lake, I put the small bottle in my pocket to carry down to the lake.  The bottle leaked and I did not realize it until later.  Where it leaked on my leg, it caused first and second degree chemical burns (bubbling of the skin => desquamation).  This is powerful stuff.  Dilute well before use. Rinse immediately.  Read the caustic ingredients in it. "Baby" in the title denotes safety but my experience is different.

I ordered non-scented. To test it out I have very sensitive skin and I don‚Äôt even like lavender and I can definitely smell the essential oils in it and feel it on my skin. Rinse off very well.

FIRST: I have been buying this same exact gallon for yearssssss. Just opened this new gallon today, the color is way off. Its also wY more diluted than it should be. A little usually goes a long way but I had to double the amount I used to get the same lather. This is watery compared to the original. What's the deal here?

DO NOT BUY.  Sold by Quivrr.  I bought 2 gallons.  One arrived in a ziploc bag with a broken seal.  Both appear to be significantly diluted.  I have purchased this product many times directly from Dr. Bronner's website.  I compared these 2 gallons to my remaining gallon from an older order.  The "soap" in this order is much lighter in color than previous orders from the manufacturer.  They're going back, and I will go back to ordering directly from Dr. Bronner's.

This product looks like it was tampered with and diluted! It was really thin in consistency and has a lot of bubbles which usually only happens when you dilute it with water! The people selling them are probably doubling the amount of money they make by diluting this product and that just not right...and on top of it, the cap was broken and the soap was everywhere when I took it out of the box. So disappointed!

Used for over a week twice a day and I saw no difference

The bottle says unscented but there is a smell! I have stage 4 breast cancer and the smell from this soap makes meVomit every time! Horrible!!!!

States it's unscented  - it's not.  Strong scent when you wash with it.  Bottle is COVERED in odd biblical scripture.  Things about "spaceship earth, dinosaurs,  jelly fish, etc. " just off the wall things. My daughter is too creeped out to use it now after reading all those things all over the bottle.

Ok if you're the loofah type.. I guess? But this is small... buy a bigger one if you're the loofah type.

Let me start by stating that I am a soap maker myself. I make handmade soaps and shampoo bars. I wanted to try a liquid baby shampoo that was non toxic for my 2 year old. I stumbled upon this stuff. Issue #1 this is labeled as a "castile" soap- a true castile soap is made with all or mostly olive oil!!! The first ingredient is coconut oil with olive oil coming in as 5th ingredient on the label, meaning they probably used a very minimal amount of it and nothing that would make this stuff "moisturizing"! Coconut oil is not moisturizing. It is very cleansing and tends to strip all oils (which leads people to think its drying, however it isn't). With all that being said, this stuff will be good for cleaning dishes and around the house ONLY. This stuff is far too harsh for your skin and hair, especially for a young toddler!! I used it 2x on my face and it ended up chapping my face (kind of like a windburn) I have shampooed my hair with this and my hair is extremely stripped and dry now and it didn't work on my toddlers hair either. I wont be using this on our hair anymore. I will finish the rest on the dishes and maybe my laundry. I will just make my own liquid shampoo instead of purchasing any more even though I was trying to avoid the whole process of doing that.

has potassium hydroxide (they say None remains after saponifying oils into soap & glycerin). Yet it is an inorganic caustic chemical.Potassium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula KOH, and is commonly called caustic potash.Along with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), KOH is a prototypical strong base. It has many industrial and niche applications, most of which utilize its caustic nature and its reactivity toward acids. An estimated 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes were produced in 2005. KOH is noteworthy as the precursor to most soft and liquid soaps, as well as numerous potassium-containing chemicals. It is a white solid that is dangerously corrosive.[11

The seal was broken and leaking, the soap is all dried up on the outside so it has been opened for quite a long time, which leads me to believe it wasn‚Äôt damaged in shipping but was open before it was sent out.

I love this soap! It's unscented and works great at stains and is gentle on the skin.However, the returns process is terrible. No one wants to help you if you get a busted gallon of soap in the mail. Wish this could have been easier. I now have spent $71 on an item I can't get a refund or replacement for.

Learned this 16oz bottle is a lot cheaper on other places. You can buy twice the size for the same price.

It's a good product but the seller is overpricing it. Found it for 15$ in the local grocery store instead of 26$ here...

This product is small, only 8 FL OZ/237 ml and is $10.  I bought from target twice the size(16FL OZ) of this for the same price. The bigger one on the image is from target and is finished. I am going to return the smaller one.

I love how the product is all natural and you can use it for everything but I am very disappointed of how runny the soap is ! it‚Äôs literally water, and when I try to use a little a whole bunch spills out because of how watery it is! I don‚Äôt know if they added water or this is how the soap is !. I don think I will buy again I will look for something better.

When I first bought this item (07/2019), I read through the comments. Even if some comments claimed that the gallon appeared to be diluted, I bought it anyways. I was upset when the package arrived and the seal was broken. Liquid all over...lucky the other items in the box just needed a rinse and nothing in the box was electronics! I used majority of the gallon as needed. Now time does a refill!! I decided to back to the smaller bottles. When they came in I was amazed ‚Äúhow diluted‚Äù the gallon is actually is!!! I took a picture of the small amount I have left (I transferred the gallon to a smaller container to make more rome in my cabinet). Picture on the left is the original castle soap. Picture on the right is the small amount from the gallon. I will see is there is a difference. But buyers are now aware that there is a visual difference!

We only use castile soap in our house for all cleaning purposes.  We have been using Dr. Woods for years with ZERO complaints.  We bought Dr. Woods b/c it is cheaper.  However, when I saw Dr. Bronners at the Thrive Market for almost as good of a price as Dr. Woods, I ordered five bottles of Dr. Bronner's thinking that it is made with organic oils and therefore may possibly be of a better quality.  Never will i make this mistake again:  Dr. Bronner's constantly dries and builds up a clog in the soap pump opening, and when you go to get a squirt of soap into your hand -- it squirts out of control into my eyes, onto my clothing, onto the walls.  it is super annoying and unpleasant.  We have been hating this thing.  I will NEVER buy it again.  Today, my husband was rushing out to work, he went to wash his hands and his clean shirt got a splash of soap on the front!  He had to throw a perfectly clean shirt into the laundry and get another one.  This is extremely irritating and a disappointment.

Disappointed. After reading all the positive reviews online I decided to try this for my 2 year old. I have been using another brand since his birth and liked it, but it did make his skin a bit dry, so after my last bottle of shampoo ran out I thought I try something different . The soap did not cause any skin reaction( and my son has a very sensitive skin) , however it leave the skin very sticky, even my hands after washing my kid are extremely sticky . the soap is very runny, and while it does not generate any foam at all after mixing with water, it make water in the tub look ‚Äúfoggy‚Äù, which is odd.The most important thing is the advertised use of this ‚Äúsoap‚Äù. The label has so much writing on it that I did not look at anything, but ingredients, and thought they look ok. My husband however studied the label, and while I can ignore and put aside irrelevant religious propaganda printed on this label, the fact that it‚Äôs advertises product that supposed to be a ‚Äúbaby soap‚Äù as a laundry detergent, floor and dish cleaner in addition to baby soap I found strange at minimum and it certainly made me not want to use it on my kid.

I had such high hopes for this soap.  We were using California Baby soap but, they changed their ingredients and we decided to jump ship and try this.  By this time, my son was already two years old (we'd faithfully used California Baby up until that point) and he was use to soap getting near his eyes and it being "okay".  Dr. Bronners has made bath time unbearable.  After a few times of accidentally getting into his eyes - he's now SO fearful of bath time.  We can coach him into the tub but, as soon as he sees the soap he breaks down, screams and begs us to "put it back!"=/  I used some on my face and it BURNS your eyes like crazy!!  I would be scared too if I were him.I really don't know where to go from here.  Maybe soap free?  I don't want to go back to California Baby because of their standards and practices.  I think Dr. Bronner's is a fine brand - just find it hard to understand why they wouldn't try to make their baby soap tear free.  Maybe they can't?  Anyway - this is not a good soap for babies/toddlers that might be squirmy and might end up with soap in the eyes. But, over all, it leaves your skin soft, clean and coming from someone like myself whom is fragrance/chemical sensitive - it's IS unscented. A good buy for adults, but in my opinion, miss marketed as a "baby" soap.

We've been happy with this product for some years but for the price they should really address packaging. This delivery leaked a fair amount out of the cap and down the side. Would recommend the product just not a fan of the packaging.

I ordered Dr. Bronner's 18 in 1 hemp baby unscented pure Castille soap.  From all I have read it appears to be an excellent product. My issue is that I cannot read the instructions on the bottle, as the print is extremely tiny, along with a light blue tint against a white background, and an even smaller white print on a light blue background. Even with my magnifying glass I could not make it all out. Furthermore, a shipping label on the back obscured some of the instructions - tried peeling it off, but to no avail. I cannot use the product until I can read the instructions. Sorry, but that's how it is offered. I could not find any readable instructions on the website unless I missed it.

I have received this product on 31 Aug 2021 and have it unbox on 1 Sept 2021.  When I cut the plastic packing, it has some juicy stuff inside the plastic.  I guessed it has leaked.  I noticed that the seal cover has been unsealed already and the plastic cap are not screwed tightly.  It happened in both bottles.I have ordered this 8 oz product previously the seal cover was very tight and difficult to remove.  That's why I wonder if this is the genuine or defective product.

The soap seems to be what it is advertised However I have concerns that what we received is actually what should be in the bottle (seems to be a little thin in consistency) when it was received there was a piece of tape across the top of the bottle cap and when I removed the tape the cap was very loose.When I removed the cap the seal that should have been in place and need to be torn off was completely removed and fell to the floor. This indicates to me that the safety seal was removed possibly to refill the bottle - I will not be purchasing from this seller again

Purchased this to help with my Seborrheic Dermatitis, but it made it worse. My scalp was constantly flaking all over the place and I'd have people ask me what was on my shirt or in my hair. I give it two stars because I do have incredibly sesnitive skin and I didn't have an allergic reaction to it, just the part of my scalp that has the condition. It wasn't moisturizing at all.

I ordered the peppermint one first, but it let my hands dry, scaly and itchy.  So I figured the baby soap would be better. Nope, it had the same effect.  Seemed like a very harsh, drying soap. That being said, I am sensitive to soaps.  I can not use this one.  The peppermint soap worked great in the clothes washing machine though.

I got the product for my newborn but I wanted to try it on my skin before I use it on my baby and it made me itchy. I added water to it.  It ha no scent which is ok I guess it didn‚Äôt sud up good when put on a towel

Tried diluting this to use as a dish soap but I haven't been pleased with how it's worked so far. It doesn't seem to cut grease very well. I tried making it more concentrated but that just left a weird residue on the dishes. Also the diluted soap winds up the consistency of water, and since we hand wash all of our dishes we went through an entire bottle in one day because it comes out so fast, and you have to re-soap the sponge for almost every dish because it rinses so quickly. I wanted this to work because I like the idea of putting environmentally friendly things down the drain, but I think we have hard water in our area and it doesn't work will with this soap, not to mention is prohibitively expensive at the rate we go through it.

If you were like me and heard alot about Dr.Bronners soap and figured you‚Äôll give it a try with the baby soap because you have sensitive skin and you assume that the baby soap wont break you out. IT WILL. Well speaking for myself my face immediately began burning and breaking out and the solution I created was DILUTED. Truly a horrible experience. I Will give 2 stars instead of one incase my situation is unique however if you read the beginning of this and feel like that description it you.. I would stop while your ahead...I wouldn‚Äôt put this on my dog..

It was smaller than I thought it would be.

There is a strong smell with this product, and it made my head itch and irritated my breathing.  For being "pure" no-one mentioned the smell.  It is still very chemical, and we are allergic to essential oils so we couldn't add them to mitigate the smell.  The instructions were not very thorough and we should have diluted it much more than it said.

My skin has never been so dry in my life. I dont know what to day, like it cleans so well it dries out the skin? I dont know

I thought I was buying soap, not a weird rambling scripture tome... The outside of the bottle reads like the deranged writings of a homeless schizophrenic - "one God" this and "unite mankind" that and the "moral ABCs" of what-have-you. The WHOLE LABEL is covered from top-to-bottom and edge-to-edge in fine print preachings on how to save the human race or whatever. I returned the product unused, not interested in having my money go to some weird cult.

There is something in this that is very irritating to my skin. I bought this when money was tight. It was less than my usual, all natural brand, but definitely not worth the breakout it caused. I use castile soap to make my own body wash, shampoo, and dog shampoo. I didn't use it on the dogs in fear that they would be as miserable as I was.

I‚Äôve always used Dr. Bonners soap for anything that involves my twins. Once the package arrived I opened it and see that the top lip is opened! In the times we‚Äôre living  in it‚Äôs hard to trust things especially things that involves my babies.

The product I received was very different than the product pictured.  It was in a white gallon jug and the soap was very milky looking and super sudsy (which I've never seen before).  I don't know what this is, but it's not Castille soap and I'm not using it!  YIKES!  I wish I could include a photo with this review....UPDATE:  the soap did clear up after about 24 hrs in the house.  Maybe it just turns milky when cold?  I'll give it a try.

if anyone is using this for your private area be cautious, if you don‚Äôt have sensitive skin in will probably be ok but it caused pretty bad irritation down there for me.

Contents were as advertised and the price per ounce makes this a better buy.  The top of the bottle cap was torn off and not in the shipping container; sent visibly and obviously damaged with no way to close once the inner seal is removed.  There is no mechanism to ask the seller to send me a cap.

I like this soap for all its crunchy attributes but won't be buying it again because I am sick of the mess it makes of my bathroom.  The label forewarns that it has a tendency to clog soap dispensers and this has certainly been the case for me.  It will often completely clog the dispenser making it unusable and necessitating a day- or two-day long soak to unclog it.  It also will form a small clog at the tip of the dispenser that is pushed out with normal use but causes the soap to spray all over the bathroom wall near the sink.  My bathroom walls are covered in Dr. Bronner's soap.  I'm sick of this high maintenance soap and sadly bid it adieu.

Cost per volume is a little high

I‚Äôve been buying this product for years, it‚Äôs hard to find, was glad to find it for a decent price on Amazon. Other reviews mention poor shipping and I have to agree with them, it‚Äôs awful, I‚Äôve attached photos.

While partially my fault, I am very allergic to hemp but had heard great things about this soap, and googling told me that Castile soap was olive-oil based, and when I received it, it clearly says hemp and hemp oil on the bottle. I ended up giving it to a friend who doesn't have any allergies to the ingredients, but the weird religious text all over the bottle is also... odd to say the least.

This doesn't get soapy AT ALL. It pretty much just drips right off the bottle brush before you even get to scrub the bottle or any kids dishes. Very thin solution. Both me and my husband disliked it. We ended up mixing it with a thicker soap, and since then just continued ordering the OTHER dish soap.

I don't like the way it dispenses at all. In the past I used Natural Way Organics Ultra Mild Unscented Castile Soap, and it dispenses (mind I'm using the exact same dispenser) in a white foam, and the liquid soap lasts way longer.With Dr. Bronner's it comes out of the dispenser as a thicker sort of light yellowish paste, and it really uses much more of the liquid soap.My mistake, I thought it would be the same and purchased 2 bottles, live and learn....

I've read review after review that says this stuff is amazing for drealocks, so I bought a giant bottle of it. I am diluting it with 20% soap, 80% water to use for shampoo. Well with how hard our water is here in Phoenix, it's made my hair incredibly waxy. It doesn't wash out! I have read 5% soap and 95% water is what you need to shoot for. And it's been suggested to add vinegar to the mix to compensate for the hard water, but I don't want my hair smelling like vinegar.I'll probably use the rest of it for hand soap but it took a few shampoos of regular shampoo to get this junk out of my hair.

I really don't understand the hype. I know bronners does a good job "selling" the fact that it's soap and not detergent but what does it matter in the end. This soap is super alkaline which is pretty harsh on skin. My skin begs for moisturizer right after. I wouldn't put this on my baby. I'm currently trying to use it up in other ways.

I've never used Dr. Bronner's Liquid Soap before, so I never knew what the consistency should be when I opened my bottle. It turned out that it shouldn't be runny like water, but thick. Maybe the soap now comes pre-watered down? The product itself works well. I used it to kill ants, but have found it works well as a dish soap and cleaner. Will continue to use, but disappointed to find out it's not the correct dilution. I'm not sure if the fault lies with the manufacturer or the company I purchased it from, but I purchased it from Hi-Tech Products (not sure why I'm buying soap from somewhere called "Hi-Tech")

I used less than what the directions say for mixing in water for counter spray. And I only spray a few times, but when I wipe there is a soapy streak that trails my sponge. I don't have this problem with other products I've tried like Mrs Meyers. Guess I will use this as a hand soap.

Let the buyer buyer beware. I did not read the fine print carefully, and thought I'd be getting a couple of 32 ounce bottles of Dr Bronner's soap at a reasonable price.  What I got was a couple of 16 ounce bottles at an exorbitant price.  The soap is good; the price is not.  It's my own *#$% fault.

This product makes your skin very dry after use. It also wasn't what i expected. It becomes solid when below a certain temperature. Not good for my hand soap business. I like that it was unscented. But its not for me.

Bought this to use in hospital after open heart surgery while in recovery. Hospital disapproved because of HEMP OIL and anesthesiologist conflict. While in plain sight on the label it did not occur to me it could be a problem . It's hard to find unscented glycerin free soap.

Very irritating on adult sensitive skin. Smells like floor cleaner to.

It is not for sensitive skin or scalp. It dried out my hair until it looked like straw.

I bought this in hopes as often as I wash dishes that it would be a more gentle soap on my hands.  It is! Very soft and doesn't dry my fingers out or leave them cracking. BUT.... it doesn't clean. It leaves dishes greasy feeling no matter how many pumps I use or how much I rinse them.

As much as I wanted this product to work for me it didn't. My hair would be left with a waxy residue which would eventually accumulate on my hairbrush. My hair also became harder to brush as a result. However, if you are a first time buyer I would not let this comment discourage you from getting this product as all hair types are different. What didn't work for me could very well work for others.

Gentle & love the baby scent

I have eczema and sensitive skin. I had a bad flare on my hands. I thought this would help, but  I found that it was drying out my hands.

This stung my 1 year olds eyes pretty badly. Maybe I misunderstood the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù label on the front but be careful to avoid any getting in your eyes.

it helped psoriasis however made my face and lady bits sting and burn...

The product is as advertised. The problem is the Cap/flip lid was delivered smashed. I hope in the future this issue will be resolved.

It seems to me that this bottle/brand is missing something. When I buy this brand elsewhere it seems to be of better quality.

Burns when using on V spot. Did not received an 8 Oz bottle as indicated below

Good stuff but... expensive for the size of the bottle you get.

I bought this (unscented mini) to travel with for a weekend while healing a new tattoo. My artist uses it on my fresh tattoo and I wanted something I could throw in my bag to soap up with once or twice throughout the day no matter where I am, and this fit the bill for that purpose.I can‚Äôt use Dr. Bronners or other traditional ‚Äúsoaps‚Äù regularly in the shower though, because I find them way too stripping/drying for my skin (even when diluted properly). Soaps usually have a high ph which may be the cause. I normally use a ‚Äúbeauty bar‚Äù which uses more mild surfectants as opposed to real ‚Äúsoap,‚Äù and has a lower ph which works better for me. So if your skin is prone to dryness like mine, you‚Äôll probably find this way too drying for regular use, too.Good in a pinch like for my tattoo wash or when you need to really feel that everything-stripped-off, ‚Äúsqueaky clean‚Äù sensation but too drying for every day.

I bought this for my 2.5 year old son, who has issues with other, store bought soaps (very rough and scaley patches of skin, similar to eczema?).I bought the unscented one due to me having issues with some essential oils, including lavender, and coconut oil.There is a smell that sticks to the person washed. It's not a pleasant smell. It wears off after a couple days, but I think I need to find an essential oil that I'm not allergic to, that will smell better.I used this in a pinch to wash my hands. I literally used a tiny drop (undiluted except from when I wet my hands) and it lathered enough that it felt like soap. I had touched a stinky used sponge, and that smell sticks to me. Dawn doesn't get rid of that smell. This stuff did, and I could tell that the unpleasant smell of this castile soap wasn't just covering the even worse old sponge smell. Then I washed my hands with Dawn, and the smell of the castile soap was lightened.I did make a hand soap recipe (given on the bottle). The unpleasant smell sticks with the dilution of this recipe as well.All in all, I'm not sure if I'll purchase this again.I will use it for my 2.5 year old for all his baths and won't use another kind of soap on his body, to see if it takes care of his skin patches. So far, the patches seem to be smaller, and not red at all, like they have sometimes been. So I'm slightly hopeful for this soap for him.

The one on the left was ordered November 2022 the one on the right we just received today March 18.The one on the left was received full above the handle. The one on the right is far below the handle and discolored.Will be sending this product back for a full refundI gave this product three stars because the one on the left that I‚Äôve been using cleans very well and works great. If it weren‚Äôt for that, I would give it zero for what we received today.

For this price i could have gone to utla or local stores and got the biggest bottle for $10 definitely not worth the price but i needed it for my daughter

This review is really probably only useful for people specifically looking for a CPAP cleaning soap... Bottom line, look elsewhere. I can't comment on any other use for the soap, and I must point out that this soap does not claim to be sold for cleaning CPAP supplies. However fo those looking for a soap for cleaning CPAP supplies, here are my comments:I read a recommendation to use this as a soap for cleaning CPAP supplies. It is "okay". I like that it does not foam as much as other soaps I've used. I have sensitive skin and had absolutely no reactions to it, so great there. I also like the natural, biodegradable ingredients in it, with no extra chemicals added, etc. However, I find it leaves a scent behind that I do not like for my CPAP (not strong, but annoying -- I want to breath air at night not perfumes/scents). It also makes the water surprisingly cloudy, which both concerns me and makes it harder to find small pieces at the bottom of my wash tank. It does not seem to leave any residue, but it did appear to make the plastic of my heated tube cloudy -- I don't understand why it would do this, but also concerns me. I will be looking for another soap.

Way too expensive

This felt like it dried out my scalp and hair more than anything else that I have used.  This just does not help my dry scalp.

I had high hopes for this cleanser but it didn't clean the cream foundation off my makeup brush.  Cleans normal powder makeup fine, so will keep for that.  But won't buy again.

The product is excellent BUT I did order non-scented offering BUT received the lavender scented option!

It‚Äôs a great product, but came with a broken lid and covered in soap! Also lost a good amount of the product. Disappointing that they don‚Äôt allow returns.

Too expensive.  Brand inflation.

It is watery compared to other similar products.It is impossible to read the label... probably intentional.I may go back to the generic product.

Bought on here because Target was out of stock and needed some, however the price gauge on here is crazy ‚Ä¶. This is an 8oz bottle that cost me 11 bucks, I target sells the 16 Oz bottle at same price and 32oz for 15 ‚Ä¶

Liked the product but not the smell!üòÅ

This was recommended for cleaning my tent. I got the unscented but it sure does smell for something unscented.

The product is good quality and is excellent for  anyone with psoriasis or sensitive skin. The only issue is that it is more expensive to putchase here then in a geocery store. I happened to check my local grocery store (Acme) and the 32oz bottle is only 18.99 which is 3x more than what the 8oz we get for 9.99. Please shop around before you purchase. I only gave ot 3 stars because of the price.

I bought one from the store, seemed like it was way better than this one. This prompted me to believe this product is not authentic or has been tempered with

Amazon is a little quick on the trigger. While I have applied this product as directed there has not been enough time to tell if it will ne effective. Ordering, receiving and applying the product was quick and easy. I will rate when I know if it works.

It‚Äôs ok, not my favorite

I ordered this soap because it was highly recommended for cleaning CPAP tubing. However I figured that review had to be wrong, after I saw that it made a very cloudy suspension, rather than a clear solution when I mixed it with warm water! There is no way that I would want a lot of insoluble essential oils forming a layer on the inside of my CPAP tubing! Essential oils may be OK for topical use on skin, and on other surfaces that I could wash and clean with ease, but not on surfaces that I depend on to help my respiration while I sleep. Unless I can find other information about this, I will have to use this soap for something else!

best one they have, please dilute this with water if you‚Äôre going to put it on your face, it‚Äôs very harsh and can destroy your skin barrier which protects your skin

This is definitely not worth the money. I bought it as an alternative to baby shampoo but you cannot get in their eyes which is nearly impossible because babies like to splash. Also the bottle is the size Of my hand. There is no scent which is understandable  since it‚Äôs for sensitive skin but it doesn‚Äôt leave a ‚Äúclean feeling‚Äù because of it and it‚Äôs so expensive! Not worth it

the size of the item was much smaller then i thought wasn‚Äôt that great of a buy for the price

smaller than i expected üôÅ

I've used Dr. Bronner's soap in the past and recently decided to purchase some more. A little goes a long way since you need to dilute this. I do feel like it cleans well but I had a couple of issues. First, my hands stayed dry from using this and the back of my left hand broke out in a rash. After a few weeks of treating the rash and it not going away, something told me to stop using the soap to see if that made any difference. Sure enough, once I stopped using it the rash started clearing up. I'm not sure why I had a bad reaction this time. The second issue was it always seemed to leave a filmy buildup in my bathtub. I could easily scrub it away but no other soap I use does this. I will use the remainder of the bottle for cleaning around the house but I won't use it on my skin anymore.

I believe this is probably a great product. The lid was broke when I received mine and it was in a plastic bag, it was to much of a hassle to return and I was to afraid to use it because whoever broke the lid took the time to put it in a bag, but not the trash, so not something I would use in my home.

I got two bottles of this soap because of all the good reviews it had on Amazon. But I'm afraid I was disappointed. I opened the first bottle and to my surprise, I found the liquid VERY thin. I thought Ok may be it's just this bottle. So I opened the 2nd bottle and found it just as watery. The texture is super thin, like very diluted liquid of some sort. To make it work, I emptied more than half of each bottle in a big dispenser even though the instructions says mix 1:10. Still , I had a hard time to use it in the shower. I won't be ordering this product again. Too bad I cannot return them since the return window has already closed. Money wasted.

Product is great and works well as a cleaner. I ordered the unscented version and got lavender instead. Thankfully scents don‚Äôt affect me too much and I don‚Äôt mind lavender. The scent is pretty heavy.

I bought this baby soap for after having surgery to my wash my body and hair for a few weeks because I could not use normal products and was recommended. I will say it did not burn my incision areas which was great, but the feel of my skin was icky and my hair was so bad after two washes that I thought I would have to cut it off. I was not expecting it to be awesome as a shampoo, but I also didn‚Äôt expect how damaging it was. Anyway, I just needed something while I healed, but I don‚Äôt think I could ever use this product for a baby after my experience.

Bought this upon another hiker's recommendation for a backpacking trip because hygiene products need to be fragrance free so as not to attract wildlife at night. It works fine as a body wash, smells all right, but it did not fully clean my hair. It left a film or something on my hair that was greasy. If you're planning on just using it on your body then it will work for you, but it will not work if you want avshampoo/soap combo product.

This is a really high price for such a small bottle. I wish I had realized that before I ordered.

I have been trying to move towards more natural products, including liquid soaps.  I definitely don't think this Dr. Bronner's soap is good for ALL purposes, as it claims.  I've purchased it from multiple sources and tested it, just in case there was any product tampering.  This has taken some trial and error, but so far, I found it is great for dish soap and in body washes (so I'm sure it's good as a general cleaner).  Even super diluted, I found that it's HORRIBLE for my hair (makes it super tacky and dry) and actually burns my sensitive face skin.  I don't think I'd ever consider using it on a baby!  But to each their own...I know different products work for different people.

Pricey  for a small little bottle

I didn't know a lot about this brand before purchasing but knew it was popular. I was surprised to see that all the small lettering on the bottle label is about religion and rules to live by such as "The ABC's of Mama Cat".As for the formula/soap- it hardly has any scent which I prefer. We use it as body soap for our 3 year old. It has not irritated his eczema. A little bit goes a long way. I wouldn't say it is moisturizing but it certainly doesn't strip the skin of moisturizer like many soaps do. It is definitely a gentle soap.

No question this is an AWESOME soap!  Love it for all the reasons everyone else has shared -- mostly the fact that it isn't perfumed.  HOWEVER, it has clogged every soap dispenser I've put it in.  Then, with the hardened, clogged soap, when you push down on the pump, the soap squirts randomly anywhere!  Like the floor (look out for slips!), the ceiling (good luck getting it off), or across the room onto the ceramic stovetop.  [Ask me how I know all this. <g>]  If anyone has a solution, I'd love to hear it because we love the soap itself!  I gave it 3 stars cuz the soap gets 5, but the clogging gets zero!

Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castile Soap can be used in so many different ways, including being gentle enough to use as toothpaste.  It's great for sensitive skin - both for humans and pets.  You never get any irritation from it either.  I just love it!For some reason I thought I was getting a good deal price-wise when I purchased from this seller but when I received the package, I found that I purchased a size smaller than expected.  The price I paid for the smaller size was the price of the bigger size.  It's cheaper to go to your local health food store.

It's ok. I'm allergic to everything and sensitive to smells and chemicals, so breathing wise these foot the bill. My hands still turn red and blotchy tho doesn't agree with some ingredient in it. Makes hands extremely dry to have to wear lotion after and I don't like a product that forces me to have to use another product to compensate. I tried the "sugar" version of this at my moms and liked it better. Less dry feeling hands after than this one. Won't be ordering again but I'll use it for now because I'm too tired to do anything about it.

I purchased this after trying the same version but with Lavender.  I felt the Lavender Dr. Bronner's made a huge improvement on my baby's eczema, so I was eager to try this big version.  I would say the soap is good, but it really burns when you get it in your eyes (obviously, we don't try to put it in our eyes, but with babies/kids, it happens).  I felt so bad when my girl's reacted to it, my husband tested it to see how bad it was, and it was bad :(  So while we like the soaps effects, it is just not worth the pain.

I have been using this product to clean baby bottle everyday. I am not sure if this product is diluted somehow but I have to use 1 gallon a month to get the job done... is this too much? Also, I use a dedicated sink for baby bottle only (dr bonner‚Äôs only of course) and noted something like white frost formed in the sink. It must be something in the product which makes me uncomfortable ... does anyone know what it is (See attached picture)?

Not worth the$$$

I bought this because I wanted to make my own shampoo. It's pricey so I had to consider if I was going to save any money by making my own. It makes a luxurious lather. It wasn't for my hair at all. I am now using baking soda as a cleanser and diluted vinegar as a rinse and it is wonderful. Now I'm saving money.Back to the castile, I won't buy it again because it is expensive. I made a 3 lb. loaf of castile soap with organic oils, grated it melted it watered it down.I made my own liquid castile. It's something productive I can do with my time, really premium products for our home while saving money. Love that!Back to the castile soap. It's a five star product. One of the best liquid all purpose soaps on the market. It's the price that lowers my rating.

I bought this because the hospital I delivered my daughter at, suggested washing her bottles a pump parts with Castile soap. (I had previously just washed with dish soap for my sons bottles, but thought I'd give it a try) This was a good value and lasted a while. Is thinner/runnier than traditional soap. My biggest complaint is that it seemed to leave a oily residue. I may not have been diluting it correctly, but I did follow the directions on the bottle. In the end I switched back to regular dish soap.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êI recently tried Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Unscented variant, and while I found the product to be of high quality with its organic ingredients and versatile uses, I'm providing a four-star review due to the relatively high price point. Here's a breakdown of my experience:1. **High-Quality Ingredients:** Dr. Bronner's commitment to using organic oils is evident in the product's quality. The soap is gentle, suitable for sensitive skin, and versatile in its 18-in-1 uses.2. **Multi-Purpose Use:** The versatility of this soap is a standout feature. I appreciate that I can use it for various purposes such as face wash, hair care, laundry, and even dishwashing. It's a convenient all-in-one solution for daily cleaning needs.3. **Gentle for Sensitive Skin:** The Baby Unscented variant, with no added fragrance, is gentle and suitable for sensitive skin. It doesn't cause irritation, making it a great option for individuals with skin sensitivities, including babies.4. **Vegan and Non-GMO:** The commitment to being vegan and non-GMO aligns with my preferences for ethical and sustainable products. It's reassuring to know that the soap is produced with these considerations in mind.5. **Effective Cleaning:** The soap effectively cleans and lathers well, providing a satisfying cleaning experience. Whether used for personal care or household tasks, it delivers on its promise of cleanliness.6. **Slight Concerns About Price:** The main concern is the relatively high price. While I understand the value of organic and ethically sourced ingredients, the cost may be a factor for some consumers, especially when comparing it to other multi-purpose soaps in the market.7. **Packaging and Size:** The 8-ounce size is convenient for various uses, but for some users, especially those who use the product regularly, a larger size might be preferred to enhance value for money.8. **Eco-Friendly Initiatives:** It's worth noting that Dr. Bronner's has a strong commitment to environmental sustainability and fair trade practices, contributing to the overall positive perception of the brand.In conclusion, Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap is a high-quality and versatile product that aligns with ethical and environmental values. I rate it four stars, with the main consideration being the price, which may impact its accessibility for a broader audience. If price is not a deterrent, this soap offers a reliable and eco-friendly option for various cleaning needs.

Leaked a little enough to bubble the label but can‚Äôt complain too much, that‚Äôs the dangers of buying online. Maybe the manufacturer should have an inside seal under the cap.

Smaller than I expected.

Nice soap - works well for cleaning retainers! Little pricey - so four stars

Fast shipping item as described

I thought it would be soapy.  It is oily.  I do not really care for it for shower soap.

Wanted a safe soap so bought this

Bad smell and excessive drying of the skin but overall quality is good

its a lot smaller then i imaged

I love ,tried it once now it s  daily usage

I prefer the bar soap version of this soap because it suds up and distributes better on a wash cloth. I find I have to use more of the liquid to get the same effect. It‚Äôs a great soap with tons of uses, just isn‚Äôt my preference.

I have tried the product in as a laundry detergent but I guess I was looking for some kind of fragrance in my laundry ( I bought the one with lavender smell) but the clothes didn‚Äôt smell anything.Then I decided to try the product as a hand soap and I love it!!! Easy to mix with water in a foam dispenser. My hands get washed, smell really good and I feel relax with the lavender fragrance.The same product is also sold with no fragrance.

Now I‚Äôm ready for camping

We love Dr Bronner soaps but were disappointed to find that there is PALM OIL in them

I use this for fabric softener in rinse cycle and great for delicate clothes. I dilute this for using anywhere you use a mild soap.

Wow this stuff is strong. Even when it‚Äôs diluted it irritates my chest and makes me wheeze and cough. A little goes a long way.

- Despite me using it incorrectly I think it a good job.- The lather isn't that strong- It did a good job at getting rid of the sweat and dirt off my skinüëçüèæ

Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Unscented variant has been a reliable and gentle choice for my baby's sensitive skin. Its fragrance-free formula is perfect for daily use, and I love the convenience of the 8-ounce size. The soap's versatility makes it useful for various purposes, from handwashing to household cleaning, and its organic and natural ingredients give me peace of mind. The pump bottle is easy to use and prevents wastage, though I wish larger quantities were available for more extended use. Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Bronner's Baby Unscented Liquid Soap for those looking for a natural and effective option for their baby and home care needs.

Quick delivery

Many of the other natural soaps have too many ingredients that I or my children are sensitive to.  This one had a few things that we were sensitive to at first, but we cleared them with allergy elimination treatments, and we now use it every day.  My kids still don't like to use it on their hair, but I do.  It does make the hair feel like there is a residue left behind in it, but there is a rinse for that which can be purchased separately.  Many people report using lemon juice, etc. for this purpose.  I have curly hair, so I don't worry about it.  As long as I just set it while it's wet and forget it, it is fine.  If I have to comb my hair out during the day, it would need to be wet down to fix it.  The rinse has been reported to fix this issue as well.  For the body... I would recommend to use it and rinse it off of sensitive areas right away as it can be irritating if it is left on for too long.  Also, do not get it in your eyes... it will burn like H.E. double hockey sticks.  Overall, I love it, and will continue to use it in the shower as well as in all my foaming soap dispensers at every sink.  I love that it is a healthy choice and is environmentally friendly.

I absolutely love this product. Good soap, one of the brands that‚Äôs safe and I prefer.

There was some product all around the bottle. I can still use it but it‚Äôs worth noting. It seemed to have bursted from the pressure cause the seal was detached in the lid.

Many uses on skin and household cleaning. Make sure to dilute and it will last forever!

I am using this soap with water to make insecticidal soap in hopes of deterring insects from house plants.  I have not had any issued with pests since starting it, but may have to give the test more time.  It is definitely more user friendly than ready-made insecticides!

The product is great. Wish the bottle was bigger.

The product is wonderful. Dr. Bronner's products have been a favorite of mine for over 20 years.  The only issue I had was with the delivery.  This took over 17 days to be delivered.  I don't know if it was production or a shipping issue.  I could have just gone to the store to purchase but I wasn't in a big hurry to get it.  I probably won't be buying it online again.

I originally bought this to bathe my ferrets. This works, I will not say otherwise. I'm pretty sure it worked significantly better than product that is labeled ferret shampoo. However, you can buy the same product at a homegoods/tj maxx that is x2 - x3 the size for $11. Shame on me for not looking. Poor pricing, but no shame on the brand.

This is perfect for sensitive skin! I have eczema on my back and this cleared it up.  The only thing that this one feels watered down from the very first time I ordered. I'm assuming they changed up the formula but it's still good

I shower and wash my hair with this soap.I do have psoriasis on my scalp and a few spots on my face and after reading so many good things about this soap I had to try it. I ended up loving it. Its a nice mild soap and I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week. As any one with psoriasis knows, this skin disease is still without a cure, it can only be treated. :( BUT, I find that using this soap really takes away the itch and flaking. The redness does fade and the ingredients seem to have a moisturizing affect as well, no more skin cracking and pain. This soap should be apart of a daily regimen to take care of yourself and keep the psoriasis from flaring up, so its no cure obviously, but its a miracle to find, its the only soap that doesn't strip your hair/skin and make it dry like the Neutrogena brand does and it leaves your skin/hair with a very light clean scent where other shampoos smell like tar. The price is very reasonable as well, hold up your thumb-that amount of Talconex (an ointment for psoriasis) cost $500.00 out the door at a pharmacy! So I like this method better. This product has met my expectations and with a healthy diet (If you have psoriasis you know about the type of food you must avoid) you don't need to break the bank with meds. I recommend it definitely.

I think it‚Äôs supposed to be unscented, idk. I cannot stand the smell. I have a super sensitive nose so maybe that‚Äôs why. It‚Äôs really faint but i hate it. It kinda smells like butt hahaha. Other than that, I love how multi purpose this soap is. I mainly use it as a spray cleaner. If you add a couple drops of essential oil to your soap and water mix, it helps with the smell. Like I said it could just be me but yeah

This soap lathers up nicely and feels great on the skin. It's also truly scentless. It is more liquid than standard soaps, but it doesn't bother me at all and a little goes a long way. I expect it will last a really long time with such a large bottle. I would however not use this for shampoo or facial cleanser because the pH is not ideal for that. Unless you plan to tone with a pH neutralizing rinse after. Castile soap has a pH of about 9, while hair and scalp oil is between 4.5-5.5, making it much more acidic. I didn't know this before trying the soap as shampoo, I realized it when it became impossible to run my fingers through my hair and no amount of conditioner would fix it. Even after it dried it felt almost sticky, and had absolutely no shine. I ended up using a lemon water mixture to regain the acidity in my hair and it was totally back to normal, the Castile soap didn't damage it or anything. The pH just didn't agree. I haven't tried this soap as dish or laundry detergent such as it claims, just as body wash but I'm very happy with it as that

I really like this product. I bought it unscented for added versatility even though so far I've only used it mixed with water for handwashing. I've heard (and the bottle says) it can be used for so much more than that.I've had friends that take only this with them while traveling as a replacement for toothpaste, body wash, face wash, hand soap and shampoo. I'm kind of a picky traveler and need more than just the bare essentials.. as in it's always a surprise to me when my suitcase is NOT over 50lbs.But I think I could be okay using it as a face wash and body wash. In fact, I could see a little lavender essential oil (or whatever oils you're into) added to it making it really nice as a body wash; it lathers very nicely without being heavy if that makes any sense. I also hear it's nice as toothpaste with a little tea tree oil added for a minty freshness. If I wasn't such a wuss I would try it out. Maybe I'll take a little bottle of it camping one of these days and give it a go.

This is my first time using Castile soap and I will probably never go back! It is such a versatile product with so many uses! So far I have: clean dishes, used it as a body wash and a shave gel, a hand soap and a face cleaner. I can't wait to try it as a detergent and a floor cleaner .. So many great recipes to be find online for this environmentally (and vegetarian) profit! Also, initially it does seem very pricy, but for also every use, you are diluting it. The only downside would be it does burn your eyes so be careful if you use it on your face and despite what many people say, not good in a DIY shampoo. It coats your hair with an oil consistency and does not come out.. It looked like I did not just wash my hair and have me dandruff. Some people swear by it, and good for you if it works for you, but I am sticking with an organic shampoo. Also, for this particular scent (baby mild aloe) would be it has virtually  no scent (which I think it is not supposed to and you may like that)! Overall, a very good product and I will be repurchasing when I run out (probably in bulk :) ).

Small thought. check the size before you buy

This item was exactly as described, but a little higher than my local store. I have used Bronner products for many years and bought this particular item to use in DIY herbal skin care products. Can't wait to get started!

I bought this to make some foamy soap and it works wonderful. My only complaint is that it was packaged with a damaged lid. When I got it the top of the lid was broken and I couldn't find it in the bag. Thankfully it was sealed and didn't leak. Since they don't do returns, I could not contact the sellers. Overall I like the product, but I am disappointed with the packaging.

I‚Äôve used Dr Bronners castille soap for years but only recently used the scent free gentle soap. It great for washing your clothes or cleanup while traveling or as a shampoo or even to brush your teeth. I seem to be more skin sensitive as I have gotten older but this has worked well for me and was recommended by my dermatologist.

Jug was a bit sticky from shipping but not broken. We use this for everything. There are recipes on the side of the bottle for a bunch of different uses.

I been using Dr Bronner's unscented soap for my entire family since 2014. This is the first time, I see a major color change in the product. Usually the unscented version is mild and has a very light brown color. This time, its a heavy color. Almost like wild honey.It does lather well; but still little bit concerned about the color. Hope its not a bad stock.

The product is great but you can definitely find it in a larger size for a better price. If you are looking for convenience this is it. If you are looking for a good deal, go to your local grocery store

Since I‚Äôve started using this in the shower I‚Äôve noticed my skin is not as dry and flaky as it used to be. I‚Äôm not great about moisturizing, so a soap that doesn‚Äôt dry my skin is a welcome discovery. I just put a little on loofa and it foams right up as I scrub. There‚Äôs no heavy perfumed scent, just a light clean scent.

I want to like this soap more than i do. It is great for body soap and hands. While washing it feels wierd but no suds and you dry super fast. Leaves a nice softness to your hands but not oily. So 100% perfect for camper life. Very little water needed to rinse. It works okay for dishes as well. Worked good as far as i can tell for handwashing masks. However i hate it in my hair. It feels heavy and nasty. Feels u washed and gummy and frizzes and tangles. I purchased the hair rinse as well and it doesn't help. So overall it's great for anything except hair. (Do not have hard water).

I like it

I‚Äôm Done buying B&BW, it‚Äôs overpriced and has many chemicals. I can now make my own for much less with this soap! I use it to make foaming hand soap that smells great after adding essential oils of my choice.

The Baby version of Dr. Bronner's isn't completely odorless, it's rather a mild, neutral sort of scent. I find that liquid castile soap is used well for mopping floors, and washing hands, face, and body and even smaller pets. I would not recommend it for washing your hair or shaving as it doesn't provide the same thick lather or lubricant feeling as traditional products.If you purchase the gallon size, ask the seller to seal the container tightly and package the item well. The first time I ordered this, the bottle came open and spilled the contents in transit; by the time I received the box, which had other ordered items in it, the bottle wasn't even in the box. The second time I ordered it (separately, not in a bundle of other orders), it arrived with tape over the lid and a plastic bag around the bottle (inside a box), but the bottle had still leaked onto the box. The seller / shipper just need to be extra mindful.

Used as mentioned above. Has worked well for our dog's sensitive skin. Itching has slowed tremendously. A bit high on price though. Found the soap at a local store for about $8 less for the same size bottle.

The cap's flip hinge was broken when I received it and I see others have had the same complaint. The plastic is too brittle. A better cap is needed for use, too. It's difficult to control the flow. The product itself is excellent.

Clean skin well.

This is my first time using Dr Bronner's. I got it unscented so I could use it in my personal areas which are sensitive. I don't really care for the scent of the soap...it smells like hospital soap to me. I like how it cleans, but the next time I buy it I will purchase the lavendar scent.

I've been using Dr. Bronner's Liquid Soap since childhood, and it continues to be my top choice even now in my 30s. What truly sets it apart is the use of natural and organic ingredients. Unlike many commercial soaps with synthetic chemicals, Dr. Bronner's uses pure, organic oils such as coconut, olive, and hemp. This makes it gentle on all skin types, including sensitive skin like mine. Another fantastic aspect is its versatility. Dr. Bronner's isn't just for hand or body washing; it‚Äôs an all-in-one product. I‚Äôve used it for everything from washing my hair to cleaning around the house, even washing my pets. This multifunctionality makes it incredibly cost-effective and reduces the need for multiple cleaning products. Additionally, the soap is environmentally friendly, with biodegradable ingredients and packaging made from 100% recycled plastic! In terms of performance, the soap lathers well and leaves my skin clean but not stripped of its natural oils. The scents, derived from essential oils, are refreshing yet not overpowering. My favorites are Baby (unscented), Almond, Peppermint, and Lavender. Overall, Dr. Bronner's Liquid Soap is a superior choice for anyone seeking a high-quality, natural, and versatile soap. If you‚Äôre looking for a soap that excels in every way, Dr. Bronner's is definitely worth trying!

This is the best soap for many applications if properly diluted according to type of use.  Excellent hand soap, wonderful for a no rinse wash up.  No issues with the unscented on my skin.  The key is proper dilution listed on each bottle label.  Very economical as even the 8 oz lasts quite a while.

This review is my experience; not intended as medical advice. scent is true to unscented, skin feels soft and refreshment indeed! Value wise check prices elsewhere see what works best for you. Appearance packed neat!

Was recommended this to clean out my piercing while it was healing and it's worked so well!! It feels dry when you rinse off but it has kept my nose sterile for 8 months and going. Great value too, I still have plenty (granted I only use a bit on my nose, because it DOES dry you out)

I use this baby soap on sensitive skin areas and it's great. There is no scent. This bottle was smaller than I realized for the price but that's on me for not checking the oz. Would recommend but all bodies are different.

My girls have sensitive skin, and this product works good for them. It's concentrated, so I dilute it to 1/4 cup per 8 oz of water and it works great. If you want to add some flare to it you can always add scented (pure) oils to it too. It's versatile. Can be used for many different things. They use safe ingredients, anfmd it's strong enough to clean like I need for my busy girls!

Tik Tok made me buy and it was worth it. For someone who lives is TX and sweats quite a bit, this soap has been amazing to combat heavy sweating and smell. It‚Äôs the perfect antibacterial soap when you need a good cleaning. No smell which is great for those who have sensitive skin. Too much will cause your skin to feel dry so just be sure to dilute with well with water and follow up with a moisturizing soap/body wash.

Love how gentle yet effective this liquid soap is.  It was recommended to me for aftercare for recent tattoo work I'd gotten.  Definitely does the job of cleaning the tattoo without any harsh chemicals or irritants.  Felt great to be able to wash my tattoo several times per day and not have to worry about this soap drying it out or irritating it.  Would highly recommend.

Read many articles that describe the many uses for this pure castile liquid soap. I agree with all of the articles that this soap is highly effective, especially when it comes to cleaning oils and lubricants off of skin and other items. When used in a spray bottle as a cleaner, a little goes a LONG way!

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs been happening to me but I‚Äôve been so itchy and dry probably this Florida chlorine water! Nothing was working until this! Saved my life! I‚Äôm shocked at how it has no scent yet I feel so clean after

The fresh feeling your girl will have after using this is wonderful. This is an all over body wash but I purchased it  after asking my doctors questions about vaginal irritation from others. I highly recommend this product.

Bought this for the express purpose of dousing Japanese Beetles. Mix up a sprayer and spray directly on the plant. I used it on my Virginia Creeper. Bye bye bugs!

Great use in flower beds to eliminate beetles. Just be careful on using to much you don‚Äôt want to burn the leaves

Liked the very minimal fragrance and sudsy cleaning. also the way it totally rinses off hair and skin with zero residue.

I used an online recipe for a homemade pesticide for the tint white flies attacking dad's Hibiscus shrubs.It works great & eradicated the white flies each spring & summer

Great for bathing baby, no harmful chemicals

We love this brand of Castile soap for making our own foaming hand soaps around the house.  I should have noticed when purchasing how small this bottle was.  My family laughed when it arrived and it was a fraction of the size of the bottles I typically buy at the store.  Still gets the job done (for a month or so at least).

This one of the best unscented soaps I use.

I must admit cleaning so many other products. The fact that I‚Äôm taking a chance putting on my sensitive skin was a chance I was willing to take. Glad I did because this product was amazing.

I like this one as it has no fragrant and the baby likes it.

Used just a few drops at a time while on my 2-week camping trip for washing my camping cooking stuff. I felt much better about draining the suds into the environment.

A little goes a long way! Not scented, suds well.

I am using this 2 Tablespoons at a time, and mixed with distilled water and some essential oil, and using a foaming soap dispenser, this works very well. It saves our family money and is very gentle.

Always a winner. Use it for everything. All body parts. Very gentle yet effective. Nice knowing it is safe without extra additives and scents

i use it on my body, good to get odor off, not drying like soap. i use on vegetables, as recommended and no after taste.

Product as promised.Made foaming hand soap with essential oil per Dr. Bronner‚Äôs product use recommendations. Economical.

It‚Äôs pure Castile soap and great for skin.

Customer satisfaction

I bought this to make up some foaming hand soaps without excess chemicals and fragrance. Dr. Bronners worked excellent with no skin irritation.

I use it in my motion hand soap dispensers. It foams nicely

Excellent natural product

Cleans my body and does it without harsh chemicals.

Used on my dog with apple cider vinegar and an essential oil for fleas. Worked perfect!!

I believe this soap is safe for babies, but let‚Äôs talk plant babies here!! Have any issues with pests that you need to treat and plants/pots that need a good cleaning? Look no further. Many people use dish soap, but really this is much safer! Better ingredients and perfect to mix up with some water and neem oil in a sprayer if you have plants that need treatment. Quality product, trustworthy, highly recommended.

I use this in my garden mixed with water to spray on pests as a natural way to get rid of them that won't hurt me or my animals

Perfect for my efforts to create healthier cleaning solutions for my home/family

Gentle on the skin and I am soooo sensitive in certain areas. Nothing ever works but this worked the best! Does exactly what it says it does. No scent just like I needed. All natural.

Cleaned jacket in only one washing. Has some gasoline spilled on it and after washing smell was gone.

I love using this product for all our household cleaning. Smells great two.

This is amazing stuff.

I've used this body soap exclusively for 50 years. I couldn't believe the shipment time! I ordered in the morning and it was delivered that afternoon!

This helps so much

I made DIY toilet paper spray in place of flushable wipes. Perfect ingredient!

Nice small bottle of castile soap with no scent added.  Hard to find as most grocery stories have large bottle with scents.  Very pleased.

I never need to use conditioner anymore.  Hair feels soft.

Got this to keep the Beatles off our grape vines. Mix 2-3 tablespoons with a quart of water in a spray bottle. Spray directly on the Beatles & it disables them.

This has a light earthy smell when using in the shower. Probably from the hemp. I love that scent. It goes away quickly.  This takes all my deodorant gunk off my pits and leaves me squeaky clean. I tried the peppermint one and that leaves a Christmas tree smell and people will comment and that‚Äôs no bueno. So this is great for people who like this product but don‚Äôt want a lasting scent besides their deodorant and cologne. There‚Äôs also no irritation with the product which the peppermint did have. I‚Äôm happy. I ignore the interesting to say the least writing on the bottle. I‚Äôm not easily offended so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

I use this for everything!

I recently got my first tattoo. The artist provided me with traditional follow up care instructions:1. Wash with Dial Anti-bacterial soap2. Use Aquafor for the first two weeks3. Use lotion for the last two weeksI found the dial soap to be very drying to the skin which exacerbated the itching once that phase started and the Aquafor faded the tattoo. Artist tell you not to use petroleum but petrolatum which is 41% of Aquafor, is a petroleum based product. It‚Äôs supposed to be a refined derivative but for me, it‚Äôs still petroleum based. Didn‚Äôt like A&D either. Too greasy. So, after doing extensive research, I found that some tattoo artist recommended Dr. Bonnet‚Äôs castille soap and magic balm for tattoo healing. So, I purchased the castille soap, the sugar soap, and the magic balm. I am VERY happy with the performance of these products. The castille and sugar soap cleans the tattoo very well, getting rid of the dead skin, while being very gentle on the skin. The magic balm is FANTASTIC!!! It truly helps with minimizes the itching, which for me is the absolute worst part of the tattoo healing process. It‚Äôs also moisturizes the skin without being greasy. Absolutely love it!!! I would recommend these products for tattoo healing or just ordinary skin care.

I really  like it is considerate  so adding a sm amount & water put in a hand soap bottle it foamed up so good this will last you along time very soft on hands cleansing good not a very strong scent at all

I don't like to give negative reviews, but here it is. I have tried to swallow these over several days. 90% of the time I cannot and spit each one out. I have never had trouble swallowing pills. These tablets start dissolving instantly.  Fortunately, I have another brand. So I will continue to try, one by one. Eventually, I will discard the whole bottle, I am sure. This is a highly rated product, so many seem to benefit, but it is not for me.

When I read the comments I was very hopeful that this product would work for me. I have had GI issues my whole life, seen more doctors than I can count and have taken every medication that was given to me; nothing worked. It's "normal" for me to go 12-14 days without a BM. Every doctor just says "here, try this" and shoves medication in my face. Over the last 2 years I have been trying to find something that is more natural that I can take long term. I thought this product would be that miracle pill and I was disappointed. For the last 8 days I have taken 6 of these pills PER DAY. Two when I wake up, two before lunch, and two before dinner because it says to take on an empty stomach. Zero results. Some of the comments said it took two weeks for it to work for them, so I will finish out the bottle in hopes of having the same results. I'm glad it worked for others. If not, I will be back to taking Dr. Bo's cleansing pills....which are NOT healthy long term, but, they produce a BM within 24-48 hours after taking them.

I have been using Banyan Botanicals for the past seven or eight years. It has always worked, and I have loved it. My most recent delivery, however, is in new packaging and is clearly a new formulation. The pills are smaller and darker, and so far have they‚Äôve had absolutely no meaningful impact on my digestive system. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm taking nothing. I am going to try it for another week or so, and if it still isn‚Äôt working, I will return it. I have relied on this product for such a long time to keep me regular, I am really not sure what I‚Äôm going to do without it. So disappointing.

Since the product has so many positive reviews, there must be something wrong with my experience!I have been taking two Sennosides (25mg) tablets per day for several months of a generic brand to great effect. However, when I read the label carefully and discovered one is not supposed to take it continuously for so long, I started looking for an alternative. Given my background, I searched for an Ayurvedic alternative and settled on Triphala. After additional research about various brands of Triphala and user reviews, it appeared that Banyan Botanicals Triphala Tablets is a good candidate.As suggested on the Banyan Botanicals' website, I started with 2 hard-to-swallow tablets per night. After seeing no effect, I added a 3rd one. Still no effect, I made it 4 tablets every night, and still nothing.There are so many 4 star reviews of the product, I imagine my experience is unique. I also think, even if 4 tablets dose had worked, it would be prohibitively expensive alternative. It is great that it is working out for most of the users.

After reading all of the reviews I was so optimistic about this supplement but unfortunately it did not work for me at all. Not even a little bit. It was as if I didn‚Äôt even take anything. Started with one in the morning and before bed and worked my way up to FOUR at a time and still nothing. This is SO disappointing because I obviously can‚Äôt get my money back. What a waste.

This is such a waste of money. I don't know why they changed the packaging from white to Green. It looks like Formula also got changed. I bought 180 tablets, got zero benefits this time, and had to cancel my subscription. I used to buy 180 tablets with that old packaging which is for 90 tablets now. Those were good but not this one.

I bought this hoping it would help regulate my bowls & had a little hope that I might lose a few pounds, but I have not had either!  I've been taking it for 3 weeks now and nothing.  The instructions say to take 1-2 pills once or twice a day - I have been taking 2 in the morning & 2 in the evening - that's 4 pills a day for the last 3 weeks & no results. These pills smell bad and are had to swallow, so needless to say I think this product is a scam :(  I would not recommend this product for bowl regularity or weight loss.  Metamucil is the best thing ever for regular bowl movements.  I'm still working on finding a good weight loss supplement because diet & exercise does not seem to be working for me either.

I only took one of these impossible to swallow pills and thought it was going to get stuck sideways in my throat. There isn't any coating. Also the descriptions says Banyan will accept returns but Amazon does't allow returns on this product. I wasted $35

Purchased to try a new brand of triphala. Been using India triphala for years with no problem just good results. Huge mistake purchasing this brand. Tried recommended dosage on the bottle and was constipated for 3 days. So then backed down to one pill per day. Had cramps, rectal leakage ( wiping bum 10 times a days till i was raw.) for 3 weeks.

I tried 4 each day and nothing. I requested refund.

THese didn't work to help my IBS-C

On week #3 with this product; the jury is still out I suppose.  I'll continue, I bought the BIG bottle, and see if anything changes10/23 Made No Difference at all . . . Discontinued using this product

they don‚Äôt dissolve, no matter how much water you drink

Totally ineffective

Did nothing for me... started getting breakouts on lower chin the very next day.. tried for 2 weeks expecting the breakouts to vanish once i get used to it.. No Luck!!  I have been using triphala of another brand for a while and it worked perfect.. i just ordered this brand seeing all the good reviews and ended up in blemished skin..  gonna switch back to the old brand..

I know a lot of people recommend this supplement; but, I, through process of elimination, have discovered that it causes abdomen bloating, swelling and discomfort in my system.  Just because it is ‚Äúorganic‚Äù and ‚Äúdetoxification‚Äù claimed, don‚Äôt assume it is good for ‚Äúyou‚Äù.

Doesnt work at all. I started taking 2 tablets a day and it didnt work so i increased it to 3-4 tablets throughout the day but all it did was make me bloat and constipated. (I work out and drink plenty of fluids)

I have been taking this product along with tranquil mind and healthy vata sinceSeptember 2013 based on a recommendation from a licensed practitioner.Just spent 5 days in hospital and have been diagnosed with toxin induced hepatitis.Get your liver checked regularly if you are taking thus supplement.

It was already opened ! Seal broken !

Did not work for me at all. Another waste of time and money.

I started taking this product per the directions and on the third or fourth day, I saw an insect inside INSECT A LIVE INSECT inside that popped out along with the tablets. I stopped taking these after that

Produced no results for me.  Contacted banyan and they said could take 6 weeks.  Returning

Sorry did not work for me actually stopped me from going to the bathroom regularly. Had to stop taking it after ten days.

Waste of money. Did nothing at all for me.Shipped and received quickly though

I saw no change at all after 6 months of taking Triphala. Did not work after AM and PM doses daily.

Didn't work very well for me.

It upset my stomach

Didnt know the difference

not effective

After taking 1/day for three weeks it gave me very dry mouth. I've never had this problem before. Although it may have helped my digestion, it was not enough to make dealing with dry mouth worth it. Now I am left to clean up the mess triphala has caused.

This didn't work for me at all. Gave me nausea and actually constipated me more. I think I was more regular before taking these tablets.The items was packaged well and delivered on time. I have ordered other items from Banyan Botanicals and was pretty satisfied. My rating reflects my experience with the product and not the seller.

Poor quality and it does nothing for me except possibly make me nauseous

Good product for digestive health

Great product, but research it first. It flushes out toxins, but meds you take may also come out.

This product was recommended to me at a yoga training. It's very good for helping maintain regularity.

I have been taking Triphala on the regular basis for the past 10 years. This brand sells them in tablets and powder, which works for me since I dont think it is a good idea to take many capsules frequently. This definitely helps with normalizing the process of evacuation. It does say not take it when pregnant. This brand never disappoints.

I am not sure it working for my son or not. I gave him regularly 3 months I didn't see much difference. But it didn't do any harm also.

An excellent digestive aid.

I buy this product on a regular basis.  It helps me and my 16 yr old daughter stay regular naturally without any cramps or quick runs to the bathroom.  Very gentle and natural.

these tablets are different than the ones in  the white bottle.  They tend to crumble which is quite unpleasant

This product is incredible

Cleanse

nothing to say about this

I did not notice a difference and I used it for a few months however I was only taking 1 a day so perhaps you need to take more than 1.

Pills are not of same shape. toomany broken pieces.

Did not help

I bought this Ayurvedic remedy to help with my digestive issues (mainly gas and bloating). I did a lot of research on the company and really feel they are a good choice for clean, organic herbs. I use another Banyan Botanicals product to help me stay asleep called "I Sleep Soundly" and I do feel that that works. However, I'm not sure I have taken the Triphala for long enough-- or perhaps there are other issues going on contributing to my "airy" digestion-- because I haven't seen much of a difference yet. But I am happy to know that the three herbs included have a myriad of other benefits, so I know I am at least getting something out of it. Mainly, they are potent antioxidants protecting me from free radicals.

I am a heavy triphala user and have used several products from the past.This is authentic but don‚Äôt see the potency mentioned when consumed.Double check date of mfg before opening.do not accept products that are > 3 to 4 months.Mine came up with an acceptable mfg date.

I like the product however there needs to be some type of quality assurance.  The bottle I returned looked like it had been run over by a truck.  And, someone made the decision to package it and send anyway.

I tried this for detox purposes and to help with constipation and candida....Didn't do a thing for me, very disappointed. Found out through a little research that you really need to take the powdered form of triphala if you want the mild laxative effect...it is much much stronger...just mix in a glass of warm water 2 times per day.

The Triphala works well for constipation, but I was very nauseous and had some pain in my abdomen.

I'm not sure if it's working well since my BMs are still loose. My nutritionist/doctor says just to eat the right foods that are easy on the stomach, and to make some homemade probiotics. Hope this helps.

I previously ordered a different brand. These seem to work ok, but you must hurry with the water as they break apart in your mouth quickly and then a little miore difficult to wash down., Haven't used them very long

Purchased to go along with an Ayurvedic cleanse I was trying with a book The Prime, but not really much difference for me since I have good normal bowel habits already.

It works good but I have to find a better brand without any rice fillers.

Not as effective as some other Triphala

Ok, I will use it until the bottle is empty but I do not see any difference in weight loss as originally thought.

Still experimenting with this.  Was told it was very mild, but caused colon cramps when I took it.

it doesnt work for me.

It's Ok, but don't really notice a difference !!

NOTICED NOTHING

Not what I expected.

not a good product

I've been taking this for some time now, and haven't noticed any effects on my regularity. I took four yesterday with the hopes of some nice, Triphala-facilitated XL BMs, but no luck.This is the first Triphala product I've tried. And the little bit of scientific research on the three plants that make up triphala pretty much says its mild, safe, has no appreciable side effects for most people, and may have a two way laxative effect through peristalic stimulation (stimulant laxative) and a bulking agent. I think loose triphala or encapsulated might possibly be better than these pressed tablets. They are smooth, nice looking, and easy to swallow, but they look like they could pass right through some people.I'll continue to take it, and maybe it will work when I get up to ten tablets a day! Or I might try pulverizing these hard tablets with mortar and pestle and see if that works.Got this product discounted for a review that honestly describes my experience with the product.

well, at the least... i can say i have taken a whole bottle with no side effects

I was told by a friend who is into ayurveda to try this.  It really didn't do anything for me besides give me gas pains.  I am sure it is a wonderful product for some, just not for me.  I sent it back and they politely refunded my money.

It gave me stomach cramps but it did encourage a bm

Really does what it says.  No more comments are needed!

not sure it works

It's more effective than other brands I've tried. The only con is occasionally a pill or two on the bottom are broken which probably occurs during shipping.

So far, I feel no different after taking these for a while -- maybe digestion is a little better.I guess time will tell if there's a long term benefit.

works okay

Helped with intestinal discomfort

Good quality!

Use this product daily

As you may well know, the modern diet and (lack of) exercise regimen can put restrictions on your bowel movements. And bowel blockages, even the unintentionally self caused ones, can be deadly, not to mention they can be awfully painful. Fiber therapies such as psyllium husk can be downright bombastic, and the brutal effects can come over you in a very unpleasant and unexpected manner; pain, almost enough to match the aforementioned bowel blockages; gas strong enough to tranquilize a triceratops (and who's to say how many homosapiens as well); uncomfortable, abdomen distending bloating, ugh. And, if you're blue collar like me, chances are that you could literally be stuck serving customers while a hot gurgling mess threatens to reign terror upon the masses. Meanwhile, you are left clenching your cheeks and praying for your luck to hold out long enough for a mad dash to the restroom- not to mention long enough to get your drawers down. Nobody wants to be that guy! Triphala can help ease the strain a bit more naturally and much more, shall I say, predictably. I love this stuff. I had concerns that the supplement might result in explosive urges or cramps, but it didn't and I'm glad. I take it at night and the resulting b.m. is just smooth and easy.From the label; Triphala is a traditional Ayurvedic rejuvenation formula that promotes deep cleansing of the GI tract and supports the proper functions of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and genitourinary systems.Product contains a proprietary blend ofAmalaki fruit(Emblica officialinus), Bibhitaki fruit(Terminalia belerica), Haritaki fruit(Terminalia chabula)Additional ingredients include; organic maltodextrin, and silicon dioxide (from natural sources) gluten free, dairy free, soy free, 100 percent vegetarian.I'm hooked! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

This is a new supplement for me.  I did some research and found out a little bit about Triphala.  Here is some of what I discovered.15 Triphala BenefitsImproves digestion.Alleviates and corrects constipation.Tones the gastrointestinal tract.Triphala powder cleans bowel and normalizes the digestive system.Purifies the blood.Removes excess fats out of the bodyNurtures voice quality.Strengthens hair roots.Enrich hair color.Improves eyesight.It has various liver, blood cleansing and nutritional properties.It contains anthraquinones that help in stimulating peristalsis.Rich in one of the powerful antioxidants, polyphenols, which reduces oxidative stress on the body.High amount of vitamin C builds immunity.Maintains good reproductive health in both genders, nourishes and strengthens the respiratory tract and the lungs.I decided that with all of those benefits, this would be a good supplement to try.  I am happy with the company and am thankful that the tablets are organic.This product was provided complementary  in exchange for my honest review.

Triphala is very good for help. It's beneficial for - natural internal cleansing, nourishiment of tissues, healthy digestion and absorption and natural antioxidant. I like quality of the product.

Easy to swallow and use taste decent and does the job for me

I used to take Metamucil, and my doctor of oriental medicine recommended this herb. I am happy with this supplement and so glad I found something that doesn't have the sugar.

I will be a lifelong user of this stuff. I developed gallstones after my 2nd pregnancy & kept being told I would have to remove my gallbladder to be comfortable again. I was determined to keep it and tried everything from gallstone flushes, apple cider vinegar, lemon water, other supplements, coca cola etc. Coffee enemas helped expedite the healing & I will continue to do them, but this stuff changed it all for me and is the reason I can eat eggs (yolk) again, which caused the worst attacks for me. I take 2 every night and can eat completely normal (any food) and have not had an attack of any sort, since (and has kept me regular). I'm not kidding when I say I will take this for life. Thanks, Banyan Botanicals!Update Sept 2019: Almost a year later and still working for me. I have even slowed done how frequently I take them. Which I did then start to feel like I had a slowing of my digestive tract for the first time in a year (and started taking more Triphala again but still didn‚Äôt see my normal results) and so it was suggested to temporarily switch out Triphala for Amalaki, which apparently sometimes can be necessary with the changes of season. The amalaki helped within a week. SO, point being, if you feel like the Triphala starts to lose its effectiveness, maybe try switching to Amalaki for a bit (I also stuck to Banyan brand for that). After going through a bottle of Amalaki, I‚Äôm back to Triphala now and is working per usual again.Update Oct 2020: Still using, still no gallstone returns. 2 per day (sometimes missing days). Occasionally will increase frequency intake if I have been on holiday or feeling heavy in my digestive tract. Will continue to use.Update 2022: Yup, still using. No issues with gallbladder. Pretty much the only thing I do for health maintenance with gallbladder/digestive tract, aside from pre&probiotics.

I don't use triphala all the time but gosh it is amazing when I use it. I'm not as invested in ayuervedic  healing as I'd like to be but I looked up how triphala can help the digestive system and detox. I love that I can take it without food. They're on the bigger side and I always take it with water. Whenever I can tell my digestive system is lagging, upset, constipated, or I'm just not having good bowel movements, I'll take two triphala tablets in the morning when I wake up and it works wonders for me. It's important to note that at least from my experience, triphala is settle. It's not like a laxative and that's what I love about it. It's never had me rushing to the bathroom with diarrhea. Triphala stimulates my digestive system to have better bowel movements. So like a couple hours later it will usually do it's thing but I've never felt an urgency with triphala the way that laxatives hit ya. I don't use it all the time but when I run out, I will be buying it again.

I‚Äôve tried a few different brands of Triphala before, and so far this is my favorite. I really like that it‚Äôs just compressed material and there is no gel capsule for your body to have to digest. While I don‚Äôt mind the gel capsules, if I can avoid the extra material, I‚Äôd prefer it. These are a nice tapered shape, thin, easy to swallow, and have a pleasant, albeit minor, smell.The method I‚Äôve settled on for using triphala is to take one of these tablets at night right before I go to bed, just with water. The next day I notice a positive difference, although nothing very major, which is good. Everything just moves along easily. When I first started taking triphala, the following morning my stomach would feel slightly queasy, almost on the verge of a stomach ache, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. After a week or so, I stopped having that feeling. I take maybe 2 or 3 a week, not every single night. I find that taking 1 every couple or so days works just fine for me, and I don‚Äôt really have a need to take it more often. While I know this varies from person to person, I have a long history of stomach issues and taking this at this interval seems to produce the best result, such that everything seems to function much better than I‚Äôm used to.I‚Äôve also read the claims that you can use triphala as a way to lose inches around your stomach. While I don‚Äôt take it for this purpose and assumed it was all false claims, I do have to say that I notice my belt fitting looser and I need to tighten it more than normal. I haven‚Äôt weighed myself to see what kind of difference there may be, and it‚Äôs most likely just water weight, but it was a pleasant surprise.

Small tablets that are easy to swallow

This is one of my favorite supplements and we consider it a sort of secret weapon. I started taking Triphala about 15 years ago, as a substitute for habit forming teas or the disgusting salt water flush while doing Master Cleanser cycles of up to 21 days. It worked like a charm, and always does for us. No cramping, no sudden dashes for the loo, just a productive morning when taken before bedtime. I have taken a few brands but honestly I notice a difference in efficacy when taking Banyan's triphala. I have taken quite a few of their herbal blends, and I love their oils and balms as well, just a lovely company overall.I also finally convinced my father to try this after battling terrible constipation his entire life, which docs just basically gave up on other than suggesting surgery. Well, like me, he's not a surgery guy unless it's life or death, so he just suffered with this since childhood but I finally managed to get him to try this, after he reported no change whatsoever from a Triphala tea he tried. I explained that the tea was likely not strong enough and he should try these. He did, and sheepishly reported the very next day that he had a normal, comfortable bowel movement! He now swears by this and wishes he had tried it sooner, and do so I. Better late than never, but this is something I recommend everyone either take as a regular supplement or keep on hand for when things are just not moving.

I start taking 2 tablets 1/16/23 at night before going to bed for 6 weeks. I went from 189 lbs to 164lbs. I was shocked when I went to the doctor and took my weight.When I bought Banyan Triphala, I wanted to clean my gut I did not have diarrhea in the morning if fact the first two days I hardly had bowel movements but the third day I notice bulk feces where I felt good after each time I went to the bathroom.After a week or so I was going to the bathroom at lease twice a day normally. I tried to loose weight before but wasn't successful I think I'll continue for 10 weeks and stop. ( I read that somewhere it said give your body rest)

I've been using Triphala by Banyan for about 6 months now, as prescribed by my Ayurvedic Practitioner, which is one tablet before bed (two tabs, if I feel inclined to do so). Like most alternative medicine, Triphala is no "magic" pill that will "fix" people's ailments overnight. Instead, it takes time and consistency to be effective, in combination with the fact that each person has a different constitution AND way of living (eating and general health) that may effect results.For me, I no longer struggle with constipation; to be specific without being gross, Triphala has made elimination so easy and normal and *complete!* that I seriously feel like I have lost garbage weight just by having effective elimination every day.  In addition, Triphala seems to help with mental clarity and a good night's rest.Triphala may cause vivid dreams for some people for about the first week or two of taking -this is normal and harmless. It happened to me; they weren't nightmares --they were trippy, vivid dreams, like a movie all night. This stopped after about a week for me.My mother who is 65 and has diabetes and high blood pressure began taking Triphala for constipation and she swears by it now. She takes two pills before bed. She even tries giving it away as gifts to people because of how much it has changed her life; she use to call the bathroom the "torcher chamber" because of constipation.

Again, a Banyan Botanicals product I‚Äôve purchased several times over the years. If I overeat, I appreciate the gentle natural  assist of Triphala ~*

I have taken Banyan Botanical‚Äôs triphala for quite some time.  Triphala was recommended to me for gut health by an Ayurvedic practitioner, and I do find it very helpful.  I have tried other brands of triphala over the years, but Banyan‚Äôs works best for me.  I will order it straight from Banyan if I have enough items to get their free shipping.  But if I run out before I need other items, I order from Amazon prime as the price is the same and it ships for free.

Very good

2 or 3 tablets per day for IBS-C and after a few days of taking them, expect to have comfortable and consistent results! Not like the harsh medications and laxatives that cause gas, cramping and diarrhea that disrupts your day (i.e., can't leave the house diarrhea!) This brand of triphala is gentle and makes me feel like I can live a normal, predictable life!

Great product ! I found it in a Reddit forum. Lemme tell you It does exactly what I needed it to do it's life changing. & that's an understatement. If you have any problems with consistently using the restroom or any GI issues definitely give this a try!! I will forever buy Triphala !

Helps in my regular in the morning. Need to take 4 to 5 tables in the morning.

These are a find for sure if you struggle with movements! This has changed my body so much and I am regular for the first time!

I take pain medication on a regular basis and often have constipation issues because of it. I‚Äôve tried lots of fiber supplements and other natural remedies with little to no results. Since trying these I‚Äôve been very regular. Highly recommend.

My guts were so bad from antibiotic‚Äôs disrupting my gut flora. Used Pre-script assist pro biotic‚Äôs along with a DGL powder, and aloe Vera juice. When I added Triphala 2 a day felt a difference the first week.

Take just 1 daily before breakfast and within a day or two it started working and works daily.  Impressed with its efficacy.

There was a bit of a slow start with this item, but after several days the pills worked very effectively to regulate my system. They continue to work now. I started with three pills at night and two in the morning. I am now down to two at night and one in the morning.

This works better than my blood pressure med. I took this instead of my BP meds and my blood pressure is so much better. Also my hair stopped falling out.  Will continue to buy. üòä

I've tried many different digestive enzyme supplements and other methods to relieve bloating and indigestion, but THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT WORKS. My elimination is FINALLY regular again, I don't get bloated after each meal, my relationship with food is healthy again, and I simply feel amazing every day!I take 2 tablets in the morning and 2 in the evening with a glass of warm water, as suggested in Banyan Botanicals website and Ayurveda guide.Thank you for making this wonderful product. I'll buy another bottle again soon!

Triphala is a great detoxifier. I use it a on a daily basis for months now. So far, it doesn't have any contraindications with any other medicine. I highly recommend taking one per day (at least). I take one in the morning with breakfast and one at the evening with a dinner. If I have any issues with constipation I take two at the evening with a dinner and that would normally take care of all the digestive issues for me. Highly recommended!!!

I like this product because it does not give you cramps like laxatives can do. I take 2 a day in the morning and it works within a couple hours. The only thing I do not like is they are dry. The pills do not have any coating on them and it makes it a little difficult to swallow and gets stuck in your mouth and throat. Other than that I would recommend.

I was suffering very badly from leaky gut and I had no hope. I tried lots of different supplements that my doctor recommended but nothing was really working. I have lamented probiotics I took colostrum I took deglycerized licorice root and all these things help but they didn't cure the problem. then I started taking triphala and my symptoms vanished pretty soon after I started working it into my daily regimen. it works great as a maintenance supplement but also helped me when I would have acute upset stomach from my leaky gut. Very happy with this product!

There's an old Ayurvedic saying in India: "no parents, no problem...take triphala". These three herbs combined cover a lot of mileage for our good. I particularly like that these are organic and tablet form, so you get to taste them for a moment (you're supposed to with astringent herbs). I studied Ayurveda and am familiar with this brand. It's a more conscious company, generally speaking. A little pricey compared to others, but I feel assured that it's organic and made well, so I buy it. Triphala works really well for constipation, general detoxification & to take when traveling. Best taken before bed with warm water (2 tabs).Other uses: boost immunity, weight loss, when health is waning.

I have suffered from constipation for most of my life. I even had an incomplete colonoscopy due to it...and I'm in my 30s. I never took the nadty synthetic crap the Drs pushed on me. Im always looking for natural products and ways to heal ect. I finally went to an Ayurvedic practitioner and she recommend this exact brand(she had it stocked in her office) Right away I was going. She recommended I take Triphala first thing in the morning and before dinner. I will be taking Triphala forever. It works. Ayurveda is an ancient practice and we need to see more of its wisdom incorporated in Western medicine. No nasty and unwanted side effects like you would get from the synthetic junk Drs prescribe.

Only quality products by this company and the supplements they offer for Ayurveda.  This combination helps immensely with balancing the body and digestive system...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it is holistic so takes some time for effect but after you are taking them with a healthy diet you start to realize how they are working in balancing the internal organs.  I highly recommend these products as they are well researched and only quality ingredients!

This helps me keep my digestion in check.  I take 3 at night before bed and wake up to comfortable regularity.

I‚Äôve tried other brands but this seems to work best as far as digestion goes, without any side effects or discomfort

I take this product every day for liver and kidneys cleansing. It‚Äôs natural, organic and works. I take the other supplements of this brand.

I have been taking 3-4 capsules after each meal for just under a year and have noticed a huge improvement in digestion capabilities and regularity and have not gotten sick all year since taking. I try to eat and live as Ayurvedic-ally as I can, though I'm not very strict. I love all of Banyans products and especially appreciate how convenient the capsules are compared with cooking and drinking in hot water, while still allowing you to taste the herbs before swallowing. I also have the powder and will take larger doses in the evening if I'm doing a cleanse or if I get a little sluggish.

I‚Äôve been taking this supplement for over two years now, and I believe it‚Äôs helped me maintain a healthy weight. I lost about 25 pounds the year before I began taking it, and have been managed to keep it off.  It certainly keeps me regular, even when my diet isn‚Äôt ideal. I have it on Subscribe & Save now so I don‚Äôt run out!

My good friend uses this for irregularities & it works like magic. Did the same when I recently had to have heavy iron supplements that cause issues. Love it.Highly Recommend

My functional medicine dr recommends these for digestion and constipation

I experienced easy cleansing, no abdominal pain!

Tri+phala= three fruits.  It is an old supplement that is widely used in Ayurveda.  This is a repeat purchase for us given the quality, we also buy other products from them.  The banyan botanical website is worth visting for more information on this and other supplements.  Well designed.

Since I've starting using Triphala my digestive system is getting back to a normal state of going to the bathroom at least twice a day as opposed to once every three or four days. I've also noticed that with exercise I have lost a lot of inches from my legs, arms and stomach. Wonderful product. I've also shown Triphala to my doctor, and she noticed that it didn't have any stimulants that would cause you to be addicted to this product which was great news to someone who doesn't like to take any medications what so ever.

I've been taking other Banyan Botanicals tablets for my specific dosha and they work great. I now want to detox and lose weight. I take 1 tablet at bedtime and wake up to go to the bathroom, so they do work overnight. I'll continue to take them and see about the weight loss. Ayurveda makes total sense and I feel great, have energy and a clear mind. I also do yoga and meditation. It is a life style and health concept that I really appreciate and believe in.

Before I started taking this herbal supplement, I was uncomfortably irregular. Now, I have no more bloating and am very regular. I feel so much better. When my doctor recommended them, I had my doubts, but I was desperate. But they truly do work.

I have been using this product for several months now as part of an ayurvedic regimen. It is good for health of the intestinal tract, and without getting into too much detail I can tell you that it does what it is supposed to do. I also like that this is an organic product grown and certified in the US. You have to worry about some of the herbs that come out of Asia, not that they are all bad, but it is harder to tell.

I take only one at night and it works great! Sometimes I purposely skip a night. It‚Äôs very gentle on the stomach . It has no taste that I notice. One and done.

I was VERY constipated and often had pain associated with diverticulosis.  I started taking two tablets of Banyal Triphala every morning 5 months ago. Since then i have bowel movements daily and no pain or swelling on the left side of my abdomen.

I am beyond shocked to receive the 12 fl after paying for 24 oz. I am returning it.

The only reason there is even one star is because I'm obligated to put it in in order to submit this. They deserve NO STARS!!! I have been using and loving this product for many, many years.  I ordered 2 bottles from Amazon that came from a company called PassApex. The product was unusually thick and I was concerned so I called Dr. Bronner's corporate office. It turned the product was old, and these people were not authorized to sell Dr. Bronner products!! When I tried to return it, there was a "no returns allowed" response. Fortunately, Amazon honored the return and they are refunding the full price I paid. Thank you, Amazon!

Sold as 24oz was only 12oz

This soap is terrible. I bought it back in December so that I could stop buying plastic containers and just buy in bulk and refill my glass container. I put it away in my pantry for a few months until I ran out of the soap a already had. It was a huge disappointment. I have normal skin, never very sensitive to products, but the first time I used it, it seemed to sting my skin. Also dried out my skin terribly. Only used once and then tried to return, Amazon would not accept the return because it was past the 30 day period(I did not realize it was only a 30 day window). I contacted the manufacturer and Dr. Bronzer would not stand behind its product either. The fact that it was over $40 with tax is ridiculous! So I now will just dump it all out and call it an expensive (for soap) lesson learned!

The item arrived and was bagged and the nozzle into the bottle was taped, but the pump was separate from the nozzle. I figured it came that way so that there wouldn't be any spills. I was wrong. I've wrestled with this for 7-10 minutes, trying to figure out how to put it on just to realize it's actually broken. It's hard to enjoy a product that I paid as much as I did, just to have it arrive damaged. Now I have to find or purchase my own bottle to put the product in. I also wasn't expecting the product to be so runny like an oil, I thought the consistency would be more like a thin sugar scrub consistency. Also the scent is not strong like I expected it.  I would not purchase this product again. There is also no replacement or return for a refund on this product.

Do not buy. Makes you very sticky! Going to throw out after a week of trying it. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I wanted a clean product but this isn‚Äôt for me!

The pump was already inserted and leaked all over. Seems used. Bottle was about 2/3 full. The liquid itself was separated. I‚Äôve useddr b‚Äôs products in the past and this was definitely sub par. Was supposed to be a gift and I would not even keep this for myself.

We have the Dr Bronners 18 in 1 lavender and use it for all kinds of things including body wash and or hair if needed on our boat - Gary water goes to Mother Nature.  Works wonderfully tho it does dry out my hair. This stuff is awful - bought it for our RV which has much less water pressure than the boat and this stuff will not rinse out of my hair - and my hair is fine and blonde. Cannot imagine what it is like in thick dark hair!

My hair felt like gum. I couldn‚Äôt comb through it. Rewashed twice and still couldn‚Äôt get it out of my hair. Tried it again using less soap and was still awful.

Unfortunately, I bought a soap hoping it will be without chemicals but if you put the soap next to my air quality sensor it will light up like a Christmas tree! This soap is full of VOCs

I ordered 24 oz I got a 12 oz with a broken pump. I tried to contact the seller - it doesn‚Äôt exist, tried to get a refund, it sends you on an endless loop and will tell you at the order you can return/replace but the endless loop does nothing. I reached out to Dr Bronners, they don‚Äôt endorse this seller and don‚Äôt refund. So needless to say, I won‚Äôt order again.

Product smells fantastic yet it leaves a very weird film on the skin, like my skin was stripped of all moisture and rough. First I tried it as a hand soap and my handles felt sticky afterward. Tried it as a body wash and still sticky. THEN I tried to set up a return and this is NON-RETURNABLE/NO REFUND available. For almost $13 for soap, this is BAD business. You‚Äôd think this product would be great since all Dr. Bronner‚Äôs products are yet this was lack luster. Too bad this scent wasn‚Äôt available in the castille soap line up!

Love Dr. bronner however this particular product seems to attract a lot of ants. I assume due to the sugar.

It smells and feels like I‚Äôm rubbing tree sap on my body. It leaves a sappy feeling on my skin when I‚Äôm done too. I used it on my hair and it felt like I washed my hair with glue. I had to wash my hair with shampoo three times to get it out. I DO NOT recommend

I love this soap and normally purchase at the TJ Maxx or HomeGoods near me where you can find a 24oz sometimes as low as $8. The product description here stated it was a 24oz bottle but I received a 12oz bottle. I can't get a refund even though the item is wrong. Seems like a scam and $15 is a ripoff for the amount. Don't buy from vendor 'Turn About'.

Scent is ok, not too strong and gender nuetral. Dr. Bronner's soaps give you a genuine squeaky clean feel. However, the seller VARSITY LINE PRODUCTS shipped me the incorrect size. I didn't realize it till after I put in soap dispensers and diluted. Perhaps a mistake or purposefully a scam. They made it very difficult to get credit back. I ordered a 24 oz. and received only a 12 oz. bottle. All they had to do, as I requested, was send me another 12 oz. bottle. Instead, I received phone calls from seller and they blamed Amazon and wanted me to call Amazon.

I love the product, but this seller charges for a 24 oz bottle but only sends a 12 oz. They also never responded when I reached out about why they sent the wrong size. Order the 12 oz from the the other sellers and don't pay this higher prices for less product.

I purchased the Lemongrass soap.  It smelled more like "Sweet Tea" to me, which was nice. The pump was attached to a large barrel inside, so lots of soap comes out, which is good...and unfortunately necessary.What really bothers me is the soap is so liquidy, and not viscous enough, so half of what I pump into my hand drips right off immediately, and goes right down the drain.  Also, this soap is the color of tea, a dark brown, which isn't appealing to me. There is a lot of oil in it, which when I used on my face caused me to break out (note).I'm sure it's a lovely company.

The seller taped the pump to the bottle with scotch tape which I thought was to prevent It from spilling the soap during transit. However, turned out It was just hiding the fact that the pump is broken and it‚Äôs missing a connector to attach the actual pump knob to the straw.Disappointed- I can‚Äôt even get a return and the bottle isn‚Äôt usable.

The pump top will not release no matter what I've tried - even using tools on it.The only way to use the soap is to pour it out of the bottle or use a separate soap dispenser.And Yes, I know how these kind of pumps are supposed to open - by gripping the dip tube and unscrewing the top.  That doesn't get this pump to release.The soap is not worth this aggravation.

I was really upset bc that after using this product I started to break out, and I researched all the ingredients and one of them is ‚Äúlye‚Äù which is what criminals in movies and tv shows use to break down bodies! Even tho the amount of lye in this so-called ‚Äúorganic‚Äù bar of soap is most likely very small, it is still highly toxic‚Ä¶and my body rejected it.

Did not like the soap. I found it does not lather well and I didn't think it cleaned very well.Also, I don't like reading the packaging of a product LIKE SOAP that tells you to love the Lord and washing away sins (or something like that.)While I can agree with that, I didn't think that was the appropriate place to put this.Threw the product away. Would not recommend.

I don‚Äôt even have sensitive skin but this dried my skin so bad.

Little to no lavender scent. I would usually purchase the lavender soap from Sprouts but due to the pandemic, decided to order online instead. Definitely not the same!!!! I purchased from Sprouts and could immediately smell and feel the difference after one use. Face clearer after one night. Thank goodness I was able order it online from for pickup! Won‚Äôt be purchasing again!

I subscribed to this soap and I‚Äôve been ordering it for months. My last order I received came in the lavender packaging, but the soap has absolutely no scent at all! I would like a refund but already opened the package.

I order the 6 pack and only got 2.??Aside from not getting what I ordered...the soap itself is amazing and smells so good and it‚Äôs the only soap I‚Äôll ever use again. Just not buying it from this seller

Love these bars of soap.  They are sold by the six pack ($27+) for six bars of soap.  Package came open, missing two bars.  Probably won‚Äôt reorder again.

Frustrating to buy a two pack and only receive one bar of soap‚Ä¶.

Strange, but I didn't like the soap when so many did.  Here's why:  I loved the lavender scent when the soap was dry, but when I wet the soap to use it, it didn't smell nice at all.  The lavender scent was completely  gone and was replaced by a sharp, sour scent.  Not good.  I let the soap dry, and voila! it smelled like lavender again.  Go figure.  Won't buy again.

I only received one bar this is nonsenseOnly got one bar when I ordered tw. I don't understand Amazon

I don't smell lavender when using this. The soap doesn't last very long. I won't be buying this product again.

Super drying! I have dry skin and my husband has oily skin and neither of us can use this soap! After just one shower with it it has dried out our skin so much! So disappointed, especially since we paid so much for it.

There is absolutely NO scent of lavender.  Fine as just another bar of soap.Lavender scent

I only received one bar of soap. The description states it was supposed to contain two.

So these soaps smell great. But after using them I have had itchy skin for weeks. I never ever get itchy skin, and literally hours after using these soaps I broke out in a rash.

Only received one bar!

Dr. Bronner's soap now contains Palm Oil. Shame on them. I wanted to buy it, but I can't.  Palm oil has been and continues to be a major driver of deforestation of some of the world's most biodiverse forests, destroying the habitat of already endangered species like the Orangutan, pygmy elephant and Sumatran rhino.

Smells good, but ends there - coming from a person who slays extremely dry skin, this soap dries Out my skin more than any soap I have used

It‚Äôs good for laundry but not for skin or hair

The smell of this soap is absolutely wonderful! It's a large bar and was really looking forward to it. Actually using it is fine but I have had such horrendous dry and itchy skin since using it. I wasn't sure that it was the soap so I stopped using it and my skin started to get better. I then used it again and had exactly the same problem. It's a shame because I ready the other reviews and had such high hopes for it. Apart from that, it smells great, big bar and great packaging - not a piece of plastic in sight which was wonderful.

Hade my hands very dry and sore

After reading most reviews and the ingredients list, I decided to buy it. Frankly, this wasn't a good purchase for me. Not very happy with it as it dries my skin. I though it would be a great moisturiser due to the numerous essential oils. However, I was wrong.

Despite all it's lovely other ingredients, this soap contains Palm Oil! A big no no if you care for the environment.

This Shope is very bed

$12-13 for one bar of soap is a rip off. I assumed it would be a pack of several bars. I believe I read in one of the comments that this was the case. I received one bar.

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Bronner's Lavender Castile Soap. This is, hands down, the best soap I've ever used. The lavender scent is pure bliss‚Äîcalming, soothing, and not at all overpowering. It‚Äôs like a little aromatherapy session every time you use it.What sets this soap apart is its versatility. Whether you‚Äôre using it in the shower, for handwashing, or even for household cleaning, it excels at everything. It leaves your skin feeling clean, soft, and refreshed, without any of the harsh chemicals or residues that other soaps have. A little goes a long way, too‚Äîjust a small amount creates a rich, luxurious lather.Knowing that it‚Äôs made with organic, fair-trade ingredients and is completely biodegradable gives me peace of mind that I‚Äôm using something that‚Äôs good for both my body and the planet. Dr. Bronner‚Äôs truly sets the standard for quality and ethical production.If you haven‚Äôt tried this soap yet, you‚Äôre seriously missing out. It‚Äôs a must-have in any home, and the lavender scent is absolutely divine. I‚Äôm officially a lifelong fan!

I love this soap. I have been having skin problems for a while now. I finally started a whole new regimen of soaking for 30-45 minutes in a tub of Epsom salt water. Then washing thoroughly with this new Castille soap. My skin is starting to show progress in healing a little at a time. This soap is great. It is more costly that regular store soap; and you don't want to leave it melting in a tub or dish. But I save it for those "special baths" that I have really come to look forward to!

The smell is so refreshing it made my whole bathroom smell so good! The soap is gentle on my skin and I don‚Äôt itch due to dryness from other soap.

This soap is much more affordable in the six-pack.  As a body bar, the lavender has a great fragrance and keep the skin from being dry.

Like so many people, we are trying to cut back on all of the chemicals in our daily life. If you‚Äôre here, you are probably in the same boat and looking for something that works, that you can trust. You hear about Dr. Bronners all the time, and even tho there is some discrepancy in a few ingredients, overall it‚Äôs still way better than most others! My husband is incredibly picky when it comes to soap and he said this was refreshing and moisturizing. It lathers up nicely and is versatile because we no longer need separate soaps for everyone in the family! The lavender scent is heavenly!!! We have been using this soap for a few months now and are extremely happy, although the cost is definitely higher than we typically spend. That being said, we decided to buy a cheaper option to save money, and didn‚Äôt like it, so back to Dr. Bronners we went!! Also, when you compare to other similar products, the price is equal to or cheaper. Overall, happy customers and will continue to purchase.

Price is good, i like the soap.

I like how it smells.  It cleans good but I wish the bars lasted longer

I love this soap! The scent, the feel and how long it lasts. It's much more expensive at the local organic market. I like being able to buy it in bulk, so I don't run out!!

Smells good haven't  had time to use.  Fast deliveryBars are smaller than I thought they  would be.

I mean it rubs the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again

This is ok but nothing compares to Irish Spring...which is cheaper and smells much better. Will not buy again .

This probably works for most people, but for me I‚Äôve noticed that this soap has a hard time getting me clean.

I read every label of every product I purchase, and it is difficult to find toiletries that aren't a toxic slew of chemicals. This soap is clean, but my goodness, it strips one's skin so dry, it hurts. I think it is also over priced. The scent is wonderful. I am glad they aren't using artificial fragrance to disrupt our hormonal balance.

I really wanted this soap to work, but it dried my skin out and got itchy. But you don‚Äôt have to smoke it or eat it. Just shower with it. And it‚Äôs made by hippies!

I would like to start by saying I Have used Dr bronners liquid castile soap for about 4 years now and decided to try the bar soap. This stuff is awesome it lathers up so good and leave my skin feeling clean and soft. Dr bronners soap has always got rid of my acne another reason why I love it so much.Update** March 2020The only problem I have with this product is it clogs my drain. The liquid soap does not do this to my shower.

Good value, but the product was too over-scented for me. Bars last  well.Put one bar in the trunk of my car because of the lavender smell.

When I opened the pkg the strong scent just about knocked me over, I gave the bars away.

Maybe their other soaps are not that harsh but I found this to be harsh on my skin. They are known for being organic, etc etc. so was not expecting that.

It washes well and smells great. Only downside is it has palm oil in it.

I would buy it again.

Though I loved the smell of this lavender soap, it made my skin itch every time I used it.  I like their peppermint soap much better.

Soap suds' well but lavender scent not as strong as I hoped for.  Also packaging should be more protective.  One bar was craved in on the corner when arrived.

I love the soap, but can buy each bar for $1.50 less at the local market.  Thanks, tho.

I don't like the bar soap nearly as much as the liquid.  And, the lavender scent was, well, nauseating -- may be just me.  Anyway, I'm going to try the peppermint bar just to be sure.  The bar is easier to use than the liquid for bathing, but I use the liquid for shampoo.  Don't not try it -- you may really like the scent.

I typically like lavender, but this one just had a smell that was not what I expected. It cleaned as well as any other Dr. Bronner product, I just didn't care for the scent. I gave it to a friend and she liked it very much.

The only thing I didn't like about this soap is it didn't last very long.  Would buy again if it stayed around longer.

Not buying more of this. Great lather and clean feeling but too pricey.

I love the way these smell and how clean I felt while using in the shower. Unfortunately, they clean a bit too well and seem to strip my skin of all natural oils so my skin ended up too dry to continue to use.  And yes, I use moisturizer right out of the shower, but still could not make this soap work for my dry skin, though I wanted it to work.

It's not bad but it's also not the best. Over the three weeks that I used it it dried out my skin worse than it was before. It cleaned decently though.

I have been wanting to use this product for a long time. After using it I can tell the difference between this and traditional soaps. My skin was soft, and not irritated. However, the smell is undesirable. It does not leave a smell on your skin, so it isn't a problem. I'm going to try the peppermint next to see if that smells better.

Nice smell... But not long lasting..

Bought two of these, one for myself and one as a wee gift for a new mum and baby. Horrified to discover it's smells terrible, nothing like actual lavender. Would not recommend

Nothing special. Very expensive

Great soap and great scent upon opening but this, unfortunately, disappearsupon first use.  Will not buy again.  Sorry.

This soap has been pretty consistent over the decades, and I like buying it in bulk.

Nice scent and worked well on my skin which is highly sensitive so that was a plus!

I really like the soap, and it lasts a long time. However, be careful, it's slippery due to the oil content.

I've used Dr. Bronnner's liquid soap since I was a kid, and my parents for a long time too.I always loved the lavender and peppermint ones.I had never tried the bar soap until this.It smells fantastic, I could smell it through the packaging in my mailbox.Unfortunately the smell didn't stick to me much, but I still love smelling it in the shower regardless.They are a bit more expensive at about $5 per bar, but they go a long way.Really the only thing I'm not crazy about is the way it leaves my skin feeling; super-frictiony.When I put my hand on my skin in the shower after washing the soap off, there was so much friction that I could not get my hand to glide on my skin at all, it was like I had spidermans hands.That goes away after a but, but then I was left feeling a bit dry.This may need complementary product to combat this issue, but it's a great product none the less.

Lather great. Smell great. Although 5 dollars a bar feels expensive. I keep buying them though.

It works well for my purposes of making laundry detergent.

This soap smells good, yet it doesn't have "too much" of a smell to where you smell like a flower all day.  It provides a good lather and it feels good on my skin.  My only beef is that the bar of soap seems to "melt" fairly quickly.  My first bar lasted maybe 3 or 4 weeks?  BTW:  I am a man who takes quick showers and I don't slather my whole body with soap.  Otherwise, it's a good product.  Will I buy it again?  Not sure, but I probably will.

I bought it for two reasons: I wanted a natural soap with no bad additives and I wanted a solution to my itchy dry skin. While I like it and will probably continue buying it, it didn't help my dry skin. So I started taking a fish oil supplement and that did the trick.

This soap creates lots of soap suds. I didn't understand the other complaints that it did not. Perhaps it is their water type. Anyway, this soap is very nice. My only complaint is that it leaves a thick layer of soap scum in the bathtub. Perhaps better to use in the shower.  High quality soap though.

I'm not sure if the soap has any kind of special properties, but it is a lovely soap, with a wonderful scent!

I love the smell!  I am using it also to make homemade laundry detergent but the nice smell doesn't tranfer to the clothes.  Makes nice lather.

Some may feel that the scent is to strong, but I love it.  After a while the scent dies down and is pleasantly comforting, to me. It's not abrasive on the skin and tends to penetrate and sooth areas on your feet, especially.

In my own small way, have stopped buying soaps that are NOT in plastic. So I've switched my body wash soap and Pure-Castile bar soap. It's a great body wash and the lavender fragrance is wonderful.

Love this soap. Smells great. It just runs out very quickly.

Smells great, bought this one and the peppermint, the lavender smelled beautiful while the peppermint was bad smelling.  Will buy this one again.  Works great, cleans great, only last about 4 or 5 days.

Nice scent! I've tried Yardley which i like a tad better -leaves a creamier lather than this Dr Bonner. I've tried Toms as well which had no lavender smell. My number one choice would have to be Yardley Lavender then this brand.

Love this stuff, but I wish it lasted longer. I go through a bar every ten days in the shower, which isn‚Äôt very cost effective compared to... well, all other bar soaps.

Nice scene, a little bit strong, but pleasant. Did feel a little dry after, but I have very dry skin.

Ok, not amazing. The solid castille soaps seem to burn a little for me, though this was much better than another brand. Just ok as a packable backpacking shampoo, which is I was testing it for. I think I'll stick to Dove for my soap.

Good soap I love it, cheaper at Walmart

The actual soap is fantastic, but this is how it arrived. No idea if it happened in transit, or at the seller's place of business.

It's a tiny bit strong on the skin. It leaves me slightly more dry than usual. I prefer the tea tree oil liquid soap. Other than that, satisfied.

I really like the feel of my skin after using this soap and the scent is pleasant. I will enjoy using this.

Suuuuuuuper drying, but smells lovely. I just personally can't use a soap this dry, but it really came in handy on my camping trip when I needed to clean off, it really cleanses, and I didn't have to worry too much about irritation to my skin with all the natural ingredients this soap contains.

Liked it

-bought as a gift --not knowledgeable about product qualities--except person who it is for likes it very much

very good smelled really good

Love the scents! I use these to make a healthier version of detergent!

My skin doesn't itch right it used to

This soap has a nice, true lavender scent. It is a little tougher to form a lather, but that's often the case with natural products. It's not my favorite, but I do like having it as a natural option.

Love this soap

Found out I react to this soap

I purchased this soap at another store and I was glad to see it online here but I only received one bar of soap instead of two. That is why I gave four stars.

I liked this better than I thought I would. It seemed like it kept my body odor in check longer than the conventional soaps I buy at the w store.

Love this Dr. Bronner's soap, I alternate this with the Tea Tree Oil one.  Can't really go wrong with this brand.  A bit pricey for soap, but it's organic and I love the company, too.

I have very sensitive skin and this soap is wonderful! I love the light smell of lavender that it leaves on my skin and it also makes my bathroom smell so wonderul.  I gave two bars to friends and now they use it. Great product!

Cleans my beauty blender fairly well. But not quite to the point I'd like it to.

The product was okay, but I did not use it for everything that it was good for. It was okay, but will not buy again.

It is the only soap I use because it doesn't dry my skin out.

Great soap. Awesome for homemade laundry detergent, also. Too pricey for me, however. Thanks but probably won't be buying again.

Nicely fragranced, good large size for a soap bar, and it is real soap.It is REAL SOAP, which some people find drying to their skin.Still gets you clean and leaves a light scent.

Great soap for whole family with no questionable ingredients.

Can use for almost anything, great smell, gentle on skin. I have brought for friends and family; they love it also.

Cleans well  smells good good product

Smells so good!!!!

good

love it

Good soap

Wonderful soap but not long lasting as triple milled vegan soaps.

Bought to use in my home made laundry detergent and it smells wonderful!

Love this soap. smells wonderful

Love this soap

Very good soap both gentle on skin and leaves a lean feeling

Rinses off and leaves you feeling and smelling clean.

I am an OG and really didn‚Äôt put any stock on soaps smells, I just wanted the job done and not have turn mushy, my wife bought these and now there are a must have, we have tried other lavander soaps ( feels kind of pricey but what do I know about soaps) but as far as smell and quality this is the best so far

Best bar soap on the market

Used for years and lasts a long time and cleans well and lasts. Love the subtle Lavender scent.  Tried all the other flavors and this is the one we stock up on.

Great quality with natural lavender scent

Love smell and soap

I will definitely buy this soap again, it‚Äôs smell so nice I feel very clean each day I used it

Love this soap.  It lathers up great and my skin feels so soft afterwards,

This is a great soap that I have reordered often. I am over 50 and had been having a lot of issues with soaps and my skin. It appears as we age, our skin is more dehydrated leading to various sensitivities (google search). I can no longer use hotel soaps for this reason. Too abrasive. This has been a solid choice both @ home and when I travel.

So far I‚Äôm liking this soap.  I put it in a soap bag and find that it lathers well.  I love the lavender smell and I haven‚Äôt found the soap drying like some reviewers stated.

The soap bar is a good size. The Lavender scent is pleasant and mild with a rich lather. The lather leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean. A Great Buy !

Since discovering this brand, nothing else compares! The clean ingredients leave my conscious clear, this soap really makes you feel clean, and bonus that the lavender smells amazing!

Great product. I'm always looking for natural products and have gone through a lot of different soaps finding ones that don't crack, or melt, or don't smell. This one is great. I highly recommend it.

Love this soap and the scent is amazing. I switched from liquid soap to bars of soap. This is great on my daughter's sensitive skin. My skin feels super soft and moisturized.

Great product

We grate this soap and add it to our laundry detergent.... So, the bulk order is perfect for us!

For Three years we have been using only this.Let me tell you it is a game changer for my family.So subscribe and  save.

We love to buy them in bulk as we use them for showers, baths and I also use them for laundry. I grate the bar soaps with washing soda to make my own laundry detergent.

Good

Awesome soap

I found a recipe to make my own laundry soap and it calls for Castille bar soap. I prefer the lavender scent. It is the perfect balance of scent, not too light, not too heavy. I can't tolerate overly scented anything and this product is perfect. When mixed wth the other items for laundry soap it doesn't even leave a scent on the clothes. They just come out smelling fresh.

This is my favorite soap!  I use it everyday to wash my face and body. If you are looking for moisturizing, this is not for you. I moisturize my face well after and in the winter, lotion is a must have, for this will leave your skin dry, which I personally like. I DO NOT like to feel ANYTHING on my palms. I often use CBD, castor oil and other ointments for pain relief & this is the ONLY soap that fully removes all oil from my hands after application. If you know anyone with sensitivity to products on their skin, use this soap and it will not leave even remnant of another product. Great if you have hyperhydrosis- wink wink. Girls with sweaty hands, this is your new friend. *I like most of the fragrances, but DO NOT use the peppermint if you are washing your face with it, it may burn your eyes. I prefer the lavender, rose and almond. My husband has oily skin and uses this on his face daily as well.

Great soap

Very good product.very happy with the quality.

This is the best soap. I‚Äôve ordered Dr. Bonner‚Äôs soap three times. The processing and shipping have always been timely.

This is the most moisturizing soap I've ever used.  And it is made of clean ingredients!

Smells nice and lathers well. Will be getting again.

When you find a soap is lovely this that something that feels so nice on your skin and is a healthy MADE product. You can‚Äôt go wrong. Dr. Bonners is famously known for these types of well-made products, healthy soaps leave your skin, soft and supple.

I like it for cleaning.

I great product that you know is EWG Certified and is healthy for you while using while smelling fantastic!

I have used Castile soap all my life. It is wonderful for your skin and is great to use on your hair also. It is a bit costly, but so worth the money!

I grate the bar and mix it to my homemade soap powders. My laundry is clean and has the best sent I could ever imagine.

I love this bar soap I shredded to make my own laundry soap works well fast shipping

My family and I have been using this bird soap to shower with for years. It is amazing and we don‚Äôt ever want to stop using it.

I bought this soap to shred in my homemade laundry detergent.  The fragrance is just lovely and seems to work well for my laundry soap.  I‚Äôll keep a bar for bathing as well.  One bar makes enough shreds to make two recipes of laundry soap.  I recommend.

this makes my eyes cry maybe i'm weak.

Good quality soap, rinses off easily which I really like.

I like this soap because of the natural ingredients, plus the great natural smell. The soap lasts longer than regular commercial soaps. Has a nice soapy foam & it feels nice on my skin. I like Dr Bronners peppermint soap as well.

I would absolutely give this a 5, and I absolutely LOVE this beautiful scent, but I only smell it while showering. No one tells me I smell good, and if the scent lasted longer, I would! Lol. Again, 5‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è in the way my skin feels‚Ä¶I‚Äôm very dry, and I don‚Äôt feel the need to immediately throw on moisturizer. It just seems to make my skin feel the way it should, lightly moisturized, and clean.Or- maybe come up with an almond light moisturizer for after shower? I would buy the heck out of that!

Good productive this in homemade laundry soap and for showering

I just love this soap‚Ä¶ the smell is not to strong and you always feel super clean after using.

Awesome soap, love the almond and citrus scents, gentle on skin, but also moisturizing. Highly recommend!

Love this soap‚Äî the almond smell isn‚Äôt super strong. Get the liquid soap for that.

We started ordering because it became easier to get and in bulk. So far we love ordering when it's need and always save from price in the store! The scent is light so if you don't like fragrance the almond is a good way to go. Just get a soap saver when in use.

I confess I bought this specifically because some unhinged person on TicToc decided it was Satanic. As a consumer, I sometimes try to do my part to offset damage done by the crazy out there. Turns out, it smells great, has a nice. lather and is gentle on my skin.

A new favorite in the house.  Even people that hate bar soap use it.

love this product!

This soap is harsh...not ph neutral.  Like many harsher soaps this bar soap actually strips your skin of its natural oils.  I‚Äôm a very active guy, shower a lot.  I ended up with a terrible rash/allergic reaction on my arms, neck area and my eyes from Dr Bronners.  It was so bad, I ended up at the dermatologist getting a cortisone injection and cortisone cream to knock it back down.  This is maybe great soap to scrub a floor, I don‚Äôt know.  But, I wouldn‚Äôt use it on my body EVER again.

These were counterfeit. Do not buy these from Amazon, they had no scent and were 100% fake.

Bought a couple of these soaps. At first the soaps smelled terrific, nice almond scent.  However, after a few weeks the scent was gone. I couldn't smell not even a hint of almond in the soap. I was very disappointed. Now it's just regular unscented soap. At least now, with the help of this comment, consumers are aware that they may not be getting what they paid for from this this vendor.

Only one bar of soap was received, this is not okay

Don‚Äôt be fooled like I was!!! It clearly says 12 pack In the add however I only received 6 bars

I paid 21 euros for 1 bar of soap. The visual clearly shows 2. This soap is great but disappointed that I only received 1 bar of soap.

Ordered this 2-pack of 140g soap bars. Received only one bar. Ordered replacement and you know what? Received one bar again so now have to do a return second time. Very disappointed.

The description says 2 pack but only got 1. Then I ordered again‚Ä¶and again only got one. So many similar reviews I don‚Äôt know why this isn‚Äôt fixed.

I submitted a return hoping the return would give me a 2 pack as the description say. Nope, still just one bar of soap.

Ordered a 2 pack (as described) but only received one bar. Ordered a refund/replacemnt and again only received one bar. Please do not charge me for the second bar!

Advertised as 2 bars and onlyReceived one. Very disappointed and won‚Äôt be buying again

I ordered a 2 pack of soap but I only received 1 pack.

Bought a 2 pack. Only received one bar instead of 2..

I ordered a 2 pack of this soap but only received one when my order arrived.

The product description clearly states "2-pack" of soap bars.  I only received one bar, inside a large padded envelope that could have fit ten bars.

Like others I only got one even though it says package oftwo.

i only got one soap

This does Not smell of almonds at all, it leaves skin very dry after using it, I even tried it on my thick hair as a shampoo, it was a nightmare, left my hair matted and the product did not come out, would never buy this again, just placed an order for the loccitane almond soap instead!

My skin disagrees with you Dr. Bronner. I really wanted to like this soap, but I don't.  I'm using it as hand soap and it leaves my hands VERY dry. Not just "regular" dry, but like "super rusty I need to put lotion on immediately" dry. I'm too nervous to use it in the shower. I do not want an ashy body. To top it off, the almond scent is so faint. It does a fine job of lathering and cleaning.  Ugh, I have 5 more bars to get through.  I won't purchase again.

i have used this soap for 2 years,i just hit reorder.To my surprise the cost skyrocketed! in 2016 i bought a 6pack for $25 and again in 2017 at same price,this time i got it.i realized is was almost $19 for 2 bars! This says it is a 2 pack and i thought i was ordering 2, 2 packs,that is the way it reads.I am pretty sure this is the way it came the last 2 times i ordered Great soap but not at over $9 a bar

I've been buying this soap for years, but I'm afraid this vendor's stock is so old that it completely lost any trace of it's scent.  I called the manufacturer (Dr. Bronner's) and they told me it must have been at least 2-3 years old to have no scent remaining.  Rather than hassle with the vendor, Dr. Bronner's was nice enough to send me a replacement.I've discovered that these are stocked at Whole Foods - perhaps it is better to buy them where you can see if they are fresh.

The item I received doesn't seem to be the same soap I purchase at the grocery store. The packaging is the same, but the scent is different.

Much too harsh.

Soap leaves a weird oil on you. Hard to get off.

Product may be good. Not my type.

Tried this on my hair but didn‚Äôt really work and had to revert back to normal shampoo. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. X

Came damaged (after having to wait for this to be re-delivered because the first package was marked delivered though it was missing)

I wanted to try Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Bar Soap after I heard so much hype. The scent was accurate and strong (which is fine for us). But its lifespan was way shorter than expected. At this price, I would rather buy local at farmers markets. That soap lasts a long time.

i was super enthused when i bought these and received them; they smelled delicious and the scent was quite strong which i like, especially with almond (i also bought the citrus ones and my review is the same). i was disappointed though because once wet, the scent almost entirely disappears and does not translate to the skin at all. i found that product to be very drying as well + my spouse and i go through each bar really fast with normal use. overall its a good product, but as a person with naturally dry skin i can't continue using it :/

It's odorless not what I was expecting because I bought the Almond scent.

This soap does the trick and is great for sensitive skin. However I notice that when you open a new soap bar it starts to lose its scent after you‚Äôve used it a bit. Too bad because the smell is so lovely at first!

It really cleans your body good but the citric acid can make you itch and dry your skin out afterwards

As soon as I got the Amazon tape cut, I could tell what was in the box. The fragrance lingers, too, especially if used as a body soap. Pricey for what it is, too, but I like the soap itself just fine.

Think I'll stick to the liquid instead.

After 18 days of use, I had to use another bar because 85% of it was gone and the rest falls apart.  I used this soap for about 1 1/2 years and then noticed my skin was becoming increasingly drier.  I used it on my face for a shorter amount of time because it was very drying and I was starting to look older than my age! The almond scent is great but I found it to be very drying on my skin.

Compared to the body wash, it‚Äôs not that great. I used it and it wasn‚Äôt as strong but it works

Not as fragrant as the lavender one but still a good soap

The product itself is nice but I didn‚Äôt notice and moisturizing

Great soap, feels just like regular soap. And herein lies the problem. It's 5 times the price of regular soap.I'll update this review if I feel anything better or if family tells me their skin feels better after using these vs our regular soap bars around the house.

I like this soap a lot. I just don't smell much almond on it. Maybe that's good, it means there is not synthetic or otherwise undesirable chemicals in it. But I did kind of hope I'd be hit with wafts of almond smell when I washed with it.  I smell it, it's just so faint.

I have no real complaint of the soap since I never used it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine but the smell isn‚Äôt my thing.

Feels good on the skin, the fragrance is a coating on the outside the whole bar doesn't smell like almond.

It's pretty average as far as decent soap goes. I really have been comparing it to the Nubian Heritage soaps which are similarly priced and in my opinion are much better.

But NOT better than peppermint one

Soap is great but not sure why they push a all-one-God on their products.

I really love the smell of almond. I smelled it really good before I used it, but when I did use it, I didn't really smell the almond too much. It didn't really stay soapy. However, when I rinsed all I did feel very clean.

little too expensive!!

This is a great organic soap however it doesn't last very long for the price...it will leave you squeaky clean..but it dried out my skin...I need something a little more moisturizing.

ok

Body wash only

soap is good

My skin turned very dry after using this soap.  Is that common?

I started using Dr. Bronzer‚Äôs during college because it was so much cheaper than buying several different products. The liquid Castile soap you could use as a shampoo, body wash, hand soap at the sink, overall degreaser‚Ä¶we used it in the kitchen, around the stove and to clean the bathroom. And we would dilute it so a little went a long way. I believe a full bottle back then was about $7.50 (it‚Äôs now about $14)So I tried the bar soap‚Ä¶not impressed at all. Seemed to dry out my skin, I can‚Äôt imagine using this on my hair. Certainly can‚Äôt use it for much else than hand and body so it‚Äôs not versatile like the liquid soap.And the price! My bar lasted me for about 2 weeks of daily use and then when it got small, it broke apart into pieces too small to use.At full price, this is about a $6.50 bar of soap that will last 2 weeks of daily use.Dr. Bronner‚Äôs went from being the cheap alternative organic multi-use to severely overpriced hipster soap. Fortunately you can get a generic version of the liquid Castile soap for about $9.00 at Meijer that smells similar and works just as well. That bottle will last you for 5 months and it‚Äôll work al through the house. Do the math.

The pics with 6 bars is confusing.  It makes us believe we will be getting 6 bars. Although note that dropdown to select how may you want is clearly shows 1( Not sure if  I am allowed to make a comment like this on Amazon my last review on cost wasnt accepted)

Bought to take on holiday instead of liquid shampoo. Like other reviewers pointed out, it might be a matter of water quality, I found it left my hair dry and unmanageable and with a greasy residue. It's ok as a soap, even on the face, expensive though.

I LOVE the smell and it seems to clean well. My only complaint is that it leaves some sort of film on my hands after rinsing. It's not a bad trade off for not having any toxic chemicals though. I will probably try the liquid version of this soap as well.

Smells great and feels good too....melts a bit quick.

I like the soap enough but it was nothing to brag about.

Love it but it goes so fast. Smells like heaven and so gentle on my extremely sensitive skin

These soaps are great. I've also tried the lavander scent but prefered this one better. The scent might seem a bit strong at first and I garantee you'll feel fresh all over your body. I have atopic skin and using this soap instead of the soaps sold in supermarkets made a big difference.

Smelled good. Did soap things well.

Love the scent (Almond), it's better than regular soap, but I did notice it does not help my dry skin as well as some other "organic" soaps.  But I still love the scent!

Good soap. Noce smell. Small bar

Smells nice. Almond scent isn‚Äôt over powering or smell perfumy. It‚Äôs very soapy though. Finished faster than I‚Äôd like. Hasn‚Äôt dried out my skin. Ordered this soap twice already.

everyday shower soap

Smells good. Seems to get the skin really clean. I'm pleased with this natural soap and will continue to purchase it. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin.

It's soap. I wasn't using this to cure any ailments or necessarily solve a problem but rather just support an interesting company. Let's see....it smells good, is appropriately sudsy, and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry. Essentially everything you'd want from a soap.

I like the almond.

Lasts about 14 daysI wish it would last longer.

pretty nice soap, but if you don't cure these they disappear fast.

This is a nice soap. All natural, long-lasting, effective product. It smells nice, although very faint. I was hoping for a slightly more potent aroma, but all in all am happy with this product. Might try a different type of Dr. Bronner's next time, just to see if they smell any stronger!

Great soap

The quality of the soap is great. It is pure. It smells great.The downside is that it is so expensive! It is about $4 per bar when it is on sale!!! I am not sure what to do because I am allergic to so many things.

A little pricey, but wanted it for my son's sensitive skin, and it smells so good, and it worked.  Will buy again in the future.

I try to buy in bulk to pay less. This is the only soap my family uses, but the bar goes fast and is a bit pricy for how long it lasts. We go through 1 bar in about 2.5 weeks.

Used this to make laundry soap. Smells great and works good.

I like the bar version of castile soap, they seem to lather more than the liquid. Although the liquid ones definitely have a stronger smell.

smells just like sweet almond scent

Love these soaps but my husband does complain a bit about dryness of his skin.

good soap

Been using this brand for many years.  Good consistent soap.

great for hand washing but had trouble in summer with all over body wash not bad in winter

Scent is minty. I don't like it. Nice otherwise

This soap smells incredible and feels awesome on your skin! It‚Äôs a bit pricey but worth it. I have sensitive skin and this soap does not irritate it at all.

Useful,

I‚Äôve  been using Dr. Bronner‚Äôs soap for years. I usually get the lavender but it was sold out so I got the almond. I love the mild scent.

I like the product and buy it frequently. Amazon makes it easy to buy the soaps

I use this soap for everything. Right now, I have this as a hand soap in my bathroom, but it lasts a long time and feels good in the hands. Love the company and their values.

I will buy this again

Very mild smell, cleans well, last a long time, no weird minty tingle. Only complaint (which applies to all natural soaps) is they build up soap scum in the tub/shower really quickly. Easy to clean off though.

My whole family loves this soap.  Almond is our favorite but all the scents are so good.  It lasts about 10-14 days on average per bar.  We feel that is a good value.  I highly recommend it.

Hi early the best scented soap have been using it for years now always have to make sure I keep it in stock. Makes my body super soft and clean. Love the convenience of buying in bulk through Amazon.

This soap is fantastic. It smells great and I use it in the shower on my body. I use the liquid soap on my hands at the bathroom sink or I'd use a bar there too. I've purchased a box of blue peppermint ones too and I alternate.

Do you want to feel relaxed, take a bath with a soap without unwanted chemicals, wonderful almond scented with natural olive oil  _Then Dr Bronzer's All-one hemp almond pure Castile bar soap is for you :)

I literally have to stop myself from MOANING every time I smell this stuff. It smells SO good and has me feeling clean and baby fresh when I leave the shower.

I honestly don't know how I ever cleaned anything before finding this soap. I use it for everything...everything. I could list so many things but I think I will just give a couple of ideas people might find helpful. This is great for people who have REALLY dirty jobs or greasy jobs. A friend of mine is a mechanic and I convinced him to try this because his hands were always black with dirt even when they were "clean." He was shocked that his hands could actually be CLEAN clean.I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works magically. If you used cream or liquid products and left them to sit for a bit, it would help to use a little bit of oil (olive or sweet almond oil are my recommendations) to break it down a bit before using soap. Follow up with a silicone free conditioner for your natural hair brushes to keep them properly conditioned because they are hair after all.I also highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with skin & heat rashes under skin folds or bra areas but use the unscented version. I work with unhoused and elderly people who struggle with this and medicine is not always covered by insurance. I'm not recommending forgoing medicine when prescribed, but this soap may be a great option as prevention and to heal the skin as well. Just make sure you dry the skin very well and apply something like Aquaphor as a skin barrier after.

This soap is everything!  And no harmful chemicals.  I love it, it's not cheap, so when I can find it for less than $5 a bar, I stock up and you should too.  Try it.

Lathers well, squeaky clean, great smell. Love it!

Almond soap smells great and keeps me moisturized.

I absolutely love this soap as it‚Äôs so gentle for my sensitive skin. My husband used a traditional brand of soap for years that was full of chemicals and fake scent. Now he uses this and can never go back to what he was using before.

Almond scent really comes through but is not overwhelming.

I love the fragrance! I do like a larger bar though.

Great soap with natural ingredients.

Absolutely in love with the almond oil soap here. I think sometimes about eating it. THAT SMELL! Satisfying and perfect for the shower.

Dr Bronners soap is expensive and hard to find, so if you find it buy it.  It is worth the price and quality.

I've been switching soaps frequently, possibly part of a mid life crisis, but in any case I love this soap, especially in hemp almond.  I used the liquid Bronners for a while, but was always too lazy to dilute according to instructions for use on the skin and found it too watery and too strong.  The bar soap version however, has the perfect amount of moisturizing to leave my skin feeling clean and soft without that greasy moisturizing soap feeling.  The scent is light and smells great while you shower, but fades away quickly.  It lathers easily, rinses easily, and is overall exceptionally pleasant and luxurious.

I use all of the different scents they carry but this is my favorite one, super soft and clean smelling

This is a wonderful soap with clean ingredients, and it's our favorite scent!

I love the quality of these soaps, I used them for bathing and to make my laundry detergent. Wish it was a little cheaper but it's all natural and good quality üëåüèæ

This is my family's go to soap. We can count on it not irritating our skin.

Everybody forgets your skin is an organ as well we just wear it on the outside. This is a great soap with great ingredients. I've been purchasing this soap for quite some time now. You also notice that there's a lot less soap scum in your shower. That alone should say something.

My favorite scent

Try them, you will like them too.  I started buying Dr. Bronner products in the 1960's.

We love Dr. Bronner's soap. Great product. Great price. Would highly recommend.

A little expensive, but gets me clean with no leftover residue and a great scent

Very soapy

Its a little pricey but it is all natural and non irritating. Lathers and makes me feel clean. We use either orange or almond

I heard about this soap from a story of an NYPD Cop who used this Hemp base soap and tested positive for drugs.That is not why I purchased, Hemp & Almond Soap in this brand is hard to find here in MO. Absolutely the best lathering soap I have used to contain pure ingredients. I have used other scents from this maker, however, this is my hands-down favorite. I gave a bar to my buddy, and he loves it too!!

Love this naturally scented (no fragrance) almond soap but this scent is difficult to find in stores. Ordered a twelve pack and very happy to have  good supply.

All natural! No obnoxious fragrances! Doesn't dry out your skin! Cleans surprisingly better than most other soaps, and I'm mean for blue collar stuff like automotive grime. Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things. I hope this review helps sell a lot of soap. Enough to get my local grocer to carry it ;) Maybe even enough to drive the price down a little. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. PS I use this on my hair as well ;)

Received as promised, very happy with the delivery and product is in great condition.  Absolutely love this soap!  And having a hard time finding it in the grocery stores at this time.

Non toxic. All green EWG rating. If you doubt that chemicals and toxins attach to your cells and cause health issues, you would be mistaken. I had a neuro lipid IGL test after having significant health issues and found chemicals in common products attached to my mitochondria/cells. I now use Suzanne Somers organic cosmetics and go to an organic hair salon. The test revealed quite a bit of info, but seeing chemicals in normal everyday soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, and hair dye attached to my cells was unexpected. I use EWG to rate products and I steer clear of all products that have unnecessary chemicals. As I attempt to improve my health, I share the same attitude when it comes to going to the grocery store; all organic, nothing processed and as clean as possible. Anything else is a chemical crap storm and if I were not on Amazon, I would swear instead of saying ‚Äúcrap.‚Äù

We've been using Dr Bronner's soaps for years now and just love them all. Our favorites are this almond scent and the orange scent. We use the bars and the liquid. They are all fantastic. If I had to find something negative to say, it would be that during the dry winter season, the liquid soaps can be drying to your skin. We add avocado oil to the hand soap dispensers to help with that issue. We use the liquid soaps in foaming dispensers and they foam great. Just add a few drops of your favorite oil to it to help with the drying effects during the winters. Since the oil will simply sit on top of the liquid in the dispenser, we give it a shake before each use to make sure that the oil is in every squirt. Thanks Dr Bronner's for great products and your love for planet Earth and being good stewards of it all.

My go to bar soap!  Smells great and sensitive to the skin.

I have very sensitive skin and this soap does not irritate it.

I have very sensitive skin and have been using this soap for several years. These 6 bars will last a long time.

I really like masculine scented soaps and since this one rated so highly on Amazon, I bought the pack of 6.  What a disappointment!  I mean as far as soap is concerned, this does the job -- but it has no detectable scent.  It's not fully unscented, but whatever scent it does have is hardly noticeable.

Generally I use the tea tree soaps from Dr Bronner however I wanted to try something new. I am not convinced that this is a scent I will buy in the future. The lavender scent is odd...not quite like lavender and not very strong.Overall okay as there is no skin irritation but don't love the scent.

This soap is nice and mild, lathers and cleans well, rinses clean.Also doesn't dry out my hands too much (like other can do)I have very sensitive skin and blister with most antibacterial soaps.Thought I'd give these a try.Basically I have no complaints .. except for one (the Lavender smell is awful)I realize it's a natural lavender oil smell, but for me it's terrible.My wife says it makes her nose itch?I keep hoping the smell from the bar goes away over time (and it does seem to diminish over time)But, next time, I'll go with the scent free.

I've used Dr. Bronner's liquid soap for a lot of things in the past, I've never really used the bar soap. While I'm all for the organic, natural care products, bronner's bar soap didn't hold up to the test. The bar disintegrated super fast and went through a bar almost every week compared to it's competitors of other types of natural soaps which lasted at least 2-3 weeks tops for two people. Not sure if the other scents fall apart just as fast, but I went back to my old soap after I went through my order.

Have been using Dr. Bronners for many years but this order did not seem like pure Castile soap. The skin feels so dry and itchy. Not happy at all.

The product used to be 5 stars before gmo corn based citric acid was added now it just makes corn allergic people like myself itchy.

The soap is very nice.  The lavender scent is awful. I keep hoping that the chemical smell will go away.

lathers great...smells good

great for making soaps

I am a teacher and I wash my hands all day- they were so dry and itchy- I had given up!  I got this stuff and plan on buying the liquid, it smells great, lathers great, and best of all doesn't dry out my hands.  It doesn't really add moisture- but my hands feel so much better because they are not stripped of everything like the anti-bacterial soaps do- Everyone should switch- I am going to get them for all my friends and family- good price on here too!Later note- I did go get this in the liquid form and put it in my bathrooms and kitchen.  It seems to leave an odd film in my sinks- both the stainless steel and the porcelin sink in my bathroom.  It drove me nuts b/c it made the sinks look dirty.  Once I ran out I didn't buy anymore-I wished it didn't do this b/c other than that I liked it!

Negative:I have two complaints. The soap doesn't lather up as well as Dr. Bronners liquid soap. In turn, it's not as easy to wash off your skin leaving a slight residue unless thoroughly rinsed. My second complaint is how harsh it is on sensitive skin. The soap is extremely basic which strips the skin of your natural oils. If you get it in your eyes it will really burn. I prefer a more neutral soap.Positive:Packaging is a plus printed with 100% water based ink and definitely support fair trade! Some people were complaining that it doesn't smell like lavender, my opinion is it smells just like it.Conlusion:Dr. Bronner's company started it all. In an array of chemicals in the 20th century they were the gleam of hope. Today their are many other options but will always support this company.

I LOVE this soap! The product itself gets 5/5 stars- however as for the price, no. I can get a bar of this at rite aid for 4.99, meanwhile per bar this comes out to roughly 6.33 each. Pass

I don't know what is the hype. I love Dr. bornner's product in general but not this one. The smell does not like lavender. It has a weird smell that I don't like.

This soap is alright. Larger bars than most..

But too expensive

Smells really great. Added to laundry soap I make, instead of FelsNaptha.  Does really great in my front loader because I can shred it smaller than other bars. And it dissolves cleanly.

This seems to work for the household since we have issues with fragrances. My only down to this would be after a couple of weeks the soap starts to get really soft.

This product feels nice on my skin, the sent is pleasant and I believe most of the ingredients are organic.

After hours of researching, I chose this natural soap.  Smells great!  Lathers quite well in our moderately hard water.  I took one star off because like most soaps, it leaves a dry, white film behind on everything -- skin, shower doors, shower lining/tub.  Because of this, will not be buying again, as it increased time needed to clean shower and increases use of skin lotion.  Have gone back to using Dove for sensitive skin (decent rating on ewg.com for health and environmental concerns).  Dove does not leave any film, and that's important to us.  Now I need to find a natural soap that behaves like Dove (lathers very well, leaves skin moisturized, and doesn't leave film on everything).  If you're reading this and no of such a soap, please reply here with a comment.

I grate this soap and use it in homemade laundry soap.  The DIY laundry soap works great and this soap in it makes my laundry room smell delicious.  Fels Naptha probably works better, but this smells so good!  Some people recommend it for skin.  I can't, but I can't use any bar soaps.  I find this to be both drying and irritating.  For household preparations, though, nothing beats it.

This is the second time I have purchased this soap and my husband and I really enjoy it for the simple fact that it's natural and organic. Plus, lavender is on of my favorite scents! At our local grocery store, it's only $3.99 per bar so it is a bit cheaper - that's why I dropped it down to 4 stars. I'm assuming it's a bit more due to the fulfilling/shipping aspect.

I used this in a recipe for homemade detergent. It has a natural lavender smell...not flowery like fake lavender scents that give me a headache. It's almost a piney scent which some people might not like but I like it and it's not over powering. It seems to work well for my laundry as well.

I use the soap to clean myself and smell nice.

I buy this soap because it is natural, you can use it for your hair and body and it lasts longer than bodywash. My only issue with it is that it seems to be a bit drying so you have to make sure to lubricate your body afterwards to avoid the ash attack.

Loved

The soap gets a bit mushy. I go through one of these quickly compared to other soaps but I dig the ingredients.

I love this soap. The smell is great and I can still smell it on me long after I've showered.

I really like the soap, it leaves my skin smooth, not dried out. I will get the unscented next time but he lavender, and the peppermint, both leave the bathroom smelling great!

It's not melted in the water as you can read in other review. So it last long compared to other product. I like it.But it doesn't help my husband acne skin at all which was a main reason I bought.Overally I like it.

Smell is perfect, and skin feels so soft after use.  It's a keeper for sure!  It's helped my young daughter's dry skin patches immensely.

Nice soap and less chemicals

I was making laundry detergent and decided to use this as the bar soap. Its very fragrant and calming. It seems to be doing a good job.

Great soap with good lather and a calming fragrance. I always buy it as a treat for family members.

Excellent.

Great for washing dirty balls

Like the fresh scent ! I use it to make homemade laundry soap. Easy to grate up and dissolves fast!

Smells nice

works

Great soaps!

Great soap!!! All I use now.

good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.

good

Works ok

I do like this soap! Gentle on my skin. I feel really clean after shower & yet my skin still has moisture to it. But  I still use my lotion. The bar lasts longer than regular soap cause the smallest amount makes A LOT of lather! And doesn't leave behind soap scum. Yes! Although this is a bit pricey. I've decided to stop using regular soap. This is sooo much better. I just didn't like this lavender scent. I thought I was getting the more milder scent of lavender & not this earthy-like smell. Was very disappointed. But after a couple of showers I was able to tolerate it & luckily it's not so strong that it conflicts with my body lotion. Aside from that, I'd recommend this soap to any & everyone, especially those with skin issues.Oh, it did burn down in my area with the very first use. But after that no more.

Great product but lathers a lot and can use it up quickly.

I love this brand of soap but I‚Äôm taking off one star because my husband and I both find the scent to be a bit overwhelming.

I've been using Dr. Bronner's Lavender Castile Bar Soap for a few months now, and it has become a staple in my skincare routine. The first thing that drew me in was the scent‚Äîit's a natural, soothing lavender fragrance that isn‚Äôt overpowering but still leaves a pleasant, calming aroma in the bathroom.The soap lathers beautifully, even with just a little water, and it leaves my skin feeling incredibly clean without any residue. What I appreciate most is that it doesn‚Äôt strip my skin of moisture like some other bar soaps. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished, thanks to the organic oils in the formula.Another plus is the soap's versatility. I've used it not only as a body wash but also for washing my face and even cleaning makeup brushes. It‚Äôs gentle yet effective, which is a rare find in a bar soap.I also love that Dr. Bronner's is committed to using organic, fair trade ingredients, and that their packaging is environmentally friendly. It feels good to use a product that aligns with my values.Overall, I highly recommend this soap to anyone looking for a natural, multi-purpose product that smells amazing and takes great care of your skin.

Added comment on 4/19/16 - still my favorite soap.  Have bought a years'+ supply.  :-)Additional comment added on 8/29/12 - My wife pointed out that since I started using this harder soap, she has to occasionally treat the drain pipe with Liquid Plumber.  (she's very handy with knowing lots of stuff - I'd be lost without her)... anyway, she said that with the Irish Spring, she never had to do that.  It appears the harder soap is congealing in the trap after the hot water has flushed the tub down after the shower, and it's leaving a layer of scum that attaches to the trap as the last of the water cools down.  It's not a show-stopper, but it's something I thought I should add to the review.  I do remember this was a problem in my parents house too, as all soap was much harder back in those days.Original review starts here:I've been looking for a while for "all natural" ingredient soaps, and I have bought several to try out.  However, when getting one bar at a time, of a product that chain stores just don't carry (at least in my area), the prices tends to be rather high.  Anyway, I hit on this one, and I really love it.  The scent is pleasant, but not overpowering.  It cleans really well, and most importantly, my skin has improved since using it.  Interestingly, the bars last a lot longer than the commercial soap I used to buy (Irish Spring).  I don't think this is completely due to size, but also to the "hardness" of the bar.  It lathers very well, but we do have a good water softener, so that does make for good lathering.This soap is so good, I can wash my hair with it, and it feels just as good as using a good natural shampoo.

I have used this soap for a few years now. You may find it a little pricey but it is all I use now. I use for bath and use to wash my hair. I don‚Äôt buy shampoos/condtioners anymore, so I do save money there. I do however use leave in conditioner type products, on my hair but I would use those products anyway. These are large bars and last longer than regular bar soaps, in my opinion.

This is my first time trying Dr. Bronner's soap. I was looking for a cruelty free soap that would be gentle on skin and get the job done. I love the soap; it's not harsh and cleans very well. The sustainability features are important to me. I love the lavender scent and want to try the other scents as well. Will definitely be a repeat customer.

You very clean, refresh, and the lavender scent brings calmness to you.

Lathers very well and lasts

Smells good and lathers well

preventing major illness is a busy job for us health-nuts, but worth every molecule of energy.  this bar soap is as pure as possible, which means that when i wash my face, hair, and body with it, i can feel confident that i am safeguarding my wellness.  and because there is no plastic packaging, the planet is better off too.  win-win, if you ask me.

Great Soap!

I feel relaxed and refreshed when ai use this soap. I love the calming scent.

Great

I purchased this soap to make my own laundry detergent. It smells amazing! Light and fresh. Not a harsh lavender by any means.

Pretty much love everything about this soap other then it doesn‚Äôt last very long.

I love Bronner‚Äôs bar soap.  Used to buy rose ones but switched to lavender this time.  Unexpectedly real essential oil smell and feels great after shower!  Will definitely buy again!

I purchased this soap to shred into my homemade laundry detergent. It smells really great and it helps wash my clothes. Highly recommend.

LOVE IT!

Great product

I have been using this soap for years and I like the way it feels and cleans. I have tried many of their fragrances and they are all nice, but lavender is my favorite.

Out of all the scents this one is the strongest. I use it to make my own laundry detergent. And it's amazing, all my neighbors can smell when I'm drying my clothes. Nothing but good things, also bugs can't stand lavender so it's created a niece boundary for my home too.

my lady loves the smell of me when I wash with this soap

Best soap I've ever used.  I started buying this about 15 years ago when Bronner himself was still running the company and he only marketed by word-of-mouth and didn't deal with chains, along with all the religious preaching that came with it.  I read about the soap in some offbeat magazine my uncle had a subscription to and I liked what I heard.  Apparently supermodels were using it, so maybe it would work for me.  Before finding this, I went through a lot of different mainstream soaps and my skin would always be itchy, especially in the winter.  I remember feeling like a bear in the woods trying to get at the itches on my back with a door jamb shimmy dance I would do.When I started using this (first the liquid, now this bar soap which I prefer), within weeks my itching was cured.  Something they put in most soaps doesn't agree with my skin, and this stuff doesn't have it.  Somehow it cleans the skin without stripping the natural oils.  I've tried other castille soaps that have come on the market since, but they're sub-par based on consistency and smell as well as on how my skin feels.  Those still are superior to the mainstream soaps, but Bronner's is still king in my book.Something of note, in the hopes that someone of import at the company reads this review, is that the marketing has changed significantly since the old man passed away.  It was kind of a quirky thing with all of the "all-one" preaching on the packaging, but I really miss reading it sometimes.  I also noticed that I started seeing it at not just chains like Whole Foods and Henry's, but at places like major supermarket chains and the like.  That's all fine and dandy, but please, please, please, I beg of you, don't change a thing about how the soap is made.  There's something almost magical about this formula.  Simple it may be, but changing anything with the soap itself would be a disservice to Bronner's memory in my opinion, and to your loyal customers.

I love having one item and I can wash my hair and the rest of my body.I also love the packaging. No bottles in our landfill

These soaps smell really nice, and keep my skin clear. They also last a long time.

It works well for using in my laundry detergent and smells good too!

Love this soap!!!

I've used their soap before but I just got into making my own laundry detergent so that was the purpose for the purchase, and honestly it's a great bang for your buck! Love the smell and the detergent is a win - way cheaper, no toxic chemicals, and my clothes still look and smell clean!

Just really like the fragrance and how clean you feel.

I bought these to make my own powdered laundry soap.  These smell great and I was able to grind them up well by cutting them up and then putting them in my blender.

I have very sensitive skin and this soap works wonders for me. It smells amazing and leaves me feeling very clean without drying my skin out. I have tried many different natural soaps but this is my favorite. I also, appreciate that this comes with a lot of bars of soap making it cheaper than going to the store where you can only get one bar at a time.

UPDATED - I previously ordered 2 bars of this soap in the lavender fragrance to give as gifts for my cousins who have sensitive skin... Opened the package and immediately knew I needed to order more for my husband and I! These smell so amazingly good and super fresh!! If you like lavender, you'll love this!Paraben free is a must in our household with cancer on both sides of the family. Dr. Bronner's is a good brand we know we can trust, without the preservatives found in breast tumors. These bars are larger than other natural brand soaps we've purchased and last nicely.Last year my cousin's and their parents fought over their soaps, lol. We all have sensitive skin but my cousins use this for deodorant and shaving cream because they're allergic to almost anything else. So this year I went for this six pack, which worked out to be a better value anyway.My shipping info said they'd take over a week but Prime had them shipped to me in two days and in time for Christmas. These smell so intoxicatingly good, even though they're individually wrapped, everyone could smell them through the wrapping paper (I used over the soap wrappers). Again, they were a hit! Smile. Buy with confidence.Christmas 2016 - Another 6-pack to go with gifts and the quality is the same. You can smell them through the delivery box. Awesome soap, gentle but a real treat. Uploading a photo so you can get a closer look. I didn't bother wrapping them this year because everyone knows what they are before they pick them up anyway. Smile. Hope this helps.

I have used Castile soap for years! It is easy on your skin and moisturizes it. You can wash your hair with it also!!

So well milled, nice scent and always a strong lather.

I love the soap and the environmental rating that it get.

The lavender scent that lingers on‚Ä¶

Absolutely love this.  I use it for making my laundry powder,  for bathing and with my homemade shampoo.  I've tried other castile soaps but this brand is the tops. It smells great too

I love all of the Castile soaps. Best soap out there.

This has become my favorite soap!! It smells really good and cleans very well!!

I prefer citrus smell!

I use nearly all of Bronner's soaps - never disappointed. Rich lather. Fragrant aromas.

I have both the lavender and orange scents of these Dr. Bronner's soap, and both are lovely scents while also being light in scent. My cupboard smells wonderful without being overpowering!  This soap cleans well and I really appreciate how long each bar lasts. This soap is not "creamy" and does not produce as much lather as more conventional soaps but that is part of the value and environmentally friendly aspect of this soap. I find that the creamy soaps  "dissolve" and are wasted just sitting there in the soap dish or shower. You must rub this  our turn it around in your hand to get the  Dr. Bronner's soap on your hands. But I feel that they are worth it for the naturalness, the scent and the long-lasting nature of them, definitely cheaper that a bottle of body wash that is mostly water, plastic and chemicals.

This is a set of six individually wrapped bars. Dr Bronners is a natural soap that‚Äôs good for your skin, smells great & lathers well. It‚Äôs our family‚Äôs favorite.

This soap is fresh smelling and kind to skin and especially lasts for a long time.

While expensive, this soap is great and lasts a very long time considering its size.

Love the fragrance, long lasting, environmentally friendly!!

I love the smell !!

Love this soap and buying it in bulk saves me money!

I have used this soap for years ! I love it!

This natural soup is my favorite. It makes my skin tinkle and smells great.

It cleans well and has a pleasant scent.

Love this lavendar castile soao

I should have looked at the size before purchasing this product. Because the asking price is $13.95, I just assumed it would be the perfect size. I purchased the same product, from my local store for $9 the size was 16oz. This product is too expensive for only 8oz of soap.

My fault for not checking the size but this is a really bad deal. You can get a 32 oz size (as opposed to this 8 oz size for ) for $16

I have been using this soap for years and I have never experienced this issue until recently. On the left is the first bottle that I ordered, it is really dark and has nearly no smell of peppermint whatsoever. I decided to return it and purchase another one while I wait for my refund. I got the second bottle and same issue. It‚Äôs super dark and has nearly no peppermint smell.

Too small for the price. A couple more dollars and I could have gotten the full sized bottle üòî

Read the full description. These are tiny bottles about 1/4 of the normal size. I could get a normal sized bottle for the same price elsewhere

This product is watered down. I have purchased directly from the them and it was night and day

The bottle is very small. I‚Äôm sorry I purchased two bottles.

Bottle too small for the price. Bottle is 8 oz and you can get 16oz for same price. Won‚Äôt buy from them again

Although it says you can use it as shampoo....DON'T.  My hair was so greasy after I used it that I had to use Dawn dishwashing soap TWICE to finally get my hair clean. I started with regular shampoo but that wouldn't cut the grease, only Dawn worked. I then used it on my laundry. When I got the clothes out of the washer they did not smell or feel clean at all. The smell is awful. Sadly, I had seen a promo video on this product that made it sound wonder so I stupidly made an impulse buy only to find out there is nothing wonderful about it.  I used this product 2 time and then threw the whole thing in the trash. I do not suggest this product for anything.

This product has been watered down. It's nowhere near the quality of the last bottle I bought a couple of years ago.  It's watery and I do not recommend.

I‚Äôve used Dr.Bronner‚Äôs over a decade or more and am very familiar with the smell and lather of the Peppermint soap. This was a super thin consistency it  did not smell of peppermint as I have known but smelled of Urine! I don‚Äôt know if it was the seller or a new formula but it was disgusting. Ugh. Returned.

Good product. Extremely high price. Could have paid about 5 dollars more for four times as much on Ebay. My mistake but still very unhappy.

In the 10 years using this product I never knew it came in this miniature sized bottle.  Just note regular sized bottle in all grocery stores across the US is 32 floz, this is 8floz.  You get 1/4th the amount for double the usual price.  If that‚Äôs what you want great, but otherwise avoid buying this!

This product is misleading and, in my opinion, deliberately misleading. These are tiny bottles that LOOK just like the regular sized bottles that are four times bigger. And they sell these tiny bottles for exactly the same price as the larger, full-sized bottles are sold in many brick and mortar stores. Is this a coincidence? I don't think so. I believe that they use these photographs and the price of the bottle to deliberately give the misleading impression that these are the regular sized bottles. Unfortunately, these tiny bottles are packaged in exactly the same way as the full sized bottles. This allows the seller in this case to pull off this misleading sales tactic. Save your money, buy the product from another source. I ended up paying a total of $22 for a tiny amount of this soap. The soap is great. The tiny bottle is ridiculous and misleading. I am moving and will be unable to return these, so I'm stuck. Buy the soap, by all means. It's great. Do not buy these tiny bottles.

Bought this on Amazon because I forgot to grab it at the store. The bottle at the store was $15 and this one was $9‚Ä¶ only difference was this bottle was a third of the size!!!! I will not purchase this again. Also, the overwhelming peppermint smell reminded me of the mint flavored milk of magnesia and I instantly felt nauseous.

Be aware that it can cause a burning sensation in sensitive areas.

I purchased this at Target and it was much thicker and this vendor seems to have watered it down? I will not be buying it again from Amazon.

Didn‚Äôt know it was small

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in this bottle but it‚Äôs not the soap that I have been buying for years, and the size is 8 ounces I should‚Äôve noticed that I was shocked at the size of the bottle I could buy 32 ounces of this stuff for about $13 at Trader Joe‚Äôs. I am returning this whatever is in this bottle is not Dr. Bonners soap

Size

Zero stars. I didn't notice this was the peppermint version not the baby unscented version. It lit my sensitive skin on fire exactly the opposite effect of the unscented version that is very soothing. Totally awful.

Good product but got half the amount for the same $$$ that I had paid previously for a 16oz bottle. READ READ READ the specs carefully... Will go elsewhere for gardening needs in the future.

This account is really taking the piss. The bottle is ridiculously tiny. I‚Äôve been buying this soap for decades. This is a rip off for the price. I‚Äôm also positive that the seller know this and is taking advantage of buyers. Well, first and last time buying from them.

Would not recommend

misleading, deceptive

Package came damaged , hard to get refund

I have extremely sensitive skin but never thought that this product would burn my skin.  I washed my hands with it and it turned my hands black and made me itch.  It may not happen to anyone else but it did to me.

DO NOT USE THIS STUFF IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!!! I had an allergic reaction and broke out in hives!!!!

This soap is like water. No scent and no consistency, looks and feels like water. Big waste of my hard earned Money!

I love this soap and order from Amazon all the time. When I opened the box this is what I saw. No top to the soap or the plastic that goes around to ensure it was not tampered with. Im beyond disappointed.

Not sure where the Hemp comes in.  Bought this many years ago and it just smelled like peppermint.  A body product MUST  smell good or the rest of it is a non-starter. Doesn't show hemp in the description, only if you enlarge the pic. Probably going to pitch it

I should have done a better job reading the description. Way too expensive for 8 ounces. Can find 16 ounces at this same price elsewhere.

Normally I love love love this stuff but I ordered peppermint and got baby scent?!

DO NOT BUY DR. BRONNER'S SOAP FROM THIS COMPANY, I purchased the peppermint scent and it was completely watered-down... they're despicable for trying to rob people of their hard earned money.

But I received a returned product. Usually I'm okay but not with body wash

This soap is super runny, like water, and it dried my skin out like crazy. Left me itchy and with red patches on my skin. Do not recommend

Very small for the price. Better off going to Walmart.

Bottle is Very small ! I seen the same one at target in a bigger size bottle for cheaper the price a couple days after I ordered it through Amazon don‚Äôt waste your money !

Opened the box and the seal was broken on bothe bottles and soap was coming down the side.

The bottle is too small for the price

Bottle was way to small for price paid

Bottle with little bit is much darker.  I received my bottles they're watered down  you can barely smell the Peppermint soap

Should have just said "Travel Size" in the title. This isn't worth almost $8.

This prodcut is way over priced for only 8 onces. comptetitors have 32 onces for a little more.

I didn't realize I bought soap from a cult. No thanks

Was a different solution

The best for clearly skin

Wish I would have paid attention to the ounces.  Way overpriced.  You're better off purchasing it at your local store.

the bottle was so small good scent

I love this product it‚Äôs a staple but seal was open so it‚Äôs a waste can‚Äôt use it

Love the product but not getting a tiny bottle for this price! You can easily get twice the size for the same price. Make sure you check what size bottle they are selling, when it arrives I was shocked at how tiny it is. It literally fits in the palm of my hand. Will not purchase from this seller again.

Bought to use as a pesticide for my plants. Did not work. Wanted to use something non toxic. Was more like non working

I love the scent but i feel an oily residue that's hard to wash off.

After reading some of the ingredients on this and doing some research, there are still some things in it that I don‚Äôt think are very safe. So I haven‚Äôt used but a couple times.

This bottle is WAY to small for the price. Also the product appears a little watery. Would not buy again

I was expecting a larger bottle, the peppermint smell, isn‚Äôt as strong as I thought it would be.

So I purchased Dr.Bronner Hemp peppermint from Amazon against my better judgement. Let‚Äôs just say my peppermint had no peppermint at all. Usually once you open the bottle a little squeeze gives you this awesome smell that radiate throughout the house once you have used it.. Not in this case I smelt nothing.Showered nothing‚Ä¶. Was so disappointed.  I‚Äôll get mine from Target moving forward, maybe I just got a bad bottle.ü§®

These bottles were shipped to me with both of the caps cracked and damaged. The soap is amazing, but the caps don‚Äôt limit the flow of the product. Amazon does not allow me to find a way to get the replacement caps. So I won‚Äôt be buying this again here.

Got a bottle 5 times this size for the same price somewhere else

I‚Äôve used Dr Bronner‚Äôs Peppermint Castille Soap for cleaning since the 1970‚Äôs. After I purchased the 8 oz bottle on Amazon I found a 16 oz bottle at Walmart for $2 more. Shame on me for not doing my research. Lesson learned.

I started using this soap in the late 1980's. I used to feel clean after washing with it but now it feels like wax is mixed in. My skin used to tinkle from the peppermint, but it's lack luster now. I guess nothing last forever. Why don't they just leave well enough alone. Like they say, if it's not broken don't try to fix it.

I didn't see it's so small 8oz when I can go to Walmart and get more for cheaper

This product was misleading based on price I assumed it was much larger. For the size I feel this soap should have been much less money. However, that‚Äôs what I got for not reading the label. Check the ounces people!

I can't believe 10.00 for 8 oz  my fault I didn't read it said I purchased it before not true. I would never purchase it again

Unfortunately it didn't work on our problem if aphids on lupine. Lost them all.

The hemp is overpowering the peppermint.

I was looking for a replacing for Bath and Bodyworks MENTHA bar soap. This is not it. The only cooling and tingling sensation you feel is on your nipples, arm pits, anus, tip of penis. The MENTHA was an invigorating sensation throughout your body. I was hoping to use this product similarly. If you want those areas to tingle this is the product for you. Also I will add that it spells very nice, subtly pleasant.

First I didn‚Äôt like the way this stuff smells. Second, I used this as an all over face and body wash. I had read that Castile soap was good for oily skin and could help with acne. Ummmmmm, not this stuff. I‚Äôm totally broken out all over my face!I‚Äôll use this soap as hand soap till it‚Äôs gone. I won‚Äôt ever purchase again.

I did not pay attention to the size before ordering, however for the price you can get a regular size bottle out of Walmart. Not really worth it!

The product is great!

Very versatile and useful.

Very small quantity for the price.

Half the size it was last time i bought it.

It‚Äôs OK but smaller than what I expected

Most of the writing on the bottle is unnecessary religious propaganda, and you would probably be safe ordering campsuds or some other organic soap. Smell isn‚Äôt too bad though.

Used in a spray bottle with 2 parts water but spiders returned less than a week later.

Beautiful Smell, but for Bathing, Broke out in itchy, itchy Rash. üò´

Nothing

This soap was a little to strong!

Wow. I didn't realize this was the little bottle. $18 for a small bottle is insane.The soap itself is great, but the giant bottle is more than twice the size for the same price at local grocery stores.Seriously blown away by the price. Won't be buying again.

Great product but very poorly packed!Leaking everywhere!!

Didn't like

I've used this soap for many years for various things and loved the scents and that it was natural. I used it as a body wash for a long time until I realized it was the cause of severe eczema I'd been developing. It is not a moisturizing soap whatsoever, actually it is extremely harsh on the skin. It took a while for it to start affecting my skin so if you suddenly start getting really dry and itchy randomly out of the blue it could be this. Tbh I can't find a great use for it now that I can't use it in the shower anymore, it's a decent all-purpose household soap but as harsh as it is, it still isn't particularly good as removing grease so it's not great for dishes either. I now keep it on hand for all purpose cleaning but I don't think I'd buy it again.

I only gave it 2 stars and here's why. I read alot of positive reviews about this product..while I was thrilled.. I was weary..but I bought it anyway. It's been more than a month now of using this product and I can't use it on my hair/scalp..my hair gets more tangles and falls out more and my scalp broke out in bumps. I can't use it on my face because I will breakout with alot of acne. When I used it on my body however..it worked really well..at first....and I was able to see all the dirt coming of my skin..but it left my skin super dry. But at least my legs and back wasn't breaking out in pimples as much..Sadly it didn't last..now I have acne every where and it's not going away..and my neck and chest have become red and itchy and scaly and feel sensitive to the touch! I'm never‚Äã buying this product again....

Very costly

Excellent product but like so many others, I thought the bottle would be bigger. I received an 8 oz bottle for $3 more than the last bottle I purchased which was larger. Now, the same 8 oz bottle I have that was gone in all of a week & a half is $1 MORE at $13.95?!There definitely seems to be a switcheroo around pricing & bottle sizes!

I have been using Dr. Bronner's soap for YEARS and this was the first time I purchased the soap through Amazon and not in-store. Needless to say, I was not expecting to pay ~$10 for an 8oz bottle when 32oz bottles are about $15. Wow. It's definitely important to check sizes when ordering from this app...

Didn‚Äôt want a 18-1 soap. Small bottle for $10. My son didn‚Äôt like it . It was for his son.

I definitely should have checked the reviews i thought it would‚Äôve been the big bottle. It wasn‚Äôt liquidy or watered down but the peppermint scent wasn‚Äôt as strong as the one i get at walgreens.

Use 1 capful in a spray bottle around your baseboards. Be careful if you have pets w/ essential oils bc this is strong. I also use it on stream mode to shoot wasps & bees in flight.  The size is small for the price. It's strong smelling & does the trick.  Have been using this for over 25 yrs for bugs.

I like the product for it's multi purposes.I disliked  the size for the price.

I saw the soap mentioned on tv, so I thought I'd try it.  It was ok.

Product great but tiny in size.

I should have paid attention to the ounces. This is overpriced.Love this soap, but this is overpriced.I guess I‚Äôll put this in my car bag.

Cleans hair leaving it feeling silky

This stuff is as thin as tap water. No thickness at all. I remember it being much thicker, where you were able to thin it to this consistency for use. I am able to use one single drop to clean my entire mouth guard and the case, but you often dispense more than the one drop you wanted to because it is so thin and not at all like the consistency of liquid soap. May transfer to a bottle with a dropper top, but it's annoying that it comes in a dispenser that dispenses more than you need.Highly recommend this product for cleaning mouth guards.

Just ok.

3 only bcs it was smaller than i thought. thought i was buying the big version.

Still very potent smell but compared to larger bottle purchased- this was watery.

Soup seems well done. Expensive per once cost.

Nice, fresh feeling, but very watery. It‚Äôs already an expensive product, so why do they have so sell you mostly water? The consistency is like that of fabric softener (not detergent).

While the soap is great for sensitive skin, it is way too runny!  It doesn't have any hold in your hand.  I'd get the bar soap next time.

I purchased to spray the roses to keep the Japanese beetles off.  Didn't work, they still ruined my roses.  Had to go back to flicking them into a jar of soap water.I did like it to wash my hands, but it didn't seem to get my dishes as clean.

For the price I thought it was the same size as the 16oz  bottle I had. But it came as 1/2  of the size so just be warned it is small, but about the same price as my large one.  It‚Äôs not listed in the title as 8oz

I thought it was larger. Expensive for the size

We love this products and brand, but they sent the wrong product and we wasn‚Äôt able to use it for the purpose of our buy. But no wort it to return it and buy it again (for time to wait the new product and distances to return place)

Everyday peppermint soap for a decent price.However , I hate being preached to with cultish writing spewed all over the bottle.. And I hate it even more when I'm naked in the shower. If you want to run a weird religious cult then it should be kept separate from your business.

I expected more from this based on all the hype it‚Äôs getting but it feel like regular good quality soap that you can get for cheaper.

Could smell better

Small bottle, didn‚Äôt see as potent as it usually is either. Not bad overall

Doesnt lather well in the shower, works better for other purposes

The product is good but the price is not. I suggest you buy this from your store and you'll find it much cheaper for so much bigger. I might tell a joke but ill never tell a lie

Good product but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the size, and this was a small bottle

I used this product to wash my clothes based upon a recommendation that it would remove a lingering odor from my denim.  Although it didn't work for me, it did wash my clothes well.  I'm sure it will clean other things as well.

I got this because peppermint is supposed to repel bugs and it had good reviews. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt smell very strong and it was very watery. I put it in the soap dispensers at my house and it does seem to be really good soap (this the three stars) I was just hoping it smelled stronger and I‚Äôd be able to stretch it a longer way. We will see how it goes

Such a good product, so expensive for such a small amount

Lather w/ soap is much better. Smells great though.

The consistency of the soap is extremely thin and it‚Äôs easy to get too much at once. I feel like too much is wasted and I‚Äôm trying to find a container that dispenses just a little bit at a time. The soap works nicely and has a wonderful fragrance.

If you like that ‚Äúminty‚Äù fresh feeling this is great but it does not lather all that well unless you use a lot of product I‚Äôm almost finished with it and purchased it not that long ago

The soap appears to be very diluted, compared to what you would expect and runs out fairly quickly. The bottle is also very small. I prefer more the hand soap that comes in a push bottle.

expensive for the size

Scent wasn't as strong as others say.Skin feels pretty dry after useCoolness of it was nice. Felt like menthol.

I really love this product. This is the first time ordering on Amazon versus going into the store.  It was not as thick as the product purchased from the store; seemed diluted a little.

I love this product but the bottles are too small for the price

I love this product but it's cheaper to buy out of the store

Seriously? No lid? What am I supposed to do after I open it??? And the seal was already messed up just a tiny bit. Enough to make the bottle slippery. Had there been a lid.....

This bottle has almost no mint smell.

Very watery but works

Could definitely do without the weird, poorly written, overly excited religious talk on the label, but the product seems decent.

Package came very late and when I opened it the seal was broken.

I will have to get back with my previous seller

So glad I looked for information on the bottle about the concentration level otherwise not worth the price.

but a thinner, less dense product (which I assume is the new hemp formula) that doesn't last nearly as long as the old castile only version. On the other hand, perhaps this can be used in pump dispensers? without clogging?

It was ok a little strong for me but I have super sensitive skin @ I probably just did not measure good.

I've had the original smaller bottle for 8 years that I just refill. Was buying a replacement. This bottle, the writing is wearing off after less than a year.

This natural soap gives you a nice minty feeling even after the wash. It suds well and leaves your skin clean. I will continue to purchase in larger sizes as this finished in a week with 2 adults daily use.

This product has numerous benefits in cleaning your house, laundry and yourself. It pays to read the side of the bottle.

Hadn't tried it yet.  Will update my review when bottle is emptying. Petty tiny bottle for the price. Hope it works

I thought I was getting a bigger bottle for that price but that wasn't the case.

I'm a big fan of Dr. Bronners soaps. They really make you feel clean. The only negative comment is that the bottle was smaller than when I buy it at the store for the same (or less) price.

I read online about using small amount of this mixed with water in spray bottles for plants to help keep insects away and not harsh like Dawn is which I‚Äôve tried watered down and still killed plants. I‚Äôve used this on several flowers as well as some vegetables and the issue I had is now pretty much obsolete so I would recommend. I needed something that my dogs wouldn‚Äôt be drawn to and that wouldn‚Äôt hurt if they tried but none of the 3 are interested in. I got the mint which also helped deter deer which I‚Äôm not sure if I got lucky or they don‚Äôt like the scent. I think great alternative to insecticidal soap. The bottles arrived quickly and in perfect sealed condition. I‚Äôll be able to use this small bottle for quite awhile and I have a very large garden and several flower beds.

This soap has a very watery consistency but does eventually foam up. It leaves your skin feeling very clean. Lots of peppermint though! Won't use on my gentle areas...seems like it would burn. Good for the upper body though. Probably would purchase the non scented version next time.

It's a very strong peppermint smell, which is what I expected. I've been using the almond scent and love it. I'm glad I gave it a try, but will probably stick with the almond scent.  Both of them leave your skin tingling after, soaping with it.  ike the products and will probably try the lavender scent too.

The Peppermint soap is good I‚Äôm obsessed with it but the Peppermint smell isn‚Äôt as strong as people are saying, even after not watering it down. Honestly the smell wears off after like a minute for me.If you use this as a shampoo your scalp will start to whisper to you.

I plan to use it for shampoo and upon reading directions I realized I needed another container or a foam dispenser.

I work in a dirty environment learned about it through a co worker! use after i get home from work but not in the morning. only when i come home from workjust not gonna buy here found the 16oz bottle for $9.00 sooooooo I saw this address was some ones home. I guess another post covid mom trying to make a profit smh at our expense

I love Dr. Broner's. It's really good stuff. It's real what they sell but you can get much better deals in larger quantities

I love Dr Bronner's all natural body wash. For women, be aware, if using the hemp peppermint body wash, your hoo-ha will burn! I learned to not use it on the intimate parts.

See above

I like the product but make sure you don‚Äôt let it get in your private parts. I loved how it made me felt refreshed

I LOVE THE SCENT. MY HUSBAND LOVES HOW IT MAKES HIM FEEL. TINGLY LOLIT IS VERY THIN, NON-SOAPY

I enjoyed the peppermint soap.It was soothing and cooling to My skin and joints the only issue was it's a little pricey for the size.

I love peppermint,  but you should be aware that it is very intense.  If you are using a lot of it, you need to be prepared to smell like Santa's village for several days.

Order got here on time and is fine

Great size for a great price! The only thing is the top broke easily when the bottle fell which made most of the soap spill. Other than that, great buy

You must dilute but it really cleans your skin leaving it feeling refreshed.

Been using for 15 plus years.  A little expensive, but then again other mint body soaps never seemed to be as invigorating and cleansing.  considering they last a long time, worth the extra $$ for a superior product.

I like this scent, I couldn't found it in large container when i bought the last ones but I will try to find this one next time, I like it better.Not perfect for everything but I am happy to know that is environmental friendly and natural so this is good to me.I recommend this, special this scent that i like it. feels refreshing on your skin and head.

A friend suggested Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Castile Soap as a way to get rid of and keep those tiny black ants that sometimes invade kitchens in summer under control. I alternate between this soap and distilled white vinegar to wipe down on the counters, window seals and doorways when doing a deep clean to keep the ants at bay. So far so good.

I really like the fact that a very little goes a very long way with this soap. The only thing that I DON"T recommend is using it for shampoo! After I started using it on my hair, I noticed that I was loosing handfuls of hair while/after I would shower, but thought it was just a coincidence. After the 2nd, 3rd, 4th days of using it, I was still loosing HANDFULS of hair in the shower, but decided I would give it a go for 1 week before giving up. After 1 week of using it on my hair, I felt like I literally lost half the hair on my head. It was HORRIFYING!! Definitely NOT RECOMMEND AS SHAMPOO!!!

If it smelled like a smell I want to use time and again then I would be happy.  Like Irish Spring soap would be more to my liking

I purchased this soap when a favourite blogger of mine recommended it for cleaning makeup brushes.  I have to say, nothing else I've tried has ever done such a thorough job of cleaning my brushes.  Brushes previously stained pink are now white again!I haven't tried this soap for anything else but I might in the future.  I gave it a 4 star rating because although I enjoy the peppermint scent, there is an underlying scent that it leaves behind that I don't like.  Perhaps it comes from the hemp or one of the other oils used as an ingredient but I really don't care for it.Having never tried any of the other scents, I have no idea if this is a common occurrence with Dr. Bronner's soap.  I would definitely try another scent though because I love how effective the soap is and how little I need to use.

Same great quality as always. Refreshing and effective. The price on the 8oz. is high, but its convenience is very helpful. So, I'm satisfied with this superior product.

Watch out for the size! Deceptive on the photos what size you're actually getting.

Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Peppermint Soap has been one of my favorites for 20+ years. Love the smell and the aromatherapy effect after a shower! It‚Äôs the best!

I use this for my plants, 1 T to a Qt of water, and spray for pests. If I used this for other stuff, I think I would try to find a better price per ounce.  Stores in my area usually carry it and its twice the amount for almost the same price, but it's been sold out lately so I had to get some for my veggies!  Shipped quickly and no leaks, so no complaints there.

Smells great and makes you feel refreshed BE SURE TO DILUTE!!!!

Thankfully the seal kept the contents contained, but the cap was completely cracked and useless.

I love the tingling feeling that this wash feels on my face. It has a peppermint smell. Love it

This stuff is great, BUT WARNING TO MEN: be careful using this in the shower. When in used in areas not discussed at parties, it burns!!! It‚Äôs like freezer burn on your most sensitive parts. I use it now for hand soap and I love it!

All you need is a little bit and feel the cool peppermint on your skin

Use for many things! Use a drop in mop water. Use a drop to soak feet in. Great for numerous things.

At first i was worried but it had been one of the best soaps I‚Äôve tried. The clean feeling the feeling of peppermint. It‚Äôs amazing

I love the sent

Wow I have try many many soaps! But this one ‚òùÔ∏è I have skin problems! I just use it and I‚Äôm writing the review already!

It‚Äôs an amazing product I just wish someone would‚Äôve warned me not to use it in sensitive areas.Other than than I don‚Äôt need much, last‚Äôs long and doesn‚Äôt foam too much.

I read about this product and I'm sure it's a healthier choice but I was disappointed at how short a time the product lasted. I had read that a little goes a long way when showering but it does not. I like the product but can't afford to continue to buy it.

I used it for my body and hair had my hair very nice and soft  I recommend it but the bottle is kinda small for the price

I like it, but the peppermint oil is VERY strong. Be careful around eyes and delicate anatomical areas.

Used it on my 100 mile hike in Maine.  Was great to only need such a small amount.  Gonna take it with me on my hike in Florida in November.

A friend told me that wiping down kitchen surfaces with Dr. Bronners (or other real peppermint oil) discouraged mice. It seems to be true. You do need to repeat it every day though. We have intermittent mouse problems (they get in this old house) and I seriously do not want to use poison. And I really hate to set traps. This is not poison and it smells nice.

It is a good product

Has a really strong smell; sometimes therapeutic but sometimes overwhelming. Overall, I like the clean and cool effect feeling that I get from using this! :--)

it's ok

Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap has been around forever but has become increasingly difficult to find in stores. I was delighted to find this one available on Amazon. It is a great product, gentle and effective and makes you smell wonderful whether you are using it to shower, shampoo, wash dishes or clothes while camping, or a million other applications. Just be sure you know what size you are ordering. I am accustomed to a 16 oz bottle and was kind of surprised when this one arrived to see that it's only 8 oz. Shame on me for not reading more carefully before I ordered. It's a great product that I have used for almost 50 years. And someday when you're really bored read the entire label. It's a trip!

I was leery of an environmentally, friendly soap, but found out it works really well. After using it hiking in Wyoming for six days I am now a true believer. I used it to wash dishes, hands, and even hair and it did a great job every time. It smells great too. I ended up dividing the bottle up into smaller bottles for other people in the group and didn‚Äôt get close to using the whole bottle and everyone loved it and smelled fresh and clean. Now we are using it around the house and plan on ordering more as soon as we finish this bottle.

This peppermint dr bonners make me feel sooooo fresh. The smell is strong, it last long, and it make me feel so clean. The ingredients are pure, must dilute to use on your skin but I even clean my home with it. It‚Äôs versatile on use.

I have been buying this product for a while now and use it to wash my makeup brushes. The smell is nice and it gets my brushes nice and clean. It is not harsh on my brushes. Will continue to use.

Very nice cleanser. A true concentrate, only needs a few drops to be effective.

Works well , love the smell.

This pure soap is concentrated and does not require much for each use. Finding a good quality "all around" wash has been frustrating in most stores. Finding this product on Amazon was easy and the delivery quick.

I love the smell of this soap, the fresh organic vibe my skin puts off for an hour after a shower. I had been using a friend‚Äôs and hers must have been watered down because when I used mine on my ‚Äòdown there‚Äô areas, I was rinsing it out for 10 minutes afterwards in a half-panic haha! It‚Äôs peppermint, so you know, it has a bite. For the rest of my skin it‚Äôs great. I just use the tiniest bit, this stuff is concentrated. I think as you use it you can probably keep adding water to top it up for a while, will probably last ages. I also put a few drops in a sprayer with a lot of water, and use it to wipe down the bathroom and kitchen counters. Leaves the faintest fresh smell. Definitely recommend this product!

I literally swear by Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap! It leaves me feeling so clean and squeaky. It literally gets all of the dirt off of you. It is also multipurpose  so I often put a few drops into my mop water. I would advise making sure to moisturize well after washing your body with it just to make sure that your skin doesn't feel dry.

Reorder used for everything  cleaning with soap deters insects gentle on skin / hair / fragile fabric  This bottle too small for price

Mixed this with oil to spray on plants to get rid of aphids. Seemed to work.

I have loved this brand of soap forever

Absolutely love this soap! Haven't used anything else since I bought it.

Love this

This is the perfect body wash that also doubles as a shampoo. I love the pepperminty scent.

I love this product. It feels so clean on my skin. I love the peppermint smell!

This makes me clean and cool at the same time. Love it!!

This soap is so good, I feel as if I washed all of my sins away! I would recommend keeping this product away from private areas.

I fell in love with this soap in NYC while a poor graduate student. The price has increased exponentially. But I still love the bright peppermint fragrance.

My order came promptly, wrapped perfect and the bottle was in good shape!

I do not brush my teeth with it

I use this on the daily. I just love the scent and the minty feeling it leaves me with after.

Love the scent. Great addition to my cleaning products

this is a great product for cleansing the body-the fragrance is very refreshing. I have been using thisproduct since 1989 and continue to use it. You can use it form various applications.

This is good stuff and has been forever

I tried this soap at my son's house simply because it was available in the shower. I loved it!  My daughter-in-law gave me all the information and why they use it. I am so pleased.

Honoring You Dear Ones

Tried it on vacation at an airb&b. LOVED IT. Glad I ordered some for myself. Works just like it says. On.y very small amount needed.

Just as advertised! Bronners is the best

Work for every thing like the bottle says.

I first got a tiny bottle of this soap in a hotel room some time ago. Really works well‚Ä¶ just a few drops you can wash your hair a few more drops you can wash your body. I love the tingle from the peppermint oil. That little bottle was almost empty and I was happy to find a bigger bottle available on Amazon. Little bit goes along way so this bottle will last a long time.

Best soap I‚Äôve ever used. Hands DOWN.

Very concentrated...remember to dilute ...leaves you squeaky clean

This product work up a great lather when diluted with water. Definitely gets you squeaky clean!

Love using for shower gel

This classic soap is outstanding.  I love it for camping trips.

I have been using moisture this for years .I love how it cleans my skin wish they had a lotion.Because it dries the skin so it has to be followed by a really good lotion to put back moisture .Maybe they make a lotion I just haven‚Äôt seen .

I love peppermint and the sting will wake you up in a great way , on my 2nd bottle!

I have used Dr Bs for years and years. All was great with delivery  etc. Ty

The price on this is terrible. It's way cheaper at Walmart and other places. It's still an amazing product tho

I am just obsessed with this soap! It smells great, even when diluted. It doesn‚Äôt make my skin dry, but I am sure to moisturize after use. It lasts forever, too!

On hot muggy days using this body wash feels so good and refreshing to my skin. It makes you feel refreshed and extra clean.

I bought this to make a diluted peppermint spray to use outside to keep bugs away and it's amazing. I also use it to mop my basement where there seems to be more bugs that hang out. I like that you can dilute it so many different ways and use it to clean almost anything at the right ratio. I bought this when it was on sale, so I got a little more for my money but definitely think it's worth a try if you're on the fence about it. I also like that it's safe around my pets and plants which was another big selling point for me.

Great for use in the garden for bug control.

Dr. Bronner's is the best.

Used a concoction made with this recommend for killing pest on plants, appears to have worked.

Great

excellent product

Nontoxic and works amazing to remove dust.

Light scent,very effective on skin, very gentle and it doesn't cause dryness. Convenient size.

I'm a PRIME member and was charged more for shipping and handling than for the actual product.  3 Calls to Amazon Customer Support escalating to a Supervisor who told me the vendor would make it right.  It's been a month with no follow up and nobody "making it right".

I ordered a package of 6 bars of soap and only received 1 bar

This was for 2 bars and I only received one.!

Only 1 soap in the package

We love this soap! So we sent some to my Sis in law. Package was delivered and it was Empty.No Soap just a empty bag!

I really wanted to like this. I do not have sensitive skin at all however this broke me out bad.

I thought I was ordering the liquid soap. Not what I wanted

This soap made me breakout and cause a burning sensation

Only 1 bar of soap arrived, not 6.

I love this soap but it just arrived with an unbelievable amount of plastic packaging!

Scam! One bar smelled great! The other bar had no smell of peppermint at all!!!

Not a nice scent

It breaks me out

Way too expensive. Nice and minty when you first open the bar then nothing.

No odor to the soap, it was also yellow like it was an old product not new.

This product has changed tremendously.In my opinion it no longer have you feeling refreshed.

Allergic.  Dont recommend for eczema sufferers.Had high hopes.  Disappointing.

This soap smells nice and all but if I could go back and time and stop myself from purchasing it I would. This soap has made my body dependent on it. When I was first using the soap everything was fine however when I stopped my whole body broke out into a rash. I couldn't live my life without itching every other second. I tried everything I could think of lotion, creams, topical steroids, calamine. I went to my doctor and was prescribed oral steroids they didn‚Äôt work. Then I developed dyshidrotic eczema, I sought out a dermatologist and they couldn‚Äôt even help me it was only until I started using this soap again that everything stopped. This is torture -100000000/5

Dr. Bronner's Castile Peppermint soap smells pleasant before use and soaps up on a sponge or wash cloth with ease.  The trouble begins when you start to wash your skin, at least on much of mine.  Almost immediately after the first application, my skin began to burn like fire, especially on my face and groin area.  It was so painful that I had to use another soap and a lot of water to get the residue off as soon as possible.  Even then it burned for a few more minutes before going away.Reading all of the other compliments posted here for the product, I notice one other commenter that barely mentioned this problem.  This is totally baffling.  For me, it meant throwing the stuff out.  I was so annoyed that I didn't even save it for something where it might work well, like a flea bath for the dog.  Maybe without the peppermint it would be O.K., but I'll never know, because I'll never buy any more of it.

This is my favorite soap and the only one that works well with my skin. BUT I orders this on September 3 and they keep pushing my shipping back. Still have not received my soap!

While I love that this product is eco and animal friendly, this is NOT for ladies that might have sensitive skin or are prone to imbalance "down there".  The stuff is way harsh and can mess up your sensitve balance even if not used directly.Just a warning to all the Ladies. I've found soaps like Aubrey Organics Herbal Liquid Everyday Body Soap are a much better alternative.

My mom bought this and the Eucalyptus bar soap, I'm not sure where, but I'll guess bath and body. The bar soaps SUCK! I don't feel anything, NOTHING AT ALL! There's no scent, it's just a block of white soap!

Broke out my skin omg !!!

Very disappointing, it made hubby‚Äôs hair full of dandruff

This product has barely any scent at all  , so you must wonder if those that have given such great reviews , work for the company. It is garbage , there are many cheap soaps that have far better scents than this and for the price of one , i could have bought 12 bars of my favourite soap ,palmolive . Of course , they add insult to injury , by forcing you to buy 2 bars at a cost of ¬£7.98 . What a racket .  DO NOT BUY !

It smells like I‚Äôm washing my body and hair with toothpaste and dental floss. Not what I was expecting.

Barely smelled like peppermint

Bought this to try and reduce plastic consumption.  Guess what?  It comes wrapped in plastic.  Absolutely no need as it's already wrapped in paper.

Barely noticed it. Plus didn't last long

I haven't notice any difference on my skin I unfortunately doesn't work for me :-(

I was expecting a nice peppermint smell. No such luck. I used only one bar. Going to give away the others.

Honestly, I didn't see everything it promises.  Lost money!

I ordered two 6 packs of these. They came wrapped in clear plastic. Out of 12, 7 of them were dented and the paper wrapper looked like they slid across the factory floor or something. At five bucks a bar I expect better. Wrote a similar review last year for the same problem. Guess it's time to buy a different brand.

Paid for a two pack and only got one bar for $10+!

I thought they were the large soap bars. I would never have paid 5.00 for a small bar of soap

Great product, but overpriced.  The day after it delivered, a local grocery had the same product for $2.00 less.

Cleans nice, smells great. But, uh, and I should have known this going in. But this soap has menthol in it. Do NOT leave this product in contact with your genitals or anus, it will burn. Though, if you take showers and rinse quickly it's fine for washing. Probably best as hand, rather than bath soap.The liberal propaganda on the package is creepy, and although the soap is nice I won't buy it again for that reason. Get a clue.

First of all, I really like Dr Bronner's soaps. The two main reasons: First, I do not smell like the soap all day long and they rinse clean.This is the second time I have purchased the Peppermint soap from an online source and BOTH times, the scent is NOT peppermint. The scent is closer to Tea Tree. Maybe the bars sat in a warehouse next to something and absorbed the scent.The lather and rinsing is still good, so I am not going to return the bars. I will just purchase locally, where I can smell the bars before I pay for them.

The nutri bullet is when of the best products on the market when it's working; however, mine stopped working after six months so I question the quality of construction. I only used it two to three times a week and was meticulous about cleaning and caring for the produce. I'm very disappointed and at this price point I'm hesitant to order again.

I love Dr. Bronner products, I do not love the bar soap. The scent is lacking in comparison to the liquid soap. Avoid.

I couldn't wait to smell that amazing scent before I even open the wrapper! So dissapointing, did you change your formula Dr. Bronner? This is my second batch that has been this way. Please go back to the original formula. I will have to get my peppermint fix elsewhere .

Soap leaves your skin feeling nice and clean but at the same time dry. After about a weeks worth of use for some reason it is leaving our skin extremely tight and dry. I don't understand all the great reviews about this particular soap however it doesn't work for us unfortunately.

Ah, the peppermint smells so good, but this soap is so drying that I had to discontinue using it.

not that great. smells like peppermint but the scent doesn't seem to linger on the skin.

not what I expected

The peppermint bar version of this soap is good soap.  It lathers well, and gets the job done.  The peppermint smell is nice.  That said, the stuff is not worth even 50% of the asking price.  As far as soap goes, most cheaper bar soaps do the job just as well.

Maybe I just got a bad bar, but there was almost no peppermint in it.  It used to leave the skin cool and tingly all over, the peppermint was so strong.  I hope I just got a bad one, but they were always very consistent in the past.  Maybe Dr. Bronner should stop making "magic" chocolate bars, and focus on the soap again.

I like the smell, but it did leave a weird waxy, sticky, tacky feeling on my skin after showering... like waxy film or something. I had re-shower with a regular bar of Dove to wash the stickiness off. It was a gift from my nephew, so I'm just using it as a hand soap bar. Still leaves a sticky feeling on my skin after using though. I wonder if I got a bad batch? I loved the lavender bar version I used before this, and that one didn't leave a sticky film on my skin.

iv been useing a organic natural chemical free soap for few years for the big bar (8bucks) I bought this bar of soap from a local health store I have heard such great things about it for the price of 10 bucks I had to try it. I was so excited I went into the bathroom with my soap cutting knife (I like to use smaller peaces at a time to a avoid waist) this thing would not cut it just crumbled. That was a huge turn off so I had to have my boyfriend fix the darn soap so it didn't look stupid and I threw the tiny shavings that I couldn't use into the bath to use as bubble bath. They didn't bubble at all. I had to scrub it so hard on m bath poof o get it to bubble it left my skin so dry and stripped my boyfriend had to rub me down with my organic vanilla bean oil so I wouldn't flake. Then he accidentally washed his hair with it insted of out other brands shampoo bar his hair was waxy and discussing! After the bath I had to scrub my bathtub because it left such a nasty film ( almost gray all over! ) I will never use this product again I don't even feel right giving it away now to throw away a 10 dollar bar of soap. Everyone save ur time go to chagrin valley Cheeper better quality more choices I'm sticking to this.

Smells wonderful but was like using floor stripper on my skin.  Not an ounce of moisture left on my body.

I neither like or dislike the scent, but it‚Äôs just similar to some cheap soap like Dial or Irish Spring which is dry out my skin so bad. Whenever i use it for my hair, i feel it‚Äôs gonna sticky my head for whole day

I have been on a soap kick for the last three months trying out several soaps from all over the World including Speick & LaToja.I was recommened Dr. Bronner's Lavender soap and after using it I was very impressed with it for not only my body, but it worked great in my hair as well.I recently was on a weekend trip in Vermont and noticed the local store had Dr. Bronner's Peppermint in stock so I picked up a bar.It lathered just as well as the Lavender but when I got to my "Man Parts" it stung like Hell!My Wife also used it and said it stung her "Lady Parts" as well.To the trash it shall go...

I bought this from Target but wanted to leave a review where peoole would see it. It smells real nice but it does leave my skin feeling sticky. Kind of like how hotel soaps make your skin feel. It did clear my sinuses though and it's cruelty free so that's great.

I use this stuff as an all-in-one for bathing and washing my hair.  I even tried brushing my teeth with it once just for kicks.  It was gross, but I didn't die.  Anyway, the reason I gave this two stars is because you can get this cheaper by the bar at Trader Joe's (at least where I live).

The Soap is great but the price is a ripoff cvs has it for way cheaper

This smells ok-ish, but reminds me of a soap from the 70's.It feels quite sticky using it compared to Dove soap, and to me this stuff feels like the cheap Cien soap you get from Lidl for under ¬£1.I've fallen for the hype, make sure you don't too!

It does have a slightly minty tingle but the smell is not strong enough.

Smells amazing when new as soon as packet is removed. Once wet you can't smell a thing. Rubbish really!

I'm super picky about my soaps , especially if it doesn't lather well in a washcloth. This soap smelled great, lathered really really well and rinses off leaving you feel super clean and smelling great. Not a strong lingering smell of peppermint after but you feel and smell  the mint during your shower.  Super happy with my purchase.

Love this soap! It not only smells great, it has helped my skin issues. I have very sensitive skin. I usually can't use soap that smells like anything. I can use this one. I wouldn't recommend for those lady bits but for the rest of your body it's perfect!

I love this soap!  I love the peppermint fragrance and it doesn‚Äôt dry your skin.

Makes the entire bathroom smell fresh. Better than any air freshener!! And not as toxic!

Love that there are no additives to this product.  Leaves the skin feeling clean.  Does run out faster than other bar soaps that do have additives, but being healthy costs more!

This is great bar soap and my favorite scent. I just ordered more of it too. I am also waiting for the same soap in liquid to arrive.The bars are good for bathing in the shower without a washcloth. They‚Äôre also good for washing hands and even dishes and plastic items.

This smells great, a good peppermint smell when you sniff the bar and a faint smell when you leave the shower.  It lathers better than expected.  I just rub some on various spots, put the soap away, and then lather on myself.  I don't think I've ever used bar soap, but I've wanted to move away from chemicals and endocrine disrupters so here I am.  The one thing I will say is that it seems to be a bit drying.  For me, I notice it right after getting out of the shower and then I'm good shortly after.  You may want to consider that if you have dry skin.

This soap is more expensive that other bar soaps but it is more than worth it. In my opinion, this soap lasts 3 to 5 times longer than regular bar soap, has better lathering and smells fresher. Don't cheap out. Try it!

Wanting to switch to more quality hygiene products. I clean professionally and a client keeps a big liquid bottle of this in her shower. I wanted to try the bar version with a soap sack and see how things went. I love it! It gets me squeaky clean, not overly peppermint-y, and I don‚Äôt feel dried out afterwards. It‚Äôs going to be carrying me through winter!

I have never tried the bar previously.  Now I believe, although both tremendous products!  The bar lasts longer than the 16oz bottle!  Love all their products!

The soap isn't bad. It smell decent while using it, but doesn't leave a Peppermint smell on your skin. It just leaves a waxy generic soap smell. The soap lathers nicely, but leaves waxy/tacky feel on your skin. I have used it for three days the bar is already half the size it started as, son will only probably last a week or week & half. Not a bad soap, but unsure if I will purchase again.

I love the scebt and that is why I bought it, however not as strong as the liquid soap.I didnt realize it was made from hemp. It last exactly 6 days if showering every day. Not much in my opinion, even though it loiks like a big soap

THE SOAP: It's gentle and cleans my hyper-sensitive skin thoroughly but without triggering rashes. I never have that tight, dry feeling after using this soap that I do with so many other harsher cleansers. And this peppermint scent is heaven in a closed, hot shower. I will buy this scent again, for sure.THE SELLER: While the item arrived in time, the bars of soap were secured together using clear plastic tape, so when I tried to take them apart all of the paper wrapping on the soap ripped off. Lame. Now storing the soap‚Äîkeeping it dust-, lint-, and hair-free‚Äîis an annoyance 'til I can use them all. I won't buy from this seller again.

I love this stuff.  I normally buy from Wally World at 3.47 a bar when they have it, kinda surprised that Amazon sells same thing for twice the money.  Product is great though.

I've been using this exclusively for bathing and it works well enough. But I can't  smell the peppermint, I thought I bought the unscented one by accident!

The product is very good but it dries my skin out if I overuse it. Personal problem because I have soft sensitive skin but it‚Äôs a little annoying. Love how clean it makes you feel though

Love the smell . Decent soap . Doesn‚Äôt give that cool refreshing feeling when you get out the shower like everyone says... jus regular

Not sure what‚Äôs In this that irritated me, smells great though I just wouldn‚Äôt recommend to ppl with sensitive skin

I would like to preface this review by saying that this is for the  PEPPERMINT scented soap ONLY.This peppermint soap,although extremely pleasant scented,is a bit too irritating to the skin. The peppermint gives a burning sensation to the the sensitive areas of the body as well. I  also believe  it may also create an itchiness to skin .That being said however, I do like the other aspects of the soap, I believe I will try another scent other than peppermint.

I recommend you buy the Orange Soap instead (I give the Dr Bronners Orange Citrus Soap 5 Stars) The peppermint soap is nice but the peppermint oil is a bit much for sensitive areas of the skin and breathing in the vapors may be strong for some.

So there is nothing wrong with this soap.  However, when 1 bar costs more that a 12 pack of regular bar soap, my expectations were pretty high.  I purchased the peppermint and there is nothing really to rave about.  It causes a mild tingling and cooling sensation, but not anything to justify the price.

It‚Äôs okay but I thought it would be a stronger peppermint smell. It‚Äôs pretty weak so I‚Äôll keep buying my homemade peppermint soap from Etsy.

Love the smell and the texture of the product. Leaves skin feeling great as well as a person feeling refreshed. Only problem and it's a big one considering the  price is that it doesn't last at all. I thought the 6 bars I bought would last 6 months. I was wrong getting about 2 weeks a bar.  Will probably go back to L'occitane..

It smells nice, but I thought it was just meh.

I love the fragrance.  But it doesn't work on body odor.

Loved the way this soap made my skin feel. Loved the way it cleaned my face too. so relaxing, but unfortunately I can't use it. my skin won't allow it....

This is a nice bar soap, but it does not have the tingly feeling or the potent fragrance of Dr. Bonner's liquid peppermint soap.  I shall buy the liquid form next time.

I am a lover of the Dr. Bronner's liquid peppermint soap but do not love the bar.  The lather was not as rich and the scent was much milder than I was used to.  I will not re-purchase the bar soap.  I can suggest this to those who found the liquid soap too strong.

Smells great just left tons of soap scum in the tub that needed cleaning attention.

I was head over hills to try this. But for some odd reason. It's ok but not as good as the body wash. You would think it has the exact same ingredients in it. But I can tell a difference in the two. I prefer the body wash.

Smells great!!...cleans skin nice!!

It  was my as good asThe liquid form and this not  last as long as expected

The soap is nice because it is natural. The smell was wonderful when I opened the package but when I used it in the shower, it didn't smell at all, felt like i was rubbing animal fat on my body, NOT clean feeling at all and no scent. Kept them to use around my bathrooms to release scent but horrible option for cleansing.

Not as pepperminty as liquid

Not impressed

Smells wonderful, but scent does not linger at all on body. It does make me feel clean without any residue left on my skin.

Great soap, but it took 8 days to ship it.

The liquid soap is much better.

Unfortunately the bars lose most if there peppermint essence after only a few uses. Still effective as soap.

VERY minty!!! Almost too much.

Love the soap but its pricey.

It stops smelling as it did when brand new, unused.

It takes lots of hot water and rubbing to release the 1st blast of peppermint scent from Bronner's Castile Bar Soap. It was great for the first 3 or 4 showers  and even made the entire bathroom smell great for a few minutes after the shower.The smaller the bar of soap gets the less amount of scent per square inch you get. Now, 2 months later, there is still a bit of soap left to use but NO SCENT.This is as opposed to
Peppermint 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)
which I bought at the same time for around the same price, but it maintains its potency because little chunks of actual peppermint leaves permeate the entire bar of soap.Bronner's Castile Bar Soap Peppermint is fun at first, but ultimately not worth the money.

No zing. After trying out the peppermint bar soap I decided to reorder the liquid.  I was trying to be ecologically responsible and reduce my use of plastic bottles. I live in a very hot place and the liquid peppermint soap has a real zing to it that drastically cools the skin. The bar soap does not do that at all. I'll use the bar soap for winter.

Great value. I love how the soap is versatile. Although, it didn‚Äôt work for my skin. I have normal skin. I rarely get dry skin. I decided to try this soap bar because of the outrageous positive reviews & reputation. I noticed after using this soap in the shower, my skin is not only super dry but it is very itchy. I am getting almost rash marks on my skin if I scratch it. Good thing is I don‚Äôt have to toss this soap bar out, I‚Äôll just use it for other uses.

I think it dries the skin a bit, and also burn private areas especially rear one....Peppermint is very strong

Just soap

Product is great, delivery was annoying

UPDATE: the bar only lasted two weeks with daily bathing!!! It's ok. Not especially moisturising. Non allergenic. Very nice and clean. No oily residue. Very Weak scent but you can feel essential oil tingling. Doesn't last long, my bar will last about a month I think with daily showers. Nice and gentle to use for hair. I will buy again because its gentle and natural but I have previously used richer Castile soaps. EDIT : I bought the liquid version of it, it is much better. Stronger scent,one small bottle lasts ages as you just need a couple drops. Much more moisturising, just as tingling. Much easier to wash hair. Recommend the liquid version not the bar version

Looks great, not very minty though. Bit disappointing.

We absolutely love dr. bronner's peppermint bar soap!!  Thought I would give it a try as I found it on sale somewhere and bought 1 bar.  Oh, boy!  We just love the scent, lather and fresh feeling without all those nasty chemicals in other products.  Our granddaughter who is 4 yrs old smelled it and asked if she could take it home with her for her house.  BTW, I have very sensitive skin very dry skin, and it doesn't bother me in the least.  Love the product.  Never change your ingredients, Dr. Bronner!!!!!  PLEASE

Not as strong on the peppermint as I remember. I think I prefer the liquid version. To save, maybe wash with another soap then use this soap as a final moisturizer.

Ok

I love this brand. I love everything from this brand. I am just not sure if the pack saves you any money.

Not sure if the scent is peppermint, kind of have a medicinal smell.otherwise I would give five stars.

The soap is nice, it is a little pricey and if you keep in shower, its going to melt down fast!

It is nice bath soap. I wish the peppermint was a little stronger but it is very nice

Pretty good soap. I read the reviews and it raised my expectations to a level that the soap did not reach. The scent and the 'cool' feel are okay, but not what I thought they might be. I bought 5 bars and will use them, but I probably will continue my search for a better product. The peppermint does NOT make you tingle and the peppermint decreases as you use the bar of soap. I'm toward the end of a bar and it just smells like soap and zero tingle...  Still, pretty good, just not a big deal and not worth the price.

I enjoyed the scent of this soap and have not experienced any negative reactions on my skin, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but the bar has been used up much quicker than I had hoped for.I am unsure whether I‚Äôll be purchasing it again in the future, but I enjoyed it for the time I had it. The cost to length of time using is a concern.

I prefer the liquid version of this particular soap but the bar does what it‚Äôs supposed too and the scent is invigorating. I like it and would buy again for the price.

WARNING: DO NOT USE THE PEPPERMINT SOAP IN YOUR PRIVATE AREA!  I will spare you the details. Trust me. Don't do it. Other than that, this stuff is great. It smells wonderful, but  doesn't leave me smelling like a peppermint stick.  It  rinses clean, which is one of the major reasons I wanted to try a more natural soap. Grocery store brand soaps always tend to leave a film. Body washes are better, but  the list of chemicals and other manufactured ingredients leave me concerned. This soap is gentle, natural, and does not leave a film. I'll buy again and will try other scents. It's good stuff, just keep it away from your naughty bits!

Dr. Bronners is great for the skin. It is a bit more expensive, but worth it. Love that it came in a 6 pack.

I use this with a Korean green cloth for exfoliating my skin once a week. Gives a squeaky clean feel. I will say, as a person with dry skin,  this is not moisturizing for me AT ALL. So if you use, MOISTURIZE!

I really liked this soap.  Here's what you need to know:It cleans well, and it's GREAT for sensitive skin.  If you have trouble with soaps that dry out your skin leaving a rash or something else, I would encourage you to try this product.  It really does work.The Peppermint smell:  It's fantastic!  Not overpowering, but not subtle either.  It's just rightThe only gripe I have:  I wish the bar was bigger.  You will go through this product fairly quickly.  I feel like the bar dissolves faster than other products I've used before and the bar is already smaller than other brands I've used.

I came across Dr.Bronner's for the first time,while I was shopping for hand soap at Costco.com. The reviews for the liquid soap with the same smell (pepper mint) seemed too impressive and i bought a couple of bottles.I instantly fell in love with them and started using them as hand soap,dish soap and in Laundry. This led me to look up a bath soap and I was happy to find peppermint bar soap at Amazon.I like it for being natural and for the cleaning power,while being gentle on skin. The only downside is the smell is not that strong like the liquid soap.Wish it was the "same strength" on Aroma.

I like that it‚Äôs moisturizing and it‚Äôs smells great.

This is a great natural soap that can be used for many different things and is great for your skin. The soap smells great and rinses clean, you actually do get a tingle when using the peppermint variety which I prefer, while some may not like that type of sensation. Additionally, this soap is great for many skin ailments such as mild acne/pimples which I can attest. The only negative would be that the soap is expensive but it does last a decent amount of time, as I can usually get about two-three weeks from each bar.

Like it would definitely use again

I have used this on my face and body. It is different than body wash or even a bar soap from the store. After bathing with it my hand would not glide across my skin like with other soaps. But, once I was dry, my skin felt fine.I don't think it works very well for shaving and do NOT use it in the bathtub, only use it in the shower. It left an awful film on the tub and the water felt really weird.My husband has a shaved head (very little hair) and he has used it all over and he likes it.Oh, and I would not recommend it for feminine areas.I do like the smell, but it does not make you feel cold like some people have said.

Good soap. I have sensitive skin and it didnt bother me, my daughter does too and said it burned a bit in sensitive areas. With most soaps, if I lather and rinse right away I'm okay. I've used better mint soaps, but this isnt bad. Doesn't strip the skin of oils but cleans well and is gently invigorating.

I have dry skin and it keeps me from getting zits

I enjoy Dr. Bronner's hard soaps a lot - I used the Lavender scented bar for a three month trip across Europe and Asia, and it works like a dream! You can wash clothes, hair, and body with this soap. It lathers extremely well.The one rather large issue that I have is with the Peppermint soap itself; every female I know who has also used the peppermint hard soap complains about using the soap on private parts! They all say it gives a burning sensation "down there" that is not quite comfortable.I think I will stick with the Lavender for now.

This is the first time I tried the bar of soap vs the liquid version. It is less scented and has less of that peppermint tingle than the liquid soap has. Still good smelling soap that gets you clean.

The scent and feel of this soap is amazing. Best soap ever.

Purchased based on other reviews. I purchased mostly for travel use. Instead of packing a bunch of 3-1-1- shampoos, body soaps, laundry soaps, etc. I pack this bar and use it for bathing, shampooing, and also in the sink to wash out clothing. Peppermint smell is great, however, I was disappointed it does not last thru the entire bar. Very strong in the beginning, then weakens til almost no smell at all when your at the end. Very gentle even on color treated hair, would recommend to travelers as a all-in-one soap that they can pack without 3-1-1 worries.

This is my favorite soap when it's hot outside.  It has a cool feeling due to the peppermint and I just feel so clean after.  If you have dry or sensitive skin, beware, as this might iritate and/or dry out your skin.  I have found when I use this during the colder months, my skin gets itchy, which is relieved when I use my lotion.  A minor issue is the quantity of soap you get for the price.  It lasts a decent amount of time IF you keep the soap in a dish.

I'm a normal guy with normal skin and grew up using Ivory soap.  We were visiting friends and they had this soap and I really liked the smell and the way it lathered so we bought some.  I've found it last longer than a bar of Ivory and my wife says it doesn't dry her out like Ivory would in the dry winter.  I just like the smell and it gets me clean.

The scent is way weaker than the liquid this was very disappointing dosen't give the tingle I love from peppermint soap

Bit pricey fairly decent but I‚Äôm not crazy about it.Smell: pretty strong at first but fades dramaticallyPrice: too much

I chose to switch to Castille soaps because I'm trying to limit the amount of chemicals soaking into my skin.  I am fond of peppermint, and this soap holds the fragrance nicely until there is only about 1/4 of the bar left.  For some reason the strong peppermint fragrance tends to leave the soap towards the end, although the soap still lathers and performs nicely. Not sure if this is true with all the Dr. Bronner soap fragrances.

This bar soap doesn‚Äôt last very long but is otherwise awesome. I love the peppermint scent and it offers a nice tingly sensation.  Good stuff.

I like the Peppermint smell but this soap sure is expensive. Also it leaves a film which you have to rinse off after showering which is kind of annoying. I like the brand and the strong smell however so I'll live with it.

I wanted a natural soap since I'm tired of exposing myself to a bunch of chemicals. Saw this and decided to try. Smells nice and minty but not too strong. First time I used it, saw what people meant about it burning sensitive areas a bit, but with subsequent uses it happens less and less.Now  love it and the lather and the way it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.

A friend turned me on to this soap a few years ago. I was looking for a more natural soap that would remove my makeup as some of the other products on the market are harsh on my skin, not to mention expensive. This has a great subtle peppermint smell, and lasts a good long time which makes up for the fact that I've found it cheaper elsewhere...and much more expensive!). Great gentle cleanser for my skin. Love it!

I love this soap it work goods  for my sensitive skin and also clean it well. Just a little more than what I pay in the store.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Plenty of peppermint scent, and leaves a nice cooling feeling when done.Just don't get it in your eyes. I can't say it hurts more then other soaps, but it still hurts enough.

Love the smell and with hemp,it helps with some pain. Wish it could be add some moisture.

This is a very nice soap that lathers up very well and makes me feel very clean. My one complaint is that the soap smells a bit funky. I got the peppermint, and while I can definitely smell peppermint, there is an underlying smell that I don't like that takes away from the peppermint. I was hoping for a more pure peppermint smell, but the soap itself works great!

Buy this soap every summer it's refreshing and makes facing those hot humid days a lot easier.  I also think that the peppermint smell works to keep some of the biting insects away, at least that's my opinion.

I love this soap.  Tingly and wakes me up in the shower.  It seems a bit expensive so I dont get it often.

I thought it would be stronger scent

This soap is great for my acne.

This was a decent product

I love the smell it gives off and the cool peppermint breeze in between my legs.

Did not dry out my skin. I recommend.

As a long time user of Dr. Bronner's Lavender soap, I wanted to try a different 'flavor' of his pure-Castile soap. The peppermint soap is great in the shower; it lathers up very easily and the peppermint scent is a real eye-opener.

Smells great

Not as strong as the liquid but still strong

I love this soap, always leaves me refreshed

The Dr. Bronner's soap is excellent!

I love Dr. Bonner's bar soap.  I have ordered it for years and really like all the different scents.

Good classic Dr B peppermint soap‚Ä¶ and it keeps the ticks away. They don‚Äôt like peppermint.

Works well, Smells great

Love how minty and fresh it feels on my body!!

My husband works outdoors and feels like this helps him not get bit by as many bugs

This is my favorite soap! Can‚Äôt wait to purchase again!  I‚Äôm literally on my last bar. I run through this soap fast but it is worth every penny! This soap will have you feeling completely refreshed after a bath. The smell is consuming! Squeaky clean with every single use. You won‚Äôt regret it ‚Äî 10/10.

Love this soap! Makes my skin feel so fresh and clean! I use with a Korean washcloth,  and it really is great for my skin. Recommend!

Love This soap.  I have used this soap since 1968.  It has been great while back packing, as well as at home. Basic.  Does the job, can be used in different ways, liquid as well as solid.

This soap removes dirt and oils from your skin.  I am a mechanic, and Doc Bronners works better than Lava.  This soap also removes plant oils like poison sumac/poison ivy etc.  It gets your skin squeaky clean, which may not agree with some people in cold dry climates.  It is a life saver in humid GA.  Doc Bronners is the only soap I have used for the last 45 years.  I used to use liquid, but I find the bars to be a better value.  I buy lots of bars because it is in every sink in the house.  Better and cheaper than softsoap.

This is just the best bath soap!

i have been using dr bronners products for 5 or more years

You can find these soaps at Target for $5 each. I love everything about them but unfortunately I did not received them from Amazon. They messed up the order. Fortunately found them at Target and was able to buy them for my mom who is bedridden and loves the minty fresh feel on her skin.

Great

This is the best soap bar smells great and is soft and gentle on the skin and soothing to the body.  I love this and bought several more.

I love Dr. Bronners products not only for the value but they really get you clean.  The peppermint gives you an extra fresh feeling.

The product is not full of chemicals.  Old fashioned cleaning product:)

An esthetician friend recommended Dr brothers products when I was having issues with my skin. It is hyper allergenic and is safe to use on my face. Smells great too!

Smells good. Cleans well.

The best

Doesn‚Äôt strip skin oils & dry the skin. Nice scent (peppermint). Long lasting.  The only soap I use.

Lathers nice, fresh clean feeling after rinse.

Dr Bronner's organic/natural soap has been our soap of choice for two years.  Soars above the mass produced brands from big companies.

These are original Dr. Bronner soaps. The 6-pack was well packaged and arrived with no damages. Each soap in it‚Äôs individual paper wrapper.Buying this way saved my about $1/bar compared to my local stores. (Or $6 saved for the bundle.)I will definitely purchase these again.

I enjoy using this brand and scent of soap because it makes my skin soft and the smell opens up my sinuses while in the shower. You really get the value for your money on these soaps.

Great soap you can use on body and hair. More expensive than regular bar soaps but well worth the money

This is the main soap we use in various scents. I also use the liquid Bronner's.

I've been using this soap for a long time and I love it! I love the feel and scent of it. The mint give a slight cooling sensation on my skin that I enjoy. I feel clean and refreshed after using it. I recommend!

I like Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Castile soaps.  They‚Äôre made from plant-based oil, not animal fat like traditional soaps.  They do a great job cleansing the skin without leaving it dry.

Most soaps claim minty freshness, but always fall short like a midget. This soap exceeds all of my expectations!!!I feel like a candy cane after every  shower...No Diddy!!!

I first encountered Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap in a Spa at Calistoga, California - they offered it in their showers after treatment. The smell was so refreshing, I picked some up at the local store, even though I was a little dubious about the packaging. And I've never looked back, although I've been shopping in all sorts of sort of stores looking for more.The great thing about this soap is it's not cologne or perfume, so there's no strange tang, no incense smell, no after taste. It's made from oils - the label says "organic oils" (not sure what "organic" really means but it sounds nice) and it's biodegradable. I love the freshness, and what my nose tells me is the authenticity, of the peppermint.  I've also tried the Lavender and Eucalyptus and like them just as much (I may like the Eucalyptus even more, but the hubs is a little reserved about koala smells).And, although the hubs is really picky about soap, complaining about pine scented holiday soap (I do not care - it's important to enjoy the holidays in every room), non-anti-bacterial soap, overwhelmingly anti-bacterial soap, unscented yet somewhat scented soap soap, and "flakey" soap (not clear how to deal with that), he actually requests this soap. Which says something.I also like the soaps in liquid form - you can use them in the washing machine, to wash dishes, and in the shower (diluted), ensuring that all soap locations in your home smell delightful - and are ecologically conscious.

Recently purchased. Great buy

I initially used this soap at a friend's house and really loved it, so I got myself some. I don't have a very good sense of smell, but I can sense this one, and it also feels fresh on my skin. It's pretty nice!It also makes bubbles well when you rub it in your hands, so its great. Definitely the best soap I've had.

This is an awesome soap that lasts and feels so fresh and clean! It's a great wake-up tool on cold winter mornings, and a relaxing cool-down on hot summer nights.

I love this soap! It lasts a long time, smells great, and is good for your body and the planet.

Liked it all around

Love the lather it produces.  It‚Äôs the best.

Everything went well

Smells great

First of all, I love Dr. Bronner's products and was excited to use this soap for washing dishes. I have used other Dr. Bronner's soaps for washing dished in the past - like the peppermint and they work great. Not his product. As someone who has made soap over the years, it appears that they didn't add enough lye to saponify all of the oil, leaving some oil in the soap. This product may be from a bad batch, but it is the opposite of soap... It's oily and leaves a residue on dishes and hands. It does make some suds, but leaves a residue.

I wanted to love it; it's organic, it's good for your body, people shout from the rooftops of all the uses and ways it can make a difference in their lives... I did not experience this sort of heavenly result.  The label of the bottle was chock full of random religious shouting and kind of put me off.  Yeah, he was a great fella, yeah he went through some terrible ordeal, spreading the good word, great.  But all over my bath soap?  Super weird.  Then, the product itself was RUNNY and did not lather whatsoever.  It actually didn't do much other than turn my bath water into milk.  When you first apply it on your skin, it's silky, but as soon as it's rinsed, you're left with a film on your skin - and in your bathtub!  Even the cup I normally use to rinse was coated in a white film.  Ew.  I made the mistake of using it as a shampoo; OH MY GOODNESS NEVER EVER USE IT AS A SHAMPOO!  It left my hair tangled, limp with the aforementioned film, and I looked like a hot mess.  The only positive I can find is that it smells lovely - but I love Almond anything, so it might be overpowering to some.  It was nice to shave with.  But really, at the end of the day, I just spent like $20 on a giant liquid-y religious-y filmy shave "water"?  No more Dr. Bronner's for me.  And people use this to wash their food?  And their homes?  I can't imagine all the film and residue left behind!!  To each his own...

I have a piece of advice for you. Do not put your scan code label over the directions that say DILUTE ! DILUTE! DILUTE! As you may have guessed I did not dilute this product. I put a lot of it in my hair and while it foamed nicely, when I went to rinse it out my hands literally stuck to my hair and as I was not anticipating this I yanked my head back with it damn near drowning myself.  I rewashed it twice before I got out and brushing was still a nightmare.  The hair close to my scalp stuck like glue to my head and the end of my hair stood straight out so at this point I'm standing in my bathroom looking like the clown from IT just hopped out of the sewer. It's been a week and half and my hair still feels like straw. I'm pretty sure this is just how my hair is now. Soooooooo...Watch where you put your labels.  It smelled nice though.

I've been buying Dr Bronner's for 30 years--and this is the first dud product.  It's disgusting.  I mean the smell but also, apparently, that it isn't really rose, what they used to achieve it.  I got a headache from it--it doesn't leave your skin the way the other Dr Bronner's soaps do--it sticks around.  And stinks.  It really bothered me but I bought 32 oz of it and I hoped I could get used to it and I couldn't believe the culprit was the soap. But it was. Turns out it the fragrance is not actually rose oil.  I looked at my (empty, alas) Lavender Dr B's--uses lavender oil.  Twice bitten, throw it out.  (donate it)UPDATE INFO I GOT FROM DR B's:  The 'fragrance' is not mostly or only rose oil; it includes Geranium, Eucalyptus, Davana, Rose Otto and other oils that have been 'fractionated.'  I dunno what the latter means nor what Davana is (yet) but I now know why I reacted (got a rash, too).  Call me idealistic but in the era of messed-up immune systems, I was surprised they didn't list these.

I received this last week.  Couldn't wait to try it as I want to get away from chemicals and I especially wanted to try it as a shampoo. I have very long curly hair and want it help keep my hair from drying out and not strip it. Well yesterday I used it for the first time. Even while still in the shower it felt weird like my hair was coated in thick wax. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed to no avail. I used the Dr bronner's conditioner and that stunk even worse. I could not detangle my hair. It felt very dry and bushed up so awful. I put a band on it yesterday and tried to brush it out this morning before my shower and could not get a brush through it. I wouldn't use this on anything else for fear it would take paint off. I hate it and would never buy it again. Oh, and it does have a bunch of weird new agey crap on the front, wouldn't care about that but they also used the name of Jesus in it and since I'm Christian, it kinda offended me as the portrayal of Him was inaccurate. I just wish someone would have told me before I spent almost $20 on this crap.

My review is for the NEW LABEL.  The soap inside the bottle is, of course, as wonderful as ever.  I hate the new label.  All the interesting, fun, inspirational, and sometimes wacky sayings and statements from the original Dr. Bronner label are gone.  They are replaced with a label filled with nothing but statements about "fair wages for all workers".  Don't get me wrong, I support fair wages, but I do not want to see it on the label of my soap, especially when it is replacing the beloved traditional label.  Plus, this seems like the wrong group to preach this message to, since I am guessing most people buying Dr. B's soap already support fair wages, so you are preaching to the choir.This was a very poor marketing choice.  The original label was a huge part of the appeal and joy of buying Dr. B's soap.  You made a grave mistake changing it.  BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL LABEL.

I love this brand. Sure, the writing on the bottle is kooky and once you get around to reading it you find that it‚Äôs oddly reminiscent of religious cultish indoctrination. I digress. The soap is so versatile, it more than deserves the definition of ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù- I use it as body wash, shampoo, makeup removal, shaving gel, the works. Never have I known such convenient cleanliness. Worth a 5, perhaps 6 star review, is it not? I would agree, wholeheartedly I assure you. However. A BIG however is the truly awful, pungent, nauseating, puke-like scent of the lavender. Do yourself a favor, friends: don‚Äôt buy the lavender. But any of the other scents, honestly I recommend the Earl Grey, just please, please don‚Äôt buy lavender.

I tried different strengths to no avail. Was afraid to wash my tops leaving an oily residue.Couldn‚Äôt read the directions on the bottle with all that print and coloring. I got on the website and enlarged it. Very frustrating.Through all that print, it does say soft water is recommended. So maybe that‚Äôs why this product isn‚Äôt working for me. IDK.  I‚Äôm really sad about it, Trying to find a product in this category has been quite difficult and pricey.While adding about the soft water recommendation,  I accidentally deleted the picture showing better water spots on plastic.I returned it and didn‚Äôt get a full refund either.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I love the smell of this soap but it dried out my skin. I should have taken baby steps with this instead of using this as a body soap. Even though I use body lotion after every shower my skin would feel terribly dry and I would have to apply lotion a few times a day. The day I switched to a moisturizing bar soap from Dove my skin felt much better.  I tried using this solely as a hand soap after that ordeal and I had to apply lotion after each wash due to the drying effect. So I tried a little test...I washed my hands again with this....Result was dry hands..But immediately washed my hands again with Method hand soap and my hands felt normal again and no need for lotion.Oh, and the dispensers that are "frequently bought together" with this soap, don't work so well. It's like a drunk foaming soap dispenser that spews frothy soap out if you use gentle pressure.

Not until today, have I ever been put off by a Dr. Bronner's soap. Which leads me to believe that this was Not in new and original condition. The seal was barely on, the outside of the bottle was sticky (like someone had tried to wipe it down but didn't to a very good job), it had a funky smell, and the color of the soap did not look normal. From here on out, I'll buy my Dr. Bronner's elsewhere.

I purchased this based off reviews because people were saying it smell so good it‚Äôll keep your man sniffing on you. Well that‚Äôs totally opposite of what this will do. It smells like medicine and my husband said yuk! What‚Äôs that you‚Äôre using? He said he didn‚Äôt like it and neither did I. I bought a huge bottle and I surely won‚Äôt be using this.

Don‚Äôt use this for skin. Youll get scaly skin

Usually, this is a great product but, the product I received this time was an empty dirty bottle, so I will have to give this 0 out of 5 stars

Bottle came broke leaking inside the boxWith the lid broke

I had heard so much about this soap and had to try it.  Unfortunately I purchased the large bottle.  I say Unfortunately because it's complete trash.  Doesn't lather up like traditional soap.  You get that cooling feeling because of the peppermint but it doesn't clean.  People mistake that cooling for cleaning.

No peppermint smell at all.

I don't often write reviews, but I feel like I have to share my experience with this product.  I love this soap, completely adore it and have bought it for years.  When I received it from Amazon today it didn't have a safety seal on it and was very watered down, it had very clearly been tampered with.  So disappointing.  If you love this soap as much as I do, I would recommend buying from somewhere more reliable.  Sorry for the downer of a review!  I hope this review helps someone else avoid this situation...

I've been a fan of Dr Bronner liquid castile soap for years, and now find that they have added palm kernel oil to their product.  Over 80 percent of the fat in palm kernel oil is said to be saturated, and WebM.D. warns about the negative effect of such oil on the health of one's heart.  I will now purchase another brand that contains pure castile soap.  Very disappointing.  Hope they will reverse this decision in the future

I have used Dr Bronner for years. This is absolutely the weakest version i have ever had. I will not be purchasing again, i will go to a brick and mortar to get it.

All 4 containers had their seals off, I could tell because there was reminiscence of the plastic. && all seem diluted slightly already. Disappointed because I like the brand and I can‚Äôt even return.

The cap to the large bottle was broken.

We bought it for our outdoor shower at swimming pool. In a few days my wife developed allergy reaction, it went away when she stopped using it and came back as soon as she tried it again. My skin is more tolerant, but when i use it, i have stingy effect on my skin, but i don't get rush. So we just stopped using it at once... I don't know if it is some butch or it is our skin, but we won't able to use it at all. Other than that it smell as lavender and foamy ....

This was not a good buy. Smelled nothing like it usually does. Very old package. Beware of this private seller!!

I was looking for soap that would work for our gray water system and everyone recommended Dr. Bronners.  All the reviews said that this is the most amazing soap ever.  This stuff is terrible!  Tried using in foam (mixed with water) dispenser for hand washing and also used it to wash dishes.  It leaves this weird film on everything.  Felt like hands were sticky after washing.  Dishes didn't feel like they rinsed clean.  Left a horrible film on my stainless sink.  I don't know how people use this as their miracle cleaning product. Definitely a big mistake.  Prefer the Better Life products .

Left my hair feeling dry and tangled

The larger bottle came with the seal off the top and is a different color than the little bottle with the seal still on. After washing my hands with the soap, I can confirm that this is diluted or mixed with something else and is a scam. Super bummed.

I only received one body wash, it‚Äôs clearly two in the ad

The scent is rose.... but I have no idea what kind of rose this is. I took one smell, put it back in the Amazon box, and took it back to UPS. I‚Äôve heard a lot about this brand, but this smell is NOT GOOD.

This product striped my hair of everything and made it one big rats nest.  When I tried combing it broke my ends, my hair was so dry and brittle after one use.  Don‚Äôt try it.  It smells good and that‚Äôs it.  Use it on your body, not your hair!

I love this product! But I ordered rose and they sent me lavender!

This product leaves my skin dry, itchy, and flaky. I also can‚Äôt even scrub my genitals (bum included!) because if it touches the pink skin, it burns like the dickens! Terrible body wash.

Horrible!  I have very sensitive skin and this is organic and all natural, so I thought I would try it.  Big mistake!  It burns and I now have large red welts from irritation.  I did my homework prior to using also as far as how much to use. Don't make my mistake.  I returned it and will have to buy something else!  It did smell good though so that's a positive.  I'm sticking to G.U.D. or Giovanni I guess.

I was terribly disappointed. This is billed as shampoo, body wash, ..., all purpose cleaner. In all personal hygiene applications, it leaves a soapy film in your hair, hands and body. As an all purpose cleaner, it just doesn't clean very well. I can't imagine using it to brush my teeth.

I'm really surprised with all the good reviews on this product. The scent is just okay and I put it in my soap dispenser and it's as thin as water. The color even looks gross. My daughter asked if I put vegetable oil in the soap dispenser. I hate to be wasteful, but I dumped the whole bottle down the drain and bought a different soap.

This rose soap smells horrid. I should've believed the other reviews saying it smells bad. I love other scents of Dr. castille soaps like lavender, peppermint and almond so I thought I'd try the Rose but it doesn't smell anything like roses or rose essential oil to me. I don't recommend it.

Got this Saturday last, was so excited as the last one was lovely. Poured out about 60mL into my "foaming" bottle with some waterand stepped into the bath.Yecch. Something went horribly wrong in this batch. It smells disgusting, and, not one scent of rose.I tried it directly from the bottle and it is just the same..bad! I am returning this thing somehow.

I bought this along with hemp peppermint , i thought I would like this better than the mint , i do not like this one at all.

The product was water down save your money.

I was charged $20 for a $54 item. I live on a tiny island so must order several products online. I chose this product because it read "free shipping" when in fact, later on, they tacked on $20 for a P.O. box. As a time saver, I order several products at a time so did not notice their little underhanded move. I will look more closely at my final check out in the future but I will never, ever use this company again.

This is NOT the Dr. Bronner's liquid soap that I remember using many years ago. Its consistency is so thin it seems as if it has been watered down considerably. I used it twice and my hair was so dry and brittle, my skin was also dry too. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who bought it way back in the 70's. What a shame.

The initial almond aroma smells great.  I'm very particular about scents, I don't love the post cleaning smell. I purchased specifically for house cleaning. I dislike the water changing to cloudy when I dilute. I feel it's takes a lot of rinsing, leaves residue on surfaces. After cleaning my house it smells like I need to clean my house again. Honestly, I prefer Mrs. Meyers in Basil scent.

My wife told me not to review this tuff but I hate it. It could strip 30 year old wax off a floor. I washed my hands with it, took 5 gallons of water to rinse off. Not friendly to womens privates I was also told.

We have bought several of Dr Bronner's liquid soaps and always  enjoyed them - Not sure what happened with the Rose scented soap, it closer resembles the the smell of flowers in a compost at best. If you're  thinking a bouquet of fresh roses I would suggest to continue looking this product smells down right terrible

I used it once to shower and wash my hair. The consistency is almost like water. After using it I felt decreased and my hair felt like straw. It burned a little in the eyes (not to bad) and I did not like the smell (too strong). I will look for another product that is biodegradable.

Arrived broken with soap leaking into the other items I purchased that happened to be packaged together.  I can't return it because I had to throw it away :(

I am always looking for "aloe free" hand soap.  This one alone clogs up my nice soap dispenser, and i have never had that happen before with any other kind.  It makes it squirt out all over me!

arrived fast....but it is not "ROSE" scented, but hemp rose.  does not smell good.  nowhere in description did it say hemp rose!! even the pic was too small and not able to be zoomed in on to read label. very disappointed in this stinky soap!

Great smelling but left my hair feeling really greasy.  Tried it 4 times, all different amounts of soap; but every time really unhappy with my hair's cleanliness.  Will be returning and won't be buying again.

Extremely watery. Not sure if it was watered down. Was surprised that it got so many good reviews. Mine was probably diluted by half

I usually love Dr. Bronner's castille soap, however, when this bottle of almond-scented soap arrived I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if any of the ingredients can go bad, but it smells rancid and awful.

I love Dr. Bronner's soaps, and have used them for years.  They make my skin feel soft and very clean.  In terms of how this one feels on my skin, it's right up to par.As for the smell ... different story entirely.  When I opened the bottle, first off is a whiff of something ... spoiled.  Like fruit that has gone bad.  But I really WANTED to like it (I needed something to tide me over until they do a Cherry Blossom drop in '25), so I lathered it on.My usual Dr. Bronner's  (peppermint) has a way of filling up the shower with a beautiful minty scent -- part of what makes it so pleasurable to use.  But this thing just smelled like nothing.  Now, a couple of hours after my shower, I can't detect any lingering odor on my skin, or anything, but the whole sensory benefit (half of why you buy a soap in the first place!) is definitely not there.Maybe I'll power through the bottle until it's done, but for sure am not buying this again.  I'll hold out for Cherry Blossom.

This is not for the soap itself but for the price of these bottles.  Have been using the 32 oz for a couple of yrs and like it‚Äôs natural ingredients.  Ran out and went to buy some more and saw the prices went up some, then saw these, 4 for $29, and thought this is a great deal even before inflation. Thought they might be smaller but figured at least 1/2 the size.  Lo and behold when I get them they‚Äôre much tinier, just 8 oz, (1/4 of the size).  You can buy two 32 oz bottles for about the same price.Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of my fault for not making sure they were comparable sizes.  But even if you wanna sample different scents this is a ripoff.  You‚Äôre better off buying full size bottles of each scent, even if one of them is a scent you don‚Äôt like and you discard it.

Definitely could have a better rose smell.

I had the same issue as other reviewers with the terrible cheap cap which arrived in completely useless condition. It‚Äôs really too bad because the soap itself is great but that cap is garbage and I‚Äôm going to have to keep pouring it into another constrainer to actually use it without spilling it everywhere. It‚Äôs not a cheap product- fix the cheap cap!

Not what I expected ! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs suppose to be used in a special dispenser that turns it into foam but it‚Äôs very thin in texture. The first day I used it it comes out very fast and then the first time I used it after I woke up I pressed down on the bottle dispenser and the soap shot up and past me and hit the wall behind me ! Lol ! I‚Äôm like what‚Äôs this ! Squirted it again and swoosh ! Ha Ha Ha Ha ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è right by me again ! So after investigating what‚Äôs going on I noticed at the tip of the dispenser nozzle the soap kind of hardened a little at the end of the dispenser blocking the opening partially causing the soap spraying crazy when dispensed !I‚Äôm not satisfied at all ! I‚Äôm hoping I am missing some special dispenser but I doubt it !

This is not what I was expecting. I was looking for something much stronger for my LOCS other than that it‚Äôs ok for what I paid for it .

This was my first Dr. Bronner merchandise purchase and I was anxious to try it out.  I'm normally a lavender lover, but this product's smell is so overpowering, I can't use it again.  I tried twice, and of course, put 1 part scent with 6 parts water and still can't get used to the smell.  I missed my opportunity window to return the item, so I will see if my neighbor would want it.  It doesn't turn me off of buying Dr. Bronner product again as I feel its versatility and price is pretty good.  As a matter of fact, after writing this, I'm on my way to see if it comes in a lemon scent.  Fingers crossed.

I have used bronners for years. Love the product--for laundry, bathing, hand soap. I bought this off amazon (usually buy in a organic/health food store...) and the product is thinner (watery) and not as strong of scent. I sense it's diluted as the color is off (lighter, not golden like i'm used to.)Buy at your own risk!!!

I really want to like this product; from the description it sounds perfect for my needs. My initial opinion was I liked it, especially the scent. That lasted about 20 seconds until the sweet and pleasant almond fragrance faded into a very unpleasant lingering odor. I'm sorry but I can't get past the bad smell to give this Dr. Bronner's pure castile liquid soup anything but 2 stars. Also, for a concentrate liquid it is very thin.

The rose I received was very drying to my skin.  I tried adding more water but stent foam as well.  I've been used Dr Bronner products for years and first time used the rose. Think i 've used all others but this one. Never again.  I'm a big hand washer and don't need my hands feeling this dry.  Will go back to another used previously.

The cap was broke and it arrived leaking.

Not bad however, it‚Äôs very drying and I don‚Äôt recommend for sensitive skin. Gave me lots of bumps. Using a thick lotion after helped a lot though :)

I have several other 'flavors' of Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap.  I was excited when I saw this one because I had the illusion it would smell like rose water.  It smells like must, dusty roses at best.  I washed my face with it.  My face burned like crazy.  By the next day my skin was red and irritated.  So I read the label and discovered the rose scent is some 'natural rose fragrance'.  I have no idea what that means.  It is my own fault for not checking the label before buying, but other Dr. Bronner's products used essential oils, so I expected the same.  Lesson learned.

Just not what I expected. My skin was so dry and felt rough. I would not recommend this product

Smells like Pepto Bismol nothing like rose. Instead of using as a body wash, it will be used as a cleaning product for bathtub or floors until its done. I will stick to the Almond and Lavender, those actually smell amazing.

You have better options, this one leaves you very dry skin, i would not recomend you buy this, better buy the peppermint one.  I Takes all the natural Oil and leaves you really dry. I would use the soap for something else, not for the shower anymore.

Upon arrival, the package had been ripped open, and the 2oz travel bottle was missing.

The soap is great, but the smell is awful, in my opinion. I thought rose would be a light, flowery scent- and this is very strong, artificial, chemically sweet smell. It is not good! I wish I would have gone to the co-op and taken a whiff before buying this. My advice is smell it before buying it! I will probably use the bottle (not to waste!)  but with reluctance. I am talking about the ROSE scent. I love others like the peppermint and lavender.

Hardly smells like anything, let alone rose... & I dont have COVID, so I can smell. Does not have the tingly clean feeling other scents of Dr. Bronner‚Äôs have.

I didn't receive the small bottle.  Where is it?

It smells great and gives a clean feeling but really dries out my skin. I would say stick to using in summer if you do buy it.

I love dr bronners, but the cap was completely smashed in transit.

When I used the soap with baking soda and vinegar for laundry, as recommended by the Dr. Bronner's people themselves, and the smell that came from that combo left my clothes smelling like old baby spit-up or dirty diapers.  It was surprisingly foul.  And it wasn't something that could be aired out of them--I had to rewash the clothes in another detergent.  Disappointing.

This is nothing more than a big bottle of liquid soap. You are better off at the dollar store. I tried as a shampoo and it left my hair dull and dry...even though I diluted it a lot. I tried cleaning with it but it didn't do an adequate job. I tried it as a body wash but again it left my skin dry. I have now resorted to using it for dog shampoo! would not recommend

The seller did a good job and it arrived on time. This was the first time of using this soap and it leaves your skin very dry after using it

I received a bottle with no tap . Just sealed

It may work well for household cleaning, but I bought it to use in the shower. It leaves my skin extremely dry and itchy. I tried it one time on my hair and it was a tangled mess, and I have thin hair.

I ordered a lavender bottle and got an unscented with the label that says lavender.

Leaves dishes streaky and greasy, as shampoo doesn't suds enough and hair feel oily very fast. Not at all as advertised. Smells nice though.

I love Dr. Bronner's and I LOVE rose 98% of the time, so I thought I would love this scent. But it doesn't smell like Rose... I don't like it at all. My favorites are peppermint and almond!

Makes my skin dry.

Rose scented perfumes, soaps, and lotions are my thing so I was very excited to find out that Dr. Bronner's Castile Liquid Soap came in Rose scent. I was not expecting this scent at all. In fact, I don't even think it resembles any kind of rose scent! I mainly just use it in the kitchen.

Love the product but it arrived with a cracked lid and the soap had saturated the packaging.

Smells like articifal rose perfume. I buy dr bronner's because it supposed to be more natural; very disappointed. Skip this scent and instead buy  the lavender, tea tree or unscented castille soap.

I thought it was more of the lavender scent it does not have a very nice scent at all. Smells like medical soap.

I love the smell of this product, and how the ingredients are all natural, but the soap is rumny, clumsy to use and leaves my skin feeling uncomfortable. It's also very expensive.

The bottle leaked in the box

If I use this product in a bath soak more than once in a row I get itchy skin.  So does my daughter. In fact, she gets a reaction after using just once. We're both fair skinned red heads.  It's too expensive to use for general cleaning. (It does keep the bathtub clean) It may be a great product for some people.  Just not me.

Arrived damaged not even sure how I‚Äôm supposed to return

this is ok for hands it totally dried my skin out and don't use it for hair it will come out like paste on your hair

Doesn't smell like other almond Dr. Bronner's that I have bought.

Should have stuck with their peppermint scent one. This smells too strong.

The original is better than the almond scent

Smelled great, but I must be allergic because it burned my skin. My forehead scabbed and everything!

I was not thrilled with this product.  I figured rose fragrance how bad could it be?!?  It was bad, It was not what I expected.  I love Dr. Bronners Almond and Peppermint castile soap, but buyers be where this smells horrible!

Not a fan of the almond. Irritated my face.

Love Dr Bronner's soaps, but the rose scent smells like baby puke to me.

I prefer peppermint

Safety seal was loose, soap more watery than the bronners I buy in stores.

Doesn't feel quite as cleansing as the peppermint version

Don‚Äôt want to return a broken bottle, but it was leaking through the container it was shipped in. Had to have happened recently. Box was not damaged itself. Excited to try it, but wish cap wasn‚Äôt busted.

I love the soap and the smell, but I am really mad that I did not receive the 2oz travel bottle as listed in the bundle. It‚Äôs a bummer cause I wanted it for my flight. Might change my rating if I can get what I paid for.

I like the product the only reason why I bought it was because I used it once at a friend house and absolutely loved it. But I don‚Äôt appreciate not getting everything that I paid for.

I love the scent and feel, but I bought this so I‚Äôd have the big bottle for home use and the small bottle for travel but they only sent me the big bottle.

This soap works as well as all the other of course but the Rose smell is off a bit and frankly just overpowering. If you are looking to get this scent, might be a good idea to get the bar soap to try out before buying a liter. That said, the citrus and almond scents are great, would definitely recommend.

I took this backcountry camping where I needed something all-purpose and bio-degradable.  It worked well as dish soap, and bath soap but awful as shampoo.  I hadn't brought any conditioner and I was unable to comb out my hair.  Until I got back to civilization, and was able to rewash with conditioner, my hair just had to look like Medusa's snakes.  I went 5 days without combing my hair.  The smell starts out nice but it has a bad after-smell.  I wouldn't order the almond again.  And if I take it camping again I'm bringing conditioner - even if it has to be leave-in conditioner if I can't find something biodegradable.

Wish I was as thrilled with these products as everyone else, I had lots of hope, but just not impressed.  Will continue to use my essential oil DIY mixtures.  There is something in these soaps that leaves a horrid residue.  Even when mixed as directed for hand soap at my work place (I work in a clinic), the stainless steel sink where all the nurses and providers uses this has residue stains all over the sink and surrounding area!!!  My skin feels waxy and not clean at all after use.  Will not purchase again.  Smells good, but other than that..... yuck!

I wouldn‚Äôt have bought if I read more clearly there was hemp in it. Nothing wrong with hemp, I just probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten it. This product is extremely drying on the skin. Not a huge fan at all. Won‚Äôt be buying again. The original Dr Bronners is the only one I‚Äôve liked so far.

I like Bronner's soaps.  This is the first time I bought the orange citrus. I love orange smell so I was a little disapponted to find that this has very slight orange scent (unlike bbw's Satsuma).  I also was disappointed in the lather capability in this soap as compared to their Peppermint soap.  I also thought the soap was less viscous than their Peppermint and Almond soaps which contributes to overuse when you combine that with two children( get the picture).  So overall I am satisfied with the cleanliness it gives me but as compared to their other products I give it an OK.  Would I buy it again?  Yes I would, when my children are grown and/or if I could dole out what amount is given to them (lol).

Great smell. Still trying to figure out the best method for using this particular scent/product.  Was not very effective as a cleaning agent on my wood floors nor kitchen and bathroom tiles.  Left streaks and a haze on all floor textures.  This caused me to do a follow up buffering...not what I want to have to do--a third round following sweeping then mopping.As far as in the bath:  great smell even though I can't figure out the right formulation for using with my children who also love the smell.  Tried to dilute with water for their bath soap, but found a 2 to 1 soap-water mix more effective.  Does not create bubble bath effect so I find it wasteful to simply add into their bath water.

3 stars because I never received the smaller bottle. Besides that all is good.

I like the brand and what they represent, the product smells good, but for use on hair strips back all the natural oil in the hair leaving it very very tangly and dry. better as soap, still very strong.

Damaged bottle top:Product arrived with a broken white top that did not over the entire top or the bottle, and a puncture whole was in the foil that was on the actual bottle.  I won't return, it is too much trouble.

I love Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps but this one smells too much like candy for me. I use the soap for laundry and it was a bit much. I think it would be great for a hand soap though! If you like sweet smelling soap, you'd love this. To be clear, it smells delicious... just not for the purpose that I had in mind.

Used to buy this all the time‚Ä¶don‚Äôt remember it being so liquid.  And the scent has faded too.

Stronger than the peppermint variety, beware. Very effective, and a pleasant aroma. May leave residue on the skin which "tastes bad" easily. One thing that darkened it is the old school "cleanliness is next to godliness" neutral  contentHas been replaced with Anti-GMO legal propaganda, admittedly a interest for the,, but i tend to find it comparatively annoying and might not buy this variety again(considering), almost stronger than i care for, might try the other scents first.(so far only done peppermint and this).

I've got other scents of this soap (tea tree and citrus) which are very good, but this one has barely any scent at all. I was very disappointed since I love rose and flowery scents, but this one was barely perceptible!  I'm sending it back.

Love the product but HATE the scent! I usually get the lavender version but decided to try rose and let me tell you I have never hated a soap as I hate this one.The scent is of overly sweet, fake roses.Only used it a few time and then got rid of it.Sticking to lavender next time

It‚Äôs watery, don‚Äôt too much like that. The scent is great. I only bought it bc I would see a lot of people hyping it up. Way over hyped.

I love dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint soap, but I did not receive the 2oz bottle for this bundle.

Less fragrant than I had hoped and it seems thinner than this brand's tea tree soap. I love the brand, love they are a family business, and love that they keep other brands accountable to the organic label. I hate that California threatened to sue them for "prescribing" just because the Bronners had printed proven benefits on a product label. Only licensed pharmaceutical companies are allowed that freedom of speech.

Too much residue even after a week of use every 2 or 3 days. Works for my man's coarser hair though. I use it for laundry but am disappointed it comes out of the washer nice n pungent but out of the dryer with no scent at all. Just not what I expected but not terrible. Havent used it to clean yet, feels too residue-y to use on dishes but may try it.

My skin feels great, but the rose scent didn't come through.. it actually has a sweet bubble gum smell. Oh and my bottle came with the lid cracked, which spilled into my entire order... but this has not factored into my rating at all, just thought I'd mention it

Last bottle of Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap-Almond, was very week & odd smelling.  The almond smell was almost non existent.  Have used this soap for years & this one was different!  Almost not good.

I purchased this as a gentler product for my foaming soap bottles. Mixing with water allows for a perfect foam soap refill. However it was too harsh for my hands. I have used the baby version in the past but wanted something with a better smell. This doesn't really offer a peasant smell.

I've been using Dr Bonner's for over 40 years. When my last bottle runs out, I'm done. This soap dries my skin out badly. My young skin loved it, but my old skin needs something more nourishing.

Don't get rose scent. It took me until the final drops of this bottle to be ok with the "rose" scent. But, hey, you can't bash too hard on a company like Doctor Broners. Their ethical, use sustainably and fairly sourced all natural and organic products. Just buy any scent but rose

Bonners quality, but it doesn‚Äôt smell of roses

While I love the way the soap makes my skin feel... I can‚Äôt stand the smell. I know this sounds crazy but initially it smelled like almonds but now all I smell is maraschino cherry!

Love these products but disappointed with the scent. The only time I smell the almond is in the bottle and while it's sudsing. Smell goes away right when you wash it off. Sad :(

I ordered this for myself and didn‚Äôt like it. I was going to return it but my husband tried it and loved it.

I really love these soaps, but this one smelled like throw up, i hope it wasn't because it was old or anything but I didn't like the smell. my friends liked the smell but i know Rose smells tend to either  smell like throw up or actually smell sweet.

dr bonners is great soap. you can use it for so many different things, and it's castile soap and organic so you know it's quality. it soaps up real good but if you wash your hair with it you'll catch random wiffs of a weird "rose" and hair mix that's just kind of not sexy in my book.stick with the peppermint or citrus, those scents are premium.

Great but causes more build up in bath than other liquid soaps I have used.

Love the Smell. Product was so watery you lose most of it when trying to get on your hand, or body brush. And they actually tell you to add water?

Love Dr Bronner's, but the rose scent is not for me. I wanted to like it, but it just isn't my scent. I also have Tea Tree and Lavender and I love them both.

I clearly ordered rose castile soap and somehow ended up with eucalyptus. Not a happy camper because I wanted what I paid for. Fortunately for me this is a good soap brand.

This may work fine for other purposes.I bought for use in the tub. It caused discomfort  and didn‚Äôt bubble.

Seems to be diluted down than in the past  and can‚Äôt really smell the lavender!

It feels a little residuey on my skin after, but doesn't dry it out. Arrived with the smaller bottle leaked all over, but unbroken.

Works well as soap but smells nothing like roses.  In fact , I find all Dr Bronner's soaps have  not a particularly unpleasant smell but a strange one.

I love the lack of toxic chemicals in this soap, and it has great slip and good suds. The scent isn't as rosy as I'd like. I'm not sure if the hemp overwhelms the rose or what. It'd probably be a good idea to include the word hemp in the product title, since it does have a pretty strong smell.

Very odd Lavender scent. Not a real good scent.

I've used this soap for years and all of a sudden it's become prohibitively expensive. Last month this 32 oz size was $48! For soap! I've tried all the comparable others and the best one is Dr. Natural at about $10 for a 32 oz sizehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H630G7U?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsDon't bother paying this kind of money anymore!!

I love Dr Bronners, and this scent is fabulous and refreshing for bathing.  But maybe getting it online is a bad idea. It arrived with a crack in the bottle, and while I was able to salvage about 90% of the product, it was a giant mess.

It‚Äôs okay. I prefer the peppermint and tea tree scents. The smell was just TOO much for me. Very sweet but annoyingly sweet if that makes sense.

Like the product but felt like the lavender didn‚Äôt have any smell

My husband and I are split on this. He likes the tingling sensation on his face and is OK with the scent. It goes beyond tingling into a stinging on mine and I find the scent very unpleasant.

The rose smell is not from rose oil. It smells kind of weird. But the cleaning function is the same.I would recommend the tea tree version.

Smells right, looks right but it's a lot thinner than I remember. It feels like the soap has been diluted

I wish I had gotten the peppermints because I think it has a smell that you can identify. It works just fine but with bath products I really really enjoy if they smell like something I like and can identify. I even added a little eucalyptus oil, but it didn‚Äôt do anything. I would suggest sticking with the peppermint if you know you like the smell or another one if you know it smells like something because this is just a big bottle of generic smelling soap that is good soap. It‚Äôs not sensory enhancing.

Maybe not so good for your private parts.

Product came well packaged and as advertised. Not sure if we will be able to use it for the intended purpose (laundry) because the peppermint oil is SUPER strong in this. We will find something for it!

Products were packaged securely and the sizes were not bad for the price. I did not try any of them as yet but, I am sure they will do a good job base on the ingredients they are made with.

We use this for laundry, hand-washing, mopping & body washing. It is a wonderful product that cleans & suds very well. I don‚Äôt have to add essential oil with this although with the vinegar, for the fabric softener I do.

I purchased this product to help save money on cleaning supplies. I'm not a "green" freak and don't care as much as some about chemicals in my cleaners. This item has taken the place of almost all my other cleaners! So far I've made multi purpose cleaner, shave cream, glass cleaner and a bunch of other things. Who knew it could do so much and make my cleaning cabinet so much more spacious! I am now trying out as a "no poo" shampoo. If I can use such a small amount to wash my hair and body then I'm in. I can't believe how much money can be saved by going green. Green cleaning supplies are quite expensive, but you can save a ton by using Castile soap with some other cheap products to make your own.The only reason I gave this item four stars is the smell. I'm starting to get used to it, but wish I would have gotten fragrance free and added my own scent with essential oils. I will do that next time. You can add other scents to this, but the almond smell is always there in the background and pretty strong on its own.A few tips for using this product:Do NOT mix with vinegar, it will destroy the oils in this product, many Pinterest pins give recipes that mix vinegar and Castile soap, don't do it! This is not recommended for use on hair due to it being so high alkaline, can be mixed with honey and lemon juice to make a bit more acidic, what your hair needs, and lastly...a little goes a very long way! No need to use concentrated, mix with lots of water, same cleaning power with less waste and your bottle will last a very long time.I've only made a small dent in this bottle after make 3 gallons of all purpose cleaner, 32oz bottle of concentrate hard wood floor cleaner, 32oz bottle concentrate carpet cleaner, 3-16 oz shampoo/body wash bottles (no poo shampoo), 1 gallon shave cream (will last DH and I at least a year!) and several other cleaners I can't think of off the top of head right now.I will be getting another bottle of the baby kind next time so I can add whichever scent I want without having the almond smell lingering in the background, or forground without adding a ton of essential oils! For cleaning the scent isn't really an issue, but it's not the greatest for body care.

I absolutely love Dr bronner's that's the only soap I will use especially after learning all the toxic chemicals that are in all the products we use on a daily basis!!! I loved all of these except the almond one it just wasn't appealing to me my only issue is I wish they were bigger bottles.... I know there's bigger ones on here I was just stating that for this specific order!! but the peppermint is awesome it makes you feel cool and refreshed and slightly tingly lol

Having used bar soap for my whole life and upon having learned bar soap can cause mold growth easier than liquid soap, I set out and bought Dr. Bronner's. Price for volume, it comes out much cheaper than most soaps and similar to what other reviewers have said, you really don't have to use much at all in order to lather up a storm, so this bottle should last me for at least a couple months.As far as quality of the product, the smell is pleasing (at least for me) but is a much more muted lavender than most other lavender smells, even more so after finishing showering and drying off. I have noticed immediately after rinsing, unlike other soaps I've used, there is a somewhat sticky or rubbery feeling on my skin which slightly irks me but the sensation fades quickly.Even though I bought this to be used as a body soap, I got curious about all the 18 uses it claims it has and did some searching. Turns out it can be used to wash clothes, floors, or even to wash your teeth (though I haven't brought myself to try it in that regard yet).I'm extremely happy with this purchase and definitely will be buying more when it runs out. The only gripe I have is the slight rubbery feeling right after I rinse it off.

Love it but not pleased with the fact the cap came cracked.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Shipping could be better

I love the scent of almond.  This soap has a very nice scent of the almond notes to it.  It is not too overpowering.....just right.  I do have to say that I DO NOT find that this soap needs to be diluted at all.  It does NOT have a thick consistency.  Matter of fact, it's more on the watery side.  I diluted this soap and found that it loses everything I liked about this soap when I first opened the bottle.  So personally, I don't see why it tells you to dilute this formula.  I suppose if you want a weaker soap, that is up to the individual.  I will use less soap on a wash rag or when I wash my hands, but I find that I DO NOT have to dilute this brand. I would definitely purchase the almond scent again.  I have other Dr. Bonner's soap.  I have a huge, huge bottle of the peppermint scent which will  probably last me a life time. It is wonderful also.

I liked the variety but I had a reaction to half of them. Skin got red and irritated. Please take care to try on a small part of your body first. Just because one kind is okay, doesn‚Äôt mean they all are. I just stick to the lavender from now on. My experience is probably not typical.

I‚Äôm so glad I got this variety - smells amazing - just like almond crescent cookies :) Leaves my skin clean and does not strip moisture whatsoever. The bottle is large and only a small bit needed. I‚Äôve used just by pouring a bit in my wet hand and it creates a creamy lather. I‚Äôve also used by putting a bit in a loofah and got a great foamy lather that I wasn‚Äôt expecting. I used on my toddlers skin - she has eczema and I‚Äôve tried every product out there (dove aveeno cetaphil etc) to no avail. This caused no reaction and actually calmed her bumps a bit. I singed a star because it says can be used for shaving. However, I‚Äôve found that since it leaves the skin ‚Äúsqueaky clean‚Äù that causes a bit of tugging while trying to shave so I don‚Äôt recommend for that. I‚Äôve only used this as a body wash so can‚Äôt attest to household cleaning, face wash or shampoo claims.

If clothes very dirty of course need more soap.  I wash on cool wash - this is added to baking soda & powder laundry booster(1 cup of each per average load), and if too much powder, the powder may not dissolve, so sometimes add a liquid booster.  Making own laundry detergent saves lots of money.

I love the scent, and I really wanted to love everything else about this soap, but it's just not to be. We don't necessarily have hard water, but it's not as soft as it could be, which means that Dr. Bronners soap leaves a film. On skin, hair, the sink, dishes. Speaking of dishes, this soap didn't cut through oil or grease, even when used full strength, so I definitely won't buy it until the water is softer.

I have joined the Castile club!  This soap is amazing.  I use it as a hand soap and for dishes sometimes.  I noted it cuts through grease better than the dish detergent I am using.  This is saving me money.I have noted an issue with the scent which may be attributed to the water to soap ratio I used or maybe I did not mix the bottle well.  It can smell like used frying grease sometimes (No, really, a fried food odor.  I assure you I was not hungry at the time).  I have not noted this lately since I make sure to mix well.  I will try another scent though, peppermint most likely, to verify whether this issue is inherent to the almond variety.

Love the brand! My face is very prone to breakouts, and since I've been using Dr. Bronner's (plus safflower oil, tea tree oil, and water) in a foaming pump, my skin has never been so consistently healthy and I actually look forward to washing my face. I fell in love with the citrus smell, but decided to branch out and try the almond.I subtracted one star partially because of the steep price, and partially because the almond smell is a little too aggressively sweet for my tastes. It's certainly not a bad smell, but it smells like I'm rubbing amaretto syrup on my face. It's just really strong. Then again, I am using it on my face, so if you're not using it right next to your nose, it's probably fine.

I love dr.bronners, it‚Äôs an amazing product that can be used for so many purposes! However not happy that product came damaged. They fit it in such a tight tiny box that the cap was smashed

I am a big fan of natural products with fewer ingredients and saving money of course. This product is great for making your own hand soap (a little goes a long way) and I‚Äôve even used it for dishes and laundry soap. Hand soap is my favorite. It‚Äôs easy to find recipes for your own products using castle soap and the liquid form is super easy to use.  And I prefer this lavender scent to the unscented one I bought last time. It‚Äôs nice to notHave to add oils to the soap to make the scent. Lavender is my favorite and this has a great strong smell. Totally worth it for natural products and it smells and works wonderfully.

This soap is completely unlike the hand soap I've bought in the past and really gets you clean, but it can and will gum up standard soap dispensers with results that will either be hilarious or frustrating depending on your mood and how many spare shirts you have.

I love the scent and how it makes my skin and hair feel! The only thing I wish were different is all the words on the label would‚Äôve been easier to read if they were in an accordion style insert that was glued or taped to the bottle. As it is, the words are hard to read because they‚Äôre all smashed on the bottle.

My mom uses this soap for almost everything from household cleaning to body soap.  I use it because I try to stay away from all the chemicals found in other cleansing products. Currently, I mix this with some tea tree essential oil in a bottle for a very cleansing body wash that helps clear up slight acne and gives a very refreshing scent.  I have also used this in the wash machine for some of my more delicate cycles (like expensive jeans) because it is very gentle on fabric and does not fade the color as much.  If you read other reviews, you'll see that people use it for a whole hosts of things. The only reason I took a star off is because the almond scent is a little weak, although pleasant.

I normally use the Dr. Bronner Mint, but thought I'd switch things up and get the rose scent.  I thought I knew what roses smell like, right?  This doesn't smell like roses at all.  I have a pretty good sense of smell too.  I don't detect roses.  It smells like beer to me.  If you've tried a Blue Moon or citrus beer, that's kinda what it smells like.  I still gave it four stars anyway because the scent is not bad, and the soap is great.  I feel so clean afterwards and my skin doesn't feel dry.

Currently used for hand soap with water to dilute. Haven‚Äôt tried for other uses besides hand soap yet...Update I still have about less than a 1/4 left since Mar, it‚Äôs Aug now. I work in a hot warehouse. This cleans my hair and skin all while rinsing away leaving no residue. I prefer this to the moisturizing body washes while it‚Äôs hot. I haven‚Äôt tried to for the many other uses it listed. It does strip your hair color away some. But if you have oily hair or skin this works wonders. And it made my curls pop!

I like this soap for daily washing. Ypu do have to use extra as doesnt go along way with a luffa.

Love it although it will dry your skin.

As usual Dr. Bronners leaves us squeaky clean. The almond smell is a little nutty n not quite as expected but since it‚Äôs not overwhelming - no issues. Although I know the benefits of Dr. Bronners, it‚Äôs unfortunate that these burn the eyes and sensitive areas for kids. I love using them for their ingredients but it‚Äôs a screaming match while bathing kids if they have some bruises or if they get into the eyes. Regardless I will stick by these since they do such a thorough job of cleaning without loading major chemicals.

Not crazy about the smell, but I've gotten used to it over time. It's not strong and it doesn't bother me. I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it does a good job. The oils in it also help soften the bristles. I have some natural hair brushes that became scratchy with other cleaners. They are soft again after using this product. It's a good value for the amount that you get. The price here was much better than at my local Walgreens. I am happy with my purchase. I would buy it again and recommend it.

I really wanted to be one of those people who loved Castile soap and used it for everything under the sun. I'm not there yet... I've used it for a few things and it's done an okay job. But it isn't so amazing that I would replace my other cleaners w it. I do like that it's not harsh on my skin while I used it (but I use organic cleaners now so I don't have that issue). I'd likely keep a bottle on hand, but  don't swear by it... yet. I still have hope!

Can be more reasonable or affordable but still my favorite natural soap

Great product, looking forward to trying a few more.

So, I really, really love this soap.  I use it for everything.  The peppermint, eucalyptus, and almond scents are my favorites.  I tried the rose scented one, though, (and I LOVE rose scent!), and it's awful.  They did to the smell of roses what cough syrup and lozenges have done to cherry.  I wouldn't recommend it... I didn't want to waste it so I'm using it for my laundry and it works fine.  But the others, yes, definitely, good stuff.

This is great, I prefer the peppermint though because it gives that tingly clean feeling if you know what I mean. I thought that would be in all Dr. B soaps, but seems like this one is lacking it. I like the smell alright, it's very sweet and clean. It does just as good a job getting things clean from what I can tell, but I'll be getting a different flavor next time.

It's a 2 in 1shampoo and conditioner. Very good with people with nature hair or even locs.  Makes ur hair soft and durable

I love the smell and that it‚Äôs all natural! Works great for me and didn‚Äôt irritate my toddlers skin when I gave them a bubble bath in it HOWEVER I won‚Äôt use it on my kids again because the bath water with it in it irritated their eyes even when diluted.

I‚Äôm a big fan of Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Castile soap.  Been using it for years.  Lately I‚Äôve been trying out the different scents that Dr. Bronner‚Äôs offers and I‚Äôve enjoyed most of them so far.  This one isn‚Äôt my favorite though.  The smell is nice, but it‚Äôs heavy.  It‚Äôs too much.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting it again.

I‚Äôve been through so many bottles of this but I‚Äôve noticed how extremely drying it is. Strips away all your body oils and I‚Äôm just not into that (unless you moisture ALOT afterwards!!). However, will use it for another purpose, just not as a body wash

This is my first time purchasing this rose soap. I love Dr. Bronner's liquid Castile soaps. I was very excited when I saw rose. It turns out, though, that this is not my favorite scent. Definitely not a fake perfumey rose scent. And not a sweet scent. I will definitely buy Dr. Bronner's Castile soap, but I'll stick to my favorites: almond, peppermint and lavender (in that order).

I was using soft soap and it made my hands so dry I couldn't stand it so I decided to try to make my own using this soap. I like it a lot no although would probably try a different scent next time. Unfortunately my husband doesn't like it!

This liquid soap is great. Smells fresh and cleans very well. The only issue is that its too watery, and when you come to get it out of the dispenser, it splashes everywhere. I wish they would make it a thicker substance. Thanks.

I've used this for a decade for everything -- washing hands, clothes, body. However I stopped using it for body about a year ago because it severely dries out my significant other's skin, and I've recently found it very astringent on mine. Not sure if the formula slightly changed, or maybe our own skin did (haha), but we've switched to a more lubricating body wash instead.

I like this brand of soap because it does not leave a film on my skin.

I used this product to make a DIY shampoo so I added other ingredients to it. It lathers a lot so a little goes a long way. Haven't tried it on its own to do anything as yet but great product thus far...

I bought the lavender scent, but I don't smell any lavender - it smell more like soap than anything .I do like that it's natural and will use it up and try another scent, or go for the original. Overall I am happy.

Awesome soap just not a huge fan of the smell.

Smells good and feels so fresh on body.

My son only uses Dr. Bronner's Soap for his body, hair and beard! He has used all scents and said the Rose was a little more feminine than he likes (I tried to tell him...lol). As far as the quality, he swears by this soap. Will definitely be purchasing more.

Awesomeness Product

I'm new to Castile soap.  I'm not sure it lives up to the hype but I'll keep trying.  I'm a little tired of the Almond smell.  I use almond oil for moisturizer so that surprises me.  I also bought the unscented, so when and if this bottle EVER runs out, I'll probably add essential oil to that and love it.

Preferred straight almond without the hemp.

I was looking for a body wash that was not owned by a mega corporation and I came across this brand.I was intrigued that one product could have so many uses, but I got this product with the intention to use it as bodywash.The first scent I got from Dr. Bronner's was Lavender, and let me tell you, it smelled awful! I thought "maybe this product isn't for me?", but I decided to give it one more chance and I'm so glad I did!The second scent I ordered was Rose, and this one smelled amazing! Now, it's my new go-to.The lather on this is top notch. The product is concentrated, so you can get away with using small amounts but still creating a bubbly lather.The cleaning power is great. Skin feels squeaky clean WITHOUT it feeling dry or stripped.In fact, I think this works a bit too well? Because I use self tanner, and this product washes my fake tan off in a week! (Prior to using this product, I could get away with doing a fake tan every 2 weeks, but I guess this product is doing a superb job at getting rid of dead skin cells).I LOVE that this company is vegan, cruelty-free, organic, and fair traded- It's a brand you feel good about supporting.My only concern is that this soap is pretty much made up of several organic oils, which may be a concern going down the bath drain? We are told that oils can clog drains and this product is only composed of oils.

A couple of drops goes a long way, but rinses clean with ease. The peppermint scent is so invigorating! The large vottle lasts for months and the small bottle is easy to refil and take traveling. Perfect.

I have been using this product for over 25 years. You can wash your entire body from your from your toes to your hair and that‚Äôs what I use this for with excellent results. This is the product for me and it smells good.

I discovered it when I visited my daughter, and she has great taste and can afford any soap money can buy (so cost not an issue here). I love that it is light, concentrated, deep cleansing, lovely smelling, and leaves my skin thoroughly clean with no grime anywhere after I towel myself. I always apply an intensive moisturizing lotion (Nivea 48h for dry skin) after that; it is a perfect combination. My wife has noted that my skin is smoother than ever recently (but shhhh that's my secret).  I would feel like fish out of water if I run out so I always order when my last bottle is about half finished...In case anyone is thinking I was paid to write this - I wan't. I read some of the negative reviews which I found inaccurate and I felt obliged to speak up...

I've been using Dr. Bronner's liquid soap since 1973, when my college roommate turned me on to it. Started with peppermint of course, then later almond, eucalyptus, and finally lavender. It has kept me clean of body and mind (well, no, not really of mind) for the past half-century. It's mild but incredibly effective, with no harsh chemicals, weird ingredients, or irritants. I have tried it (diluted) as a mouthwash (effective, but YUCK, it's soap!), and it even works on squeaky hinges. The peppermint is truly rejuvenating, and lovely in a warm water foot soak. Lavender is actually a very calming scent, good for an evening bath or shower. There are other flavor, my spouse likes rose, and there's even an unscented version. Dr. Bronner's is an Essene rabbi's crowning achievement-- true cleanliness that puts you on a path to godliness!

WOW  this is the BEST soap I have ever used! It really cleans you ! But you really need to use it sparringly,  a little goes a long way.  So refreshing!

Subtle and nice scent. I use this as my evening routine, and always feel clean afterwards. Make sure to dilute or it will dry out your skin.

I use this with my body wash  about a half dollar amount, and it leaves meSqueaky clean! Just remember to NEVER use alone or u will burn ur precious parts..

Love this soap! Truly so clean and simple. No additives, just purse Castile soap with essential oils.

Always reliably good liquid soap‚Ä¶been using it for years with positive results and no complaints

Give it a try you will love it. Makes you feel clean and without all those chemicals in other soaps. Been using it for a few years and will never use those mass market soaps.

Whatever you do, DO NOT squeeze a lot out. About a U.S. quarter size amount of soap with lather a loofah or a regular size rag completely.Talk about squeaky clean. Using this thing you get the feeling that you haven‚Äôt been bathing properly for your whole life, because for the first time you actually feel squeaky clean. It is a very weird and disconcerting sensation feeling like you haven‚Äôt really bathed all your life till just now, but you‚Äôll get used to it, and then you‚Äôll love it, and then you‚Äôll buy more just like I did. I think this is bottle number eight and there will be many more because I plan to try every flavor they have.

Love it. Been using it for years. Great value.

Lather up real good will get you very clean. Smells good need moisturizer afterwards or some type of a lotion for your skin.

I love this soap. The only one I use and feel really clean. üßº

this is my favorite sope been using for years.. my wife loves it also

I've used this from everything from cleaning dishes to my hands to once the floor. Just need to dilute to your preference

I love the variety.  I use it once a week

The fragrance is great, lathers well.we feel clean after using the soap.our washcloths rinse with no or very little soap left in them. It s so ‚Äúearth friendly ‚Äú that a winery we belong to uses it to wash their equipment.

Excellent product, I developed dandruff and this takes  care of itchy scalp.Beware of it getting in your eyes, it burns for a couple hours even as you rinse your eyes out in the shower.

This soap is the very best... it cleans well yet is gentle and not harsh. I use this as part of my bathroom spray, for my delicate handwash only items including hand knitted and crocheted projects; works great for sponge baths the mobility challenged as it doesn't leave a residue, and is great for many other uses.

I use this for a lot of different things but it is not a good shampoo.

I LOVE Dr. Bronner‚Äôs soaps but my all time favorite is the almond. Very mild and the scent is slightly sweet. My whole family uses this, we‚Äôve even used it in the garden. Dr. Bronner‚Äôs is so versatile. Love it

This Castile soap is really a jack of all trades (and master of them all). It's a great body wash, hair wash, fine fabric laundry soap, to name just a few of its uses. AND it's concentrated so a little goes a long way.

I can feel all the tingles and it‚Äôs so refreshing and rejuvenating. Honestly a mini spa every shower. Worth the price! The peppermint is strong but my favorite scent!

I use this for my body soap as well as my clothes soap. Pure and toxin free. I love the smell of lavender. They make a non-scented one also.

We use nothing else!

Use instead of harsh chemicals

I love the fragrance of this soap!  It  lathers up nicely, too.

Smells good, cleans well. My son uses as a dog shampoo. Chloe‚Äôs coat is smooth and shiny.

it's perfect. I love it. I'm not a robot, this is a real person reviewing this

Love this scent wish it was cheaper

Works well and smells great.

Needed to make a solution to keep bees from borrowing into our wood deck

I dilute one part Dr. Bronner's soap with four parts water and pour that into a foaming soap dispenser (they have many different kinds for sale on Amazon) to make foaming soap. I have skin that gets very dry in the winter, but I find that diluted soap (which is essentially what foaming soap is), dries it out much less, while still getting it clean. Dr. Bronner's is perfect for this and rose scent, while a bit different, is quite pleasant.

Cleaning everything!! Great job!

I started using this soap years ago as a body wash. You do not need much as all, so it lasts for a long time! I have a little pump bottle in my shower that always has the lavender scent in it. In the last 3 months, I have tried many different versions/recipes to use it as a shampoo (including rinsing afterwards with an apple cider vinegar rinse and diluting it significantly with both water and coconut milk) and it just didn't work for me. My hair was all ratty and knotted, which isn't usually a huge problem, and it felt pretty dry and brittle. But that doesn't make me love it any less!TIP!When using this as a body wash, I don't love how thin the consistency is because I feel that I use more than I actually need. So what I have begun to do is thicken it at home! I simply use magnesium chloride flakes (which you can find here on Amazon, and which I choose to use because I can always use more magnesium in my system, as I don't get enough from my diet most of the time) diluted in water. You could also just use table salt! I take 1 TBSP of the magnesium chloride flakes (or table salt) and put it in about 1 cup of water and stir it until it is thoroughly dissolved. Then, I add the saltwater mixture about 1/2 tsp as a time to about 1 cup of castile soap. Be sure to add just a little bit at a time and stir the soap thoroughly between each addition of the saltwater or it will "break" the soap and won't have a uniform consistency. I usually use between 2/3 and 3/4 of a cup of the saltwater to get to my desired consistency. It's a thicker, white, lotion-like soap instead of a thin, tan-ish water-like soap. It's not as creamy as a synthetic lotion would be, but I really like it and it doesn't take too much time and saves the amount of soap I use as a body wash over time!

I love this  soap It feels so nice

The instructions said to dilute it. I did not listen to the instructions and I was burning and feeling fresh after a shower. You know the feeling you get after drinking cold water after chewing mint gum yeah that was my whole body.

What I expected

This stuff is good for more things than just washing the dishes!  Very gentle and feels good to wash your hands with too!

Dr. Bronner's soaps are great, we use it for everything. And it smells wonderful. We use it for hand soap, mixing it with water of course. I got the almond soap and the Eucalyptus soaps. And this merchant sends things promptly and well packaged.And I want to say thanks for your cool message about Dr. Bronner‚Äôs things they‚Äôre doing. I was especially happy to hear about the place they‚Äôre supporting, that helps autistic people, because my son is disabled. He doesn‚Äôt have autism, he has cerebral palsy, but I know how much support that community needs. Thanks for telling us about that.Blessings from BeaRemembering God‚Äôs goodness and provision, may you rejoice in His salvation, find peace in His care, and and rest in His love.Here are a few updates on what the Dr. Bronner‚Äôs family has been up to:> $1 Million Donated to TERI Inc.‚Äôs Campus of Life Program Dr. Bronner‚Äôs is proud to support the creation of a state of the arts campus for individuals of all ages with autism and other developmental disabilities.> Grow Ahead Dr. Bronner‚Äôs fair trade partner, Fair World Project is launching Grow Ahead, a new crowdfunding platform to support and stand in solidarity with small farmers as they address the challenges of climate change.> It‚Äôs All in the Soap Dr. Bronner‚Äôs thrives on working with small businesses and sustainability efforts across the globe in order to help strengthen their communities. By the time the product reaches the shelf, the positive impact is already being felt ‚îÅ because it‚Äôs in the soap. Now, your continued support helps us keep the positive change going.

So, I use the Doctor Bronners eucalyptus bar soap in the bathtub, and this liquid by the bathroom sink in a nice pump bottle thing. It‚Äôs soap.Nothing really to explain, except that I DILUTE THE LIQUID SOAP with water almost to a 3-1 ratio of water to soap‚Ä¶ so it lasts a lot longer, of course, but PRIMARILY to prevent it from drying inside the pump nozzle, thereby clogging it completely.I mean, I was already diluting it on my hands by wetting them before introducing the soap, so there‚Äôs no downside to adding a relatively small amount of water to the dispenser anyway. I now have the habit of squirting it on my hands before adding water from the faucet.Much better than manhandling the dispenser only to shorten its life, and to shooting a solid lump of soap clog out the nozzle followed by enough soap to wash a small car.Anyway, if you like the smell of eucalyptus, which is admittedly a bit astringent and not for everyone‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre willing to accommodate the challenges of any liquid soap‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing to dislike about this.They even still have the dissertation on essence gospel on the bottle for all you customers who miss reading cereal boxes.

After staying at an Airbnb that had Dr. Bronner‚Äôs soap in the shower, my husband and I were ready to try it ourselves at home. We were excited about its multiple uses, and decided to use it to refill our pump hand soap dispensers. BIG MISTAKE. If you read ALL of the fine print, you will see a note that states that it will clog pump soaps. THEY ARE NOT LYING. We had noticed that the soap dispensers were a little clogged, but kept rolling with them for some time. Eventually, I went to get soap one night and a large amount of the soap went directly in my eye. Per the fine print that we found (after reading that it clogs pump soap dispensers), I flushed my eye for 15-30 minutes. I woke up the next morning with a horrible migraine and a beet red eye. While I don‚Äôt blame Dr. Bronner‚Äôs for this, as the fine print does state that the soap will clog dispensers, I wanted to make sure to warn my fellow human beings who may not read all the directions!!As a body wash and household cleaner, it works wonderfully. The scent is delightful and leaves all surfaces squeaky clean. Just don‚Äôt put it in a pump hand soap dispenser‚Ä¶trust me!!

This soap is EVERYTHING!! The peppermint is very refreshing! I use this soap for my hair and skin. U love love it!

Great soap and delivered quickly!

This product is a must have. We are a family who has become enlightened to all of the chemicals in our lives. We chose to give up the chemicals and experimented with a few products. This product is OUR FAVORITE. We use it for shampoo, body wash, hand soap, most house hold cleaners (great mixed with vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon), leather cleaning, detailing the car, dish soap, and carpet cleaner.It has a great lather for everything. I would say that you have to get used to the texture of your hair when using it as a shampoo. It cleans really well but your hair will not feel slick like with other chemical filled shampoos. I use coconut oil BEFORE washing and then wash 2 times and I love the way my hair is after words. I do not blow dry so it gives it a wonderful soft natural look.Skin care is great with this product. We have sensitive skin in this house.. later found out that we just couldn't tolerate the chemicals in other products. It washes off great and leaves the right amount of natural oils on the skin. No tightness or drying effects like usual products. (We also use coconut oil as lotion nothing else.)A little bit goes a LOONNNNG way with this product. The price is well worth it because you can do SO much with it. I have had this bottle for almost a month and have barely even used an inch (from the top of the bottle) and have made 1 bottle of dish soap, 2 bottles of cleaner, 3 weeks worth of showers (we take daily showers), and detailed our cars, cleaned the carpets, well you get the idea. It goes a LONG LONG way.Lastly, I will mention that it smells GREAT and is good for the environment. What's not to like about it??? Try it, and you will love it to. (especially, if you are a naturally minded, ecofriendly, free spirit)

I really wanted to try this. I heard good things unfortunately when it arrived. The side of the bottle is cracked and the product leaked out.

We love using Dr. Bronner's products in our home.The soap goes a long way and has so many uses like laundry soap and multi purpose cleaner.This particular soap smells like almonds or amaretto and I find it so comforting.It's not drying and makes your skin soft and feeling super clean.

The only soap to use in my opinion. It cleans deep on the skin without being harsh or dry. The scents are beautiful and does not leave a nasty residue on the tub.

It smells like rancid throw up. I think I got a return or something but the package reeked of throw up. I had my mom smell it and she said the same thing. That is very weird and disgusting. I got the carton to reduce my plastic usage but if I know the product would smell so bad I would have either purchased in a store or the plastic bottle. I am not impressed and actually disgusted.

I‚Äôm sorry I hate to leave a bad review knowing how bad it is for business, but I really regret buying this soap. Even though the ingredients are really good, it‚Äôs way too watery.When I pumped it, it went into my eye even though it was 3 feet away from the soap. It hurt like hell! Thank God it didn‚Äôt get into my toddler‚Äôs eye instead or we would have to go to the hospital.

Dr. Bronner from the store is more thicker and golden colored soap. However even after shaking the liquid soap from this paper container appeared to me more clear and colorless. The signature string eucalyptus fragrance was not there. I will not buy this again.

This is listed as a 2-pack of 32 ounce bottles and I only received one 32 ounce bottle.

Good idea but container broke while trying to open it. Never again!

This soap is without smell an is like its mix with 60 water & 40 soap üò©

THIS DOES NOT WORK IN FOAMING DISPENSERS. It dries up and clogs the foaming depensers

This is the good stuff, folks.  Anyone who says the peppermint is too "spicy" for their bits is a baby.  Or says its "too watery and it got in my eyes".  Shut up!  My god how do you get out of bed every day and not just die?!?  Barely any plastic:DING, Organic:DING, Good for all purposes:DING, Affordable:DING, Many scents:DING - 5 DINGS ya'll... 5!

Love the soap and the quart size sealable carton is an economic option that also cuts down on waste.

I use this everyday now, love that there is no chemicals at all and the smell is very neutral and light.  Liquid is very soft on the skin and never feels irritated.  Always feel refreshed after showing with this vs. other soaps that feel itchy.  Love that it os multi use, you can use for cleaning and laundry as well.  Definitely recommended.

Smells nice, works well, and doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive skin.

I use Dr. Bonners soap and have for years! If you travel it serves as a body and hair soap and you can rinse out your clothes with it!

My go-to and pretty much only body wash I buy. I love this size bc it takes up less space and uses almost no plastic. The Almond scent is my favorite, but I may start to move to the unscented. I have been using Castile Soap regularly since college... over 50 years ago, when my beloved grandmother advised me to. She had lovely skin until she died. While I use it almost solely as body wash, she also used it as face wash and shampoo. She had beautiful shiny, silver white hair (no yellowing, no use of special purple stuff to keep it white) for almost 70 years - she went white haired in her 20's. Thankfully, Amazon sells it relatively affordable and I also buy it at Whole Foods when it goes on sale (which is often).

Refreshing Castile soap. I've used it for years. Vibrant peppermint scent wakes up your senses. Nice lathering action. A classic.

Will always purchase Dr.Bronners unscented for my little ones sensitive skin. Works well and lasts forever if used as recommended. Worth the price!

I'm glad I lucked upon this item before throwing the original bottle away. It filled the original container to the very top and there's no loss in quality of product. I will be purchasing the refills for my other soap scents soon!

I use this multifunctional product as body soap daily. Love the peppermint scent & the cool feeling that lingers after use. I pour the contents of this carton into my original bottle fitted with a convenient pump. Love that sustainable feature.

I didn't see or feel anything special from using this product.  Only thing I noticed was how cruddy it made my shower after using it. Nasty looking film all over everything.  Will not buy again.

Love this soap, have been using it for the longest time. The refill package called my attention for I am mindful of the environment, But it turned out to be a royal mess. The container was leaking by the time it arrived to my home. That is the reason to give it three stars.

Ordered it for my mom to make soap. As far as I know it's worked well

It's cleaner ingredients and environmental packaging are perks for me. It a milk carton style package but bc its smaller than a standard milk carton, it is more durable. I like that I can buy it in a larger quantity to get a better value. The scent is fresh minty and refreshing. Bonus that peppermint can deter some pesky bugs. I use this soap for hands, and as a general household cleaner. My husband uses it as shampoo but i prefer other shampoo for long hair.

It really doesn't have too much of a smell and buying this in a refill carton is cheaper and causes less plastic waste.

The refill cartons are a good value, compared to the bottles.

This is the second time I've purchased Dr. Bronner's soap. It works well and I like the fact that it now comes in earth-friendly packaging. They could have taken the easy way out and not offered this packaging, but they did what's right.

After reading reviews, I bought the peppermint scent this solely for the purpose of dealing with an aphid invasion on my palms. Most bugs do not like peppermint! I keep my majesty palms indoors in winter and outdoors in warmer weather, and especially hate seeing aphids or webs on my indoor plants. I mix a capful with water ( you can find the ratio online), and after a few spray treatments, the aphids are gone! I like not dealing with harsh chemicals and this is safe to use around children and pets. This  quart size container is a money saver and I trust I won‚Äôt run out anytime soon. I‚Äôve even sprayed tomato and basil plants if insects are a problem there too. Just wash carefully!

Same great Dr. Bronners in a less wasteful package. I don't think there's really much to say about this stuff in a review outside of the packaging improvement. I use this soap for legitimately everything and Almond is the best scent. Great change!

My daughter told me about this. I had never heard of it! Used it on my sinks, countertops, tub,and,most importantly, toilets! Idk how it works, but it does work well. A good staple to have in your cabinet.

I love that I can recycle my old bottle and have this refill.  It‚Äôs cheaper and efficient

Dr Bronner's soap in a cardboard milk carton, and the same good soap.  What is there not to like?

I‚Äôm trying to reduce my consumption of plastic and was glad to receive this refill in a paper carton. Hope it‚Äôs a trend.

Love Dr Bronners. Fantastic product. A company you can feel good about.

This purchase was the best price per oz for a product I use daily.

This soap is my favorite. In addition to their peppermint scent ! It‚Äôs good for cleaning hair body and around the house. You only need a DROP for your body on a wash clothes and it works !

Have been using Bronner‚Äôs liquid soap for years‚ÄîSo happy to see the refill boxes.

Same great soap, much less plastic.

seems fine

I have sensitive skin and this product does the job without drying out my skin. Smells awesome!

Hands down‚Ä¶ you can never go wrong with this soap. I use it for my facial cleanser, considering I wear makeup. I use it for daily use. Some has to dilute it but I don‚Äôt because it cuts that shine off of my face. However I recommend you doing what‚Äôs best for you.

Bronner soaps are excellent daily self-care producsts/  Great eco-packaging!

Happy with the fragrance.

This is unscented but it has a natural baby smell. The baby scent is so natural and faint but great  at the same time! Love it‚Ä¶

All was as described, shipping was fast and well packaged,. I've been a fan of Dr. Bronner's soap for decades, and still am.

It is great to get product this way and reuse my plastic bottle. Thanks

Always a great soap. I primarily use for body wash and cleaning, but it is very nice to have in eco-friendly packaging!

Would buy again

I love the product

Like that it is castile soap which is mild and that the smell is very close to real lavender from the garden.

Longtime user, lovely aroma and love the recyclable packaging!

Love that it‚Äôs easy to recycle, less plastic.

smells so good. works like a charm. I use this on everything except for my hair (squeaky clean to a fault- drying & leaves a residue- builds up over time). I dilute this in a spray bottle as a surface cleaner, wash my dishes with it, and use it as a body/face wash! good stuff.

This container is very convenient.  It saves me from throwing the plastic container in the trash, but rather use it over and over again, which helps the environment.

If you use this soap on a regular basis, this is the only way to go. Save yourself a bunch of money and get a milk carton of this stuff.

I love the after-tingle you get from the mint variety. I dilute it 1-part soap, 3 parts water, resulting in 25% strength body wash. Great stuff!

I grew up with Dr. Bronners and it's my go to travel soap, mostly because it's so versatile. Hair, body, clothes, dishes, even teeth. I've even used it as deodorant in a pinch (even on a pair of smelly shoes once). During COVID I would put a drop on my mask.I love the tingle and the squeaky clean feeling. And it's pretty easy to rinse off which is nice. And a little bit goes a relatively long way, in my experience.The milk carton packaging is very nice. I already filled a couple smaller dispensers and the carton was easy to handle and the spout poured very cleanly. Literally not a drop spilled.Highly recommend.

Yes I really like this soap, smells great very light the feeling afterwards is very refreshing. Quality is superb

I have used Dr. Bronner's liquid soap for a very long time, it is a fantastic product.  I always hated getting rid of the bottle and replacing it with another when the first one was still perfectly usable.  Now I can reuse the bottle and recycle the cardboard refill.  Love it!

Love this stuff. use for laundry, hand soap, dog wash and dishes. Excellent product

I‚Äôve been using this exact product for years. But I now go out of my way to purchase the new refillable box. I don‚Äôt need to buy more plastic bottles! By the way the product is exactly the same. Why waste additional plastic???

Love this soap! Use it on my floors, hand wash, and give my dog a bath.

Like an old fashioned milk carton, I think mine actually had like 33 oz. of soap in it!  I have loved this soap for years and used to fill from a barrel at a local shop, but it died during covid!

I refilled a plastic body wash bottle with this soap for convenience of use in the shower. It took a little getting used to using at first because it is thinner and pours out fast. However, it only takes a small amount to leather up on my wash cloth. I'm very pleased and will continue to use and attempt to replace more plastic products.

Love it

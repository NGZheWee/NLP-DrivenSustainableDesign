I’ve used these filters for years.  My most recently purchased box of filters smells like soap or perfume and when we made coffee there was a strange odor.  When I requested to return this product I got a message saying it was not eligible for a refund.

I was shocked at how poor the quality of these bags were. The first time I used them to filter just a small amount of coffee grounds at less than boiling water temperature, the bag split immediately creating a huge mess. The same thing happened when I tried again with even less coffee coffee filtered even more slowly at even lower temperatures - the issue was clearly with the strength of the bag. The only way was able to keep to keep the coffee from splitting at creating a huge mess is by double filtering, which meant that the bags were used up twice as quickly. This not only makes the filters twice as expensive per filter as they advertise, but creates twice as much waste per cup of coffee, completely negating any l environmental benefit claimed by the company. I will never buy this product again.

These filters break and the coffee runs through.Waste of money.

These are great coffee filters.The problem is that are shipped in their original box.  They arrived with the BOX CRUSHED and PRODUCT EXPOSED.NO RETURNS allowed.

I opened the brand new pack of filters (Qty. 100) only to find partial packaging with only 8 filters.

On 16 November, I sent the following message to the seller; as of 24 November, I have received no response. I have purchased your No. 4 coffee filters for years [26 boxes] and, until my most recent purchase of 2 boxes (100 ea.), I loved them. The first box's "'never break' patented wave seam" failed every time, allowing grounds to pass into my brewed coffee. Each time I thought that perhaps it was an anomaly and that the next filter would be fine. Nope. The first filter out of the second box failed similarly and, since then, I've been using two filters for each brew. That's not what I paid for and certainly doesn't meet your advertising of promoting a "Healthy Planet" and "Quality with Integrity." I can provide a long list of Amazon order numbers from the past few years if you'd like to substantiate my brand loyalty. But if this issue isn't resolved, you've lost a good customer. [Addendum: They now HAVE LOST a customer.]

The bottom of the filter opens up developing a hole when hot water is poured over the coffee grounds. It wasn't just one of them I tested three. Have some #2s which work perfectly so WTH! Really tired of so many problems even coffee filters. Then trying to return them has been a nightmare. Have had quite a few problems with Anazon employees blocking deliveries and stealing. The return page is not working, the Amazon return at Whole Foods was the opposite of helpful. I have the words to express my feelings but won't use them here.

The filters tore when poured the hot water over the coffee in the Chemex.Nobody would return my call from the company after I called three times.We use two filters at a time to see if that worksWill never buy again.Great customer service from Amazon prime

Half of these have holes in the bottom!!!!!!!And there is no way to return it  and get credit.

3/6 attempts to make coffee since I got these have resulted in the filter splitting because the glue or adhesive can't sustain sub-boilong hot water temps for coffee. Seems like a top thing to have checked for.Total trash. Ruining good beans at this point.

These filters are completely worthless.  I tried to give them a chance but each time was the same.

These split at the seam and let everything fall through.  Unfortunately cannot return.

These, even though I followed the directions on the box, the seam came apart. Coffee grounds blew right through and made a mess. Would be better if they made these into a flat square piece of paper that you could fold up in 4 to then open up into a cone. No seam, no mess

After three attempts to filter coffee I gave up. Filter split open each time wasting expensive coffee. Useless filter

Poured water in and the filter split right along the seam like tissue paper.No returns or refunds either, so only buy it if you need coffee filters for anything other than making coffee.

Honestly, I don’t review too many products on Amazon because I order so many.  But when I get a piece of junk I feel necessary to warn other consumers.  This is definitely one of those products.  Very first time using a filter for a lovely cup of morning coffee and the darn filter splits on half and coffee grounds go everywhere and ruin our coffee.My husband swearing the whole time.  How hard is it to make a coffee filter meant to hold cofffer grounds?!  So frustrating.

First filterFine grounds in bottom’s of coffee cupsSecond filterSeam gave out and all grounds dumped into carafePoor quality. Don’t do it

I don’t often write reviews, but these filters are terrible. We’ve used 5 so far and 3 of them have bursted open with wet grounds going everywhere. It’s not the way to start or end your day. I’ll never buy this item again.

I used the filters for drip down cup. I fit the filter in the drip cup, put ground coffee in the filter and poured boiling water slowly. The bottom of the filter broke and coffee grounds went in the cup.Poured it out, rinsed the cup, did it 4 more times, very carefully. Still broke. I threw away the  2 boxes of filters that I bought. Do not buy, terrible product, waste of money and time.

I am 2 for 2 on the filters tearing through and filling my coffee container with grounds.  With a 0% success rate and not willing to waste more time or beans trying, I can safely say the product is pretty terrible.  Save your money.

Got these instead of others because they are compostable. Learned the hard way they start breaking down pretty fast. First time using it I needed to move it slightly after pouring in the water and the bottom broke allowing my grounds to pour into my coffee. After that I doubled them up and it seems to work better.

Doesn’t matter how eco-friendly these filters are if they can’t hold any coffee. They break after about 150 ml of water consistently. Need 2-3 filters to avoid spilling all your coffee grounds into your chemex

I bought these because they are a more eco-friendly coffee filter option. It took me a few days to figure it out, but I realized that once I started using these filters, my coffee tasted like I was drinking a bottle of perfume and no longer like the Ethiopian beans I knew I was brewing. I thought there was an issue with my machine so I thoroughly washed every component but the perfume taste still lingered. And then I thought to smell the box of the filters and realized that it had the same perfumey smell. I won’t be using these filters any longer. Switched back to my old filters and the coffee tastes great again.

Not for chemex …. Filter broke when I used. The picture showed the filter in a pour over machine, but the fine print on the label said it may not work on all machines.

This is absolutely the worst coffee filter. Both times I tried it, it split at the bottom and caused all of my coffee grinds to fall through. Amazon will not let me return this item for a refund. Very unfortunate.

We had fifficulty with the seams kerting go. We lose 20% of the filters. Pour very slowly and only on the sides or product will fail. We wrote for help from the manufactor. No respinse. No return. Buyer beware!

Very disappointed in this product. We have found that unless we use 2 filters each time we brew our coffee, grounds show up in our coffee pot.

The paper just collapse when I pour hot water

Coffee grounds fall through filters every single time. Worst coffee filters ever used.

I bought these for my pour over coffee and every time they open up at the bottom and the coffee grounds just dump into my cup.  They are terrible.  I will not buy again.

The very first two times I tried to make a pour over with these they broke through before the brewing finished. Very frustrating waste of expensive coffee and time.

I want to like the unbleached type filters, but this brand really fails hard.Used with a pour over drip and made a huge mess.

We ended up throwing them away as too many coffee grounds got into our coffee. Went back to the regular Chemex filters.

In my most recent order both boxes of the filters constantly fail and fall apart from the hot water.  I now am doubling and tripling them so I can make coffee and they still fail.  Great idea for your health but completely unreliable to function as a filter. I've wasted so much coffee because the filters fail. Hopefully they'll fix the issue.  I can't recommend these filters as a good option the way they are currently produced.

No return option allowed :(

But these looking for a environmentally friendly filter for use with pour over coffee. The second filter out of 100 simply ripped out of the bottom one hot water was poured over it. Messy for sure. He’s just simply like the strength to be reliable. If they’d of had a return policy at all I would not have left a one star review. Let the buyer beware.

I need to agree with other people claiming these cones break. I used these filters 3 or 4 times and had the bottom give out twice.  I also folded the edges as instructed. If you use these in a coffee maker you’ll likeley never have this problem, but if you plan on using these in a manual pour over they will give out while your stur durring the blooming stage. Both times that it happened to me I was applying very little presure.  They’re just weak.

I have used these filters for  pour over coffee and occasionally have found some grounds in my coffee. the latest box I received are defective. the bottom of the cone opens up and half to three quarters of the coffee grounds are pushed into the cup!  i strained the coffee with a gold filter but even though I use 5 measuring cups servings  per coffee cup ,the coffee was tasteless and watery. second day in a row.  I did noticed the paper was thinner than in the past.

Every filter breaks open. I don't understand how there are 5 star reviews?

The seal on the filter breaks every time hot water is poured over the coffee grounds. Turns into a mess and a waste of coffee grounds.

These filters are absolutely terrible for two reasons. First, they make your coffee taste like your drinking from a brown paper grocery bag. Even aver you rinse the filter with water, it still retains that flavor...completely ruining the coffee. Second, I found that the filters break easily with coffee grinds spilling into the cone. These filters are not very durable. I recommend going with bleached Hario filters instead of any unbleached filter.

This product is very poor quality. I only used it 3 times , but 2/3 times while making coffee the bottom seal broke and all of the coffee grinds fell through. Don’t waste your money or your time. They belong in the trash.

These are crappy and they tear when my chemex. Should’ve just bought the brand name.

I DISLIKE IT

These are just horrible filters.  At least 40-50% of them break/split/come apart washing all of the coffee grounds down into your coffee cup.  So frustrating!  I wouldn't trust them to line a bird cage!

Whenever I am down to my last cup or two of ground coffee beans, these filters fail.  I use a Clever Coffee Dripper and when the bottom of a filter breaks open, it is not only a mess, but a total loss.I have a lot of failures with this brand.  I'm going back to M----a.

About one in three break. It’s the most frustrating thing. I prewet, I pour slowly and yet they inevitably burst open. Waste of money.

Literally every one I've used has ripped through. I've been giving it new tries for a week, at multiple points in a day. All have failed.

Bought these expecting them to be great, unfortunately they are constantly breaking during our pour overs.  if you plan to use these for any type of pour over coffee method save your money and look at another product.

On first use it tore and we wasted fresh ground coffee.

These filters are so much better than the super white bleached variety.  They are sturdy and do not fold over to create a mess in the coffee maker.  The flavor of the coffee is better when filtered through the brown paper.  The delivery was punctual, and the product is as described.

"If You Care" products are pretty good. I buy them when I can as I like that they are all unbleached and chlorine free.The #4 coffee filters work fine in a typical brew system or in use with a pour over style. I had used it in the latter and found that if I pressed the filter with my hand to squeeze out the last of the liquid from the coffee grounds, that it could tear along the seam. I don't think most people would encounter this as most people would use this for coffee to drip into using a machine. But just keep it in mind if you have a need to hand pour hot water over ground coffee- just let gravity do its job, and don't bother to help it along by squeezing out the rest.It is compostable! After you make your coffee, toss it all into your compost pile!They seem to make their products with care. Whenever possible I select one of their products over the typical beached or plastic laden product. I am not at all perfect in how I treat my environment, so even if I could do a lot better, I like knowing that t here are companies creating products that help us to have the "Least possible environmental impact" in our day to day lives.

Work great, and bottom seal stays sealed regardless of how hot the water is!  Happy!  Note, cheaper brands don’t always hold up to water, the seal can separate and let grounds drip into your coffee.

A much more economical filter than in local grocery stores and recyclable

They tear VERY easily when wet, or even dry.  Follow the instructions - fold them and they work perfectly fine.These cut up or blend well (with water) for adding to compost.

I can't tell you if my coffee tastes better or not with these filters, but they seem like they're pretty durable filters that won't disintegrate on you.  Saying that, I now purchase these coffee ground filters from the grocery store; it's cheaper at the grocery store (regularly-priced at $5-something at my local grocery store) than Amazon

I use compost in my garden so after I use these filters I add them to my compost and boy do they disintegrate fast! It works great in my coffee pot, my coffee tastes great and the filters fit well.

If You Care #4 Cone Shaped Unbleached All Natural Compostable Coffee Filters are an excellent choice for coffee lovers who care about the environment. These chlorine-free filters are FSC Certified and made from unbleached paper, ensuring that no harmful chemicals end up in our water sources. Plus, they're compostable and biodegradable, reducing waste and helping to protect our planet.I appreciate the strong "never break" patented wave seam on these filters, which guarantees durability and prevents any unfortunate coffee disasters. The fact that these filters don't compromise on taste is an added bonus, allowing me to enjoy my morning cup of joe without guilt.The bulk buy option is also a plus, with each pack containing 200 filters, so I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon.

Excellent quality. Hold wet coffee grinder without the filter falling apart.

They work. Don’t add any weird flavor to my coffee. Yes you do need to fold the bottom and side as the instructions state. Perfect for my pour over coffee

Ok so I’ve made about 8 cups of coffee using these filters and 2 out of the 8 have ripped and released the grounds into my coffee. I have been folding according to the directions and it still rips every once in a while.The up side to these filters are 1. They’re compostable. 2. They do not change the flavor of the coffee at all. It produces a great tasting cup of coffee when it doesn’t rip.All in all, they’re a great, cheap alternative if you’re willing to risk them ripping every once in a while.

Not a fan of packaging. Maybe if the box was sealed better. Filters exposed to elements. They also split open during brewing.

I did not have the problems that others are reporting but the seams on these filters are too wide, causing a large fold-over and non-conical shape that is about 1/2 cm too low on the seam side of the cone.  Possibly just a bad lot, but these can't be used with more than about 1/2 cup of ground coffee in a #4 cone-filter drip coffeemaker or the grounds come up over the edge on the seam side and drip into your carafe.  I have never had a commercial cone filter that simply did not fit!

The filters lose their seam which creates an open hole for the coffee to rush through without getting filtered.When these filters hold their seam, they are great. The first batch that I bought, only about 10 lost their seam. However, this current batch that I bought, almost EVERY filter loses its seam. And for some reason, this item isn't returnable so I'm stuck with a defective product that doesn't work.

I've never experienced a coffee filter that rips this often - I shouldn't have to fold up a coffee filter every time I use it either. I've had to refilter many many cups of coffee and I'm finally canceling my subscription.

these split open about every 4 or 5 filters. I will go back to Melitas

These filters kept breaking on us and we’d end up with a cup of coffee grounds

These are too big for my ninja coffee bar. I go to close it and it folds over itself. I won’t purchase again.

Expensive and non-returnable. The same quantity of unbleached filters is available at Trader Joe’s for $1.99. I like these filters, but not at that price difference!

I usually find these to be excellent and like to put used filters in my compost. My most recent box has had almost every filter break through as pouring over. I subscribe and save this product, so this quality issue is unusual. Has manufacturing changed for this item?

They break too easily. You’ll need to use two.

It’s great that this filter made without bleach and nuture looks color. But it needs 2 or more layers  when filtering the coffee because it drains too fast.

I like it’s earth friendly but it’s terrible when it comes to draining coffee. It takes forever! After three very slow pours I’m done trying

So far 2 out of 5 filters used had a hole in the  bottom. Very frustrating to find your cup full of grounds...

Just regular filters, no better that Trader Joe's ones.

Too big for being advertised for nenja coffee bar

package arrived completely open. and the paper is too thick for the melitta drip I use for my coffee.

A little too small for the Ninja Coffee bar.

I have used paper cone, pour-through filters for many years. These are too insubstantial. They let the water through too fast, so the coffee doesn't brew fully, and they break VERY easily if you try to adjust or move them in any way while brewing.

I’ve been using this product for quite a while. I end up with at least some coffee grind in my coffee every single time. Sometimes it’s worse than others. But this morning was so terrible that I thought I would register my complaint: This product fails to do what it was designed to do - keep the coffee grinds out of my coffee! Too bad… but it’s true.

In 2020 I tried a box of the #4 cone filters.  It was really good.  So 5/2021 I bought some more (not from Amazon :D), and it broke 3x out of 20.  I tried to contact the manufacturer but their site's "submit" comment didn't work.  So,  what's with the degraded quality?  I really like this brand's concept & price.  So could it be my fault?  I don't know.

Flimsy; had to replace the filter (and use double) to refilter the coffee I was making as they kept breaking and the coffee grinds would fall into the cup. Tried them with the chemex (broke almost immediately) and the pour over (had to keep replacing them as they got so clogged the water stopped dripping through). Waste of money! Can't be "eco" if you need more than 1 (or 2) to get the job done.

They leak!  Water bubbles up around top of cone and sometimes spits onto countertop - or hand!  Today there was a 1/4 inch whole near the bottom seam - had to start all over, pouring out the ground-filled coffee I'd already made.

Much thinner than expected. I’ve been purchasing this size of filters for many years - this is the first brand that have been so thin. The flavor hasn’t been hurt, but I’m constantly paying extra attention to not get the filter wet so it won’t rip.

I need to use 2 filters at a time, or the hot water runs on through too quickly when using a pour over.

I have used many different If You Care products over the years.  This is the first one that's been disappointing.  I bought an hemp filter for a Chemex and hate it because it is impossible to get the coffee grounds out and a lot go down the drain.  So, I bought these to put inside the hemp filter.  Every single filter I've used has broken and allowed grounds into the hemp...kinda defeating the purpose of buying these.

These have a very strong cardboard / paper bag smell and taste. Another reviewer mentioned that they impart an unpleasant sweetness, and I agree. I rinse them aggressively before using them, but they still affect the flavor of the coffee.For mediocre coffee made for the caffeine kick in an office setting, they are OK, but if you're using high quality beans and a good brewer, these are a poor choice in my opinion.I have not had problems with the seam bursting. At home I used these with a Bonavita BV1800 coffee maker and it is necessary to fold over the seam for the filter to seat correctly in the basket.  At my office we have a generic coffee maker and with it, folding on the seam is not needed.

The kind we've used is compostable (Chemex natural) but only needed one for each pot of coffee. This one immediately opened a hole when pouring the hot water, so will experiment with 2-3 layers. It's much lower priced than the Chemex is right now (we were getting Chemex for @ $8-9 for 100. Now it's a ridiculous price @ close to $30), so we wanted to try this cheaper brand.  It's okay, but not great.  But we won't pay $30 for a pour over!

Paper has smell, but great value and protects planet

I first purchased these filters in September 2022. I initially thought the occasional hole that developed in the filter was my fault but it soon became clear that it was necessary to use 2 filters to prevent the development of a hole in the filter.I don't mind and I am willing to use 2 filters because I am experimenting with removal of cafestols in an attempt to lower my wifes' cholesterol. And these filters are bleach free which is a definite plus

Love the idea behind this product, but have had multiple filters tear open after pouring in the hot water dumping all the grounds into the carafe.  Maybe use two at a time or try a different product.

I just received this and somehow I missed key information.  I just looked at the lane upon receiving it and in tiny print it says May not be suitable for certain pour over coffee makers. Very disappointing as it’s not returnable and that’s all I will use it for.I think this information should be clearly displayed as lots of people do pour overs. So for now it gets a three stars just for this.

I've tried using these filters on my pour-over coffee setup and two out of the first four burst at the bottom seams. I would definitely recommend folding these over on the bottom to hopefully prevent the issue and not waste time in the morning fiddling with getting coffee grounds out of your coffee.

I use hario v60 coffee maker, several times this coffee filters just ripped while I was pouring water. Now I used double coffee filter

Love the product, but packaging is not designed for shipping. Last 4 orders it comes in open package(Amazon package is ok, but their box is open) when it happens, the coffee has dusty taste. If I am buying it from my grocery store then everything is great.

too large

Id never used this brand before, and I do not recommend. The pack I got flavored my coffee with the nastiest taste. Unusable for that reason.ADDITION to review: I decided to try and salvage these- and was successful by rinsing out each filter before  adding the coffee.

These are ok.  Just don’t try to take the filter out after coffee is made, it is thin and when I went to remove the wet filter with the coffee grinds it fell apart, well wet coffee grinds all over the floor!  Make sure you use the basket to empty the wet coffee grinds and then its fine.

These are fine however I have not seen any difference in using filters from Melita or Trader Joes.  The manufacturer states they will not rip - which would be an upside.  I have had only 1 rip (Trader Joes) while tossing it into compost.so for me, the price difference is not justified to buy these.  Great to see more products that are environmentally friendly.

After receiving a confirmation for shipping, I tried to track the package and found "Sorry, ..." there are no details. I sent an email asking for details and still only given a date of shipment, but no tracking to my state or city. When the package did arrive, I noticed it was not from Herbs Pro, but from Universal Herbs. The filters are too tall for my machine, but I can make it work if I fold them. They are thin, but I like the idea of helping the environment.

The seal of the filter breaks easily.

In my latest batch of filters, every few days one breaks through while filtering. :( I am careful and gentle not to over fill.

These are flimsy and will do the job, but the quality and sturdiness lacks. With careful handling they will do their intended job. 3 Stars.

Make sure to read the directions or they will not work

I used these and they were okay.  However, I won't repurchase as I find them thin.  Twice the paper fell apart after use causing a coffee grind mess.

Doesn’t drip quickly enough so will overflow if you make >8 cups in a Technivorm Moccamaster.

They work okay, but some were too thick so the water wouldn't go through them, so I ended up with grains in my coffee.

These were not my faorite coffee filters. We did use them all but went back to using the ones they sell at our grocery store.

I was trying to avoid bleached filters, so I bought these - but they're seriously not sturdy, and they leave a strange aftertaste in the coffee...

wee bit thin and the price went up so I went with Melitta filters the next time.

Little pricey

Cool

Overall good filter with good flavor.Good certifications and eco friendly!Only con with this brand as they tend to break through the bottom occasionally (more common than the competition, not enough to really complain).Tip: rinsing a paper filter before use removes any paper flavor that you might taste.

they work fine, I ordered a coffee maker along with these and the coffee maker arrived the next day and these took 4 days to arrive. I had to pick up some other filters in order to use the coffee maker, I ended up going to a higher end grocery store out of convenience and paid the same as these for brand name bamboo filters that are a little thicker and stronger. That being said had I shopped around for the brand name filters I'm certain I could have gotten them cheaper making this not such a good value

I NORMALLY REALLY LIKE THESE BUT OF THE LATE PAPER HAS HAD STRANGE ODOURS, SO IT MAY BE GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IS THERE SOMETHING A CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT IS NOT BEING MENTIONNED THAT IS NOT SO GOOD FOR HUMANS? SURE I AM REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE FILTERS THAT ARE NATURAL AND BIODEGRADABLE BUT ARE THEY HARMFUL FOR US? THE REASON I AM SAYING THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE SMELLS, ONE TIME SMELL OF MOTHBALLS , ANOTHER TIME A PETROL LIKE SMELL, SO I AM NOT SO SURE AT THE MOMENT.

When my coffee maker beeps to tell me all the water has been dispensed and the coffee is done, there’s still quite a bit of water left in the filter. That may be a good thing. The filter is squeezing every bit of oil/flavor out of the bean. But I think it’s a hair too slow. I have to stir it for some time before almost all of the water has drained through the grounds (sometimes ripping seam of filter, releasing grounds). As I said, some may find the slow release desirable. I do prefer them over flimsy filters.Update: I switched back to oxygen bleached filters and realize now how much the cardboard flavor from brown filters was tainting my coffee. Will never use brown filters again. Plus, I don’t have the backup issue.I tried a different brand of unbleached before going back to white and no matter what I did, they constantly flopped over the grounds during brewing, resulting in truly disappointing coffee every single morning. I’m done with brown filters.

iT'S FINE, BUT SHOULD BE CALLED SIZE 2 AS ITT

We’ve had no issues with these!

These doubled in price. I could have bought them at Wallyworld but they are usually less expensive on Amazon. Think again. You used to get 2 for this price. Still better than the bleached ones.

These are fine. No problems.

I had no problem with the coffee filters. Not one tore or allowed coffee grains to seep through to my coffee. Nor, did I have to fold the edges. These are much the same size and weight of other paper filters I have used. I wonder if other reviewers are not used to paper filters and treated them roughly. The unbleached, natural coffee filters are a definite plus. I recommend and plan to order again as needed.

I'm using these filters with my coffee maker and they work great.  I fold on the seams, just like the instructions say, and I've had no problems with the filter tearing.  Though it does feel like it could tear, so I do handle used filters with care when I toss them. I'm an average coffee drinker, I don't taste any difference in using these compostable filters vs a regular filter or the "gold" mesh filter that came with my coffee maker.  Hope they work just as well for you.

I put these on subscribe and save and we had been using for several weeks and couldn’t figure out why we were getting grounds in our pot. Realized that these filters are JUST enough smaller that when we make a full pot (12) cups, the filter gets full and everything runs over it instead of being filtered out.  If you only make short pots, it won’t be a factor. It is a problem for anything over 10 cups, though.

I have been using these for a long time but the most recent box has left me with grounds floating if not properly folded.This did not used to be an issue.

Easy clean up

These work nicely in a clever dripper, the system I use for making my coffee.The only difference I can tell between these and your typical store-bought filters are that these seem to be a little bit more dense.  How that affects your coffee I cannot speak for because my coffee tastes the same regardless of which filter I use.  I'll definitely mention that it's a nice peace of mind knowing these are 100% recyclable and are made environmentally friendly.

Be careful about the pricing. They offer a single and a double pack. The single pack is $4 and change. Yet the double pack is $10.and heavy change. I really don't understand whey I can order qty 2 single packs fre a little over $8.00 and the double pack is well over $10.00.Otherwise, I really like the product. They work very well and I like the fact that there is a double sealing on the edges of the cones. Great value for the money if you buy the single pack.

The filters do what they’re intended to do. They do have/add a different taste/note to whatever you brew. I like this brand right now.The filters can be prone to splitting at the bottom. That could just be a user error.I don’t like receiving opened boxes, I wouldn’t buy an opened box item in a store.

The majority of the time this filter is perfect, but I give this product 4 stars because I have had the bottom fall apart a few times. It's not too big of a deal but is slightly annoying when it happens. But overall it is a great product and I recommend it to anyone. I use this product with the "Cyril Ash Reusable Burr Manual Coffee Grinder and Pour Over Coffee Maker" and it is perfect for what I need.

They work well.  Week made and efficient

Unfortunately, I purchased the wrong kind of filters for my coffee maker but I was still able to use these in the meantime. I love that they are eco friendly and they worked well.

These are not the "Correct" size for our Presto 12 cup percolator. As an add on the price is so worth cutting a tiny hole.Always use unbleached filters and these have worked great fitting around the coffee filter cup in percolator.

These work great, but have to be careful because the bottom will give out sometimes and dump all the grounds in, but you can just refilter at that point. Would still buy again.

They perform well, and I would have given them 5 stars except they are very fragile when wet.  Manufacturer suggest folding each filteron the seam prior to use, and it doesn't tear so easily on removing if you do that.

When I put these in my coffee-maker, the hot water goes through them and turns into coffee, without letting the coffee-grounds go through. I'm pretty sure it's also environmental friendly, which is nice.

Most brown coffee filters are still bleached even if they're labeled "Natural." I'm trusting these are truly unbleached. They're thick enough to absorb an appreciable amount of the acids in coffee which results in a smoother taste. Well-priced, too.

Not a very good value unless you just like having things delivered to your front door.

Filters are a little too tall for my ninja Coffee Bar. Good filter action, work as expected, otherwise.

Great coffee filters!Only downside is the glue used to hold the box together is weak. I had to tape it back together.

Great filters. Minus one star for what is quite possibly the most passive-aggressive company name I've ever heard.

Great filters.  The price is too high.  I bought an identical box at Natural Grocers on 8-20 for $3.49.

Filters good, doesn't tear but I still prefer the Melitta.

A substantial unbleached filter that will do the job as well as a unbleached store house brand.......maybe better for the environment?

I love these filters. No bleaching, all natural. Exactly what I wanted.

They filter the coffee perfectly but I have to cut them down 1/2 inch.  They are a little tall for my Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker.

They work just fine, but I can buy them at a local market in Dan Diego at 1/2 the price.

Got the job done

Very nice and easy to use with my pour over unit that fits over the coffee cup.

Good filters, but perhaps they could design an easier way to dispense the filters.

Good fitting filters, but expensive.

Great quality.. great price... 100% without a single failure or tear.. Will definitely purchase again

Does good job with its intended use.

Good quality. Work exactly as you need them to. Never had an issue with them.  I've reordered them multiple times.

the product descriptions are confusing, and there are too many sizes. but these work well

You should buy these paper cone filters... like, if you care.

Its coffee filters

Does the job.  I'm not convinced that the brown filters offer much better over other options.

These coffee filters are so epic! You gotta get them!!

Sturdy, work well, no problems with tearing. Will buy again.

These are great!

Good product.

I like these, for the $$ they are very good.

They’re flimsy, but if you follow the instructions, they get the job done! And they’re eco friendly!

I have purchased this a couple of times now and I am extremely satisfied with the taste of the coffee. The sustainable aspect of these filter is a plus and the reason why I keep buying it.

Great for morning coffee. Cannot complain! Works wonderful with our coffee machine.

They work well.

I like these filters because of the weight (not flimsy or too thick) and that they are able to get thrown in my composter.

Unbleached is the only way to go. Thank you!

These filters are easy to separate and easy to unfold and put in place.  The resulting coffee tastes smooth and full-bodied.

Perfect filter for single cup brew. No waste.

Like that they are unbleached

I have a #2 pour over and had been using the #2 size filter though it didn’t work well and had a lot of issues with the environmentally friendly filters. Accidentally ordered a #4 and it ended up working way better.

Update: I should have read the instructions that say how to fold the side and the bottom. They work great.The bottom of the filter opened a hole when pouring hot water over the coffee grounds. It has happened to all the filters so far. These filters are terrible.

Much better than bleached filters. These work great.

Great filters. They don't leave any taste.

I like these filters and was sad to see how expensive they'd gotten in my local grocery stores. So save a little with ordering online.

Great product.

They are a great product

I use these filters for the base of my container plants.  I am assuming there are not a lot of chemicals in its manufacture.  It works really well allowing water to flow through without soil.

This is the only filter we use in our house. Fits well in the machine and also filter the coffee well.

Perfect product. Coffee seems to taste better too.

I use it every day and it's great quality. Never breaks when using a pour over and it's compositable.

Works great.

Great filters for making coffee.

I've been using these for over a year now and never had one split on me.  I was a little nervous when I bought them the first time, but they've worked perfectly. You can buy with confidence.

Nicely boxed, easy to use.

I liked they were a natural product to use for my coffee

I like that the filters come in a box that fits neatly in a cabinet. It's also easy to get a filter out. I have been using them for over a year.

Was using the wrong size filter for a while. Glad to have the right one.

We have a MOCCAMASTER coffee pot and I just wanted to comment that these fit the machine perfectly and put out wonderful coffee. Would recommend the filters.

Not sure what makes these eco friendly vs regular filters.  Maybe the fact that they are not bleached white.  Okay.  They are sturdy and fit my coffee maker perfect - so good for them…

Perfect for my coffee.

Love these coffee filters! They’re cleaner than most, fit our machine perfectly and the quality is consistent. Highly recommend

If you enjoy coffee like I do, I find using the cone filters drives up my stress levels; spreading the filter each time is upsetting.This brand has changed all that; it has a tab to open the filter with so,  making coffee is a breeze now.

These work perfectly if you have a Ninja Coffee Maker or any other coffee maker that requires cone-shaped filters.

They work as expected

We got these for use in a Ninja DualBrew Pro, one of the CFP300 series. They fit perfectly and make great coffee. They're sturdy, so they don't tear or make a mess after use. They are compostable as well, so just an all-around good choice for #4 coffee filters.

I got an incredible case of the conscience when I figured out how much plastic I was dumping with k cups. I bought a pour-over coffee maker, my favorite organic coffee (BJ’s brand), and now I just compost the day’s coffee grounds for next season’s garden. They break down nicely.

Love how well they fit the coffee maker

True story: After an annual physical a decade ago, my cholesterol count was through the roof. My doctor asked if I used perforated coffee filters for home brewing -- the kind with the tiny holes in them alleged to maximize taste ("flavor enhancing micro-perforations"). I did, so I quit them. My cholesterol plummeted.If You Care's unbleached, all-natural #4 cone filters are my go-to non-perforated coffee filter. The fact they're responsibly sourced, biodegradable, and compostable is wonderful, but I love them because they're tasteless, they never tear, and produce a rich coffee in which the flavor of the bean shines through.Just a best-in-class product that gets used daily, and a terrific value at this low price. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking "Helpful." Cheers!)

No issues with change of flavor or anything like that.  They work and they are packaged without any plastic or the normal non compostable garbage.

These here filters filter my coffee right nice. And they fit in the thing for the coffee (Cuisinart) real dang good too.

These really are a step up from the every day bleached white ones but also seem to be a better grade of other brown unbleached ones I have had.  Sturdy paper that cleanly filter. even fine ground, the water through them making for a smooth coffee.  Will definitely get again.

Due to the fact that this box arrived partly opened I had to throw it out and order a new box from a different store, so 1 star to partly opened box.I bought a new box from a different store complete seal and safe to use filters.  The filters work great and coffee tastes good so 5 stars to that.

Sturdy and dependable paper cone filter. Fold edge and bottom before filling with grounds. Tastes fine. Fits all cone shaped makers I've tried. In a few hundred brews using a Ninja auto-drip, I've had zero cone failures.

I've had my Winix for 4 years now, replacing the filters every year as prescribed.  This new set has been in for just 1 month and it needs replaced.  There is a terrible smell, like something is burning.  The pre-filter is still clean so I know it's not something in my house.

Filter is too thick to fit 9800 properly.  Measures almost 1/4" deeper than needed.

First order that came product was damaged, not the sellers fault but had to order replacement. I just recently replaced 2 out of 3 of my purifiers filters with the new filters and they blow an electrical burn smell. I know it’s the filters because the one I did not replace the A filter on still smells fine. The black filters don’t smell but the main ones do. I would want my money back honestly because I’m going to trash them.

We bought this replacement filter kit (filter + carbon filters) months ago to have on hand when our Winix air filter light indicated we needed to change the filter.  A few days ago the filter light went off, so we replaced the filter and carbon filter.  Within just moments of putting in this filter and the new carbon filter our room smelled like someone sprayed Black Flag fly spay all over our room!!! Arg!!! :(  We thought it was just the carbon filter, so we replaced that with one of the original Winix filters.  The horrid smell continued.  Then we read several reviews that mentioned the same thing.  We couldn't return the item since we had ordered it so long ago.  We unplugged the air purifier until Amazon Prime delivered the actual Winix brand replacement filter and carbon filters.  Yes, it costs a little more for the Winix brand filters, but it is well worth it, no odor and no fear that you are breathing in something that is bad for your health!

If you compare it to an original filter, it doesn't fit correctly. There is a gap all around the HEPA filter causing air to pass on the sides of the filter instead of through the filter. I should not be able to fit 2 quarters between the filter and the housing. With the thickness of the carbon filter, the prefilter does not close completely. The amount of air being blow through my machine now makes me think the quality of the filter is low. I will purchase a brand winix filter from now on. You really get what you pay for.

The HEPA filter should last longer. I have to change it monthly.

These produce a terrible burning/chemical smell when used that does not fade after days and days of use.I bought the brand name filter and the smell was immediately gone. I'm not sure what the smell was, but whatever it was I'm sure it wasn't healthy. I bought another version of this filter (for a different machine model) and it also had this terrible smell.

I noticed today the change filter light came on.  The white filter was quite dirty.  I knew these were advertised as a year and verified confirmed in history I purchased this in November 2021.  As I was looking at the product to order again, I noticed reviews of the same situation.  I looked at my history on purchasing over the years and realized I had never reached the full 12 months without ordering another set.  I have gone through 4 sets in two years. This time it only lasted 2 full months.  Something may have changed or it’s defective.  In this time of high inflation, we cannot afford to get a poor quality product.

Terrible chemical smell on the filter. Don't waste your time or money on this.

I use my Winix air purifier for my basement bedroom, which has mold issues due to a cracked foundation. I am sensitive to mold, and I definitely know if the filter is working as it should. I usually buy a replacement filter once a year for $41 from the Winix store on Amazon, and they have always worked very well. I thought I would try to save money with this one, but when I installed the new filter, I immediately started waking up with stuffed up sinus area (first symptom I get with the poor air in my room, unfiltered), and am not sleeping soundly like I did before.

This isn't the OEM filter.  I had ordered a replacement online last time I needed one, and thought this was it, but it's a cheap knock-off.  The HEPA filter fits, but no idea if I can trust it.  The pre-filter has a plastic/chemical smell that comes out of the filter when you turn it on.  The dimensions are also slightly off on the pre-filter, I laid it over the original and it was about 1/4 inch shorter.  Will be returning it.  I now realize that I had gotten the legit replacement from Home Depot - if it's not in stock you can order it from their website.  Only a few dollars more, and considering it lasts a year, well worth it.  Stop buying cheap junk.

I received this filter today and placed it in my machine and the strong toxic smell was overwhelming. The lights in my 5300 that turn red when the air is dirty immediately went full red. I let it run for about 10 minutes but the smell did not dissipate, it was spreading, and the machine continued to show full red. I have used filters that are not made by Winix in the past without problems but this is the first time I’ve tried this brand. The filters are supposed to clean the air, not pollute it so I turned my machine off and packaged the filter back up and I’ll be applying for a refund.

smells bad

Worst filter I ever get. After replacing my old filter with this, the purifier emits a very bad smell. I put the purifier to a storage room and had it on continuously, hoped it would come back to normal. It is still the same after many many days.

I bought these filters previously, because they are less expensive than the ones from Winix. I didn't have a problem last with the last batch of filters. However, this time, my machine makes noises like it's blocked. When I take out the filters, no sounds of labor by the fan. I don't want to burn out my air purifier on sub-par filters, so I just bought the more expensive ones from Winix.  Lesson learned.

What I got was not for Winix products. Couldn't fit the charcoal pellet filter back in with the filter. With the wildfires I had to just leave that part out so I could still use the HEPA filter because we were do desperate.You suck.

Product arrived as promised. Installation was simple until I saw a gap between the filter and the side of the unit and the top.  I taped it up so the air will pass through the filter and not the sides.  I will not be purchasing this particular brand again due to the decreased volume of filtered air.

If I could give this negative stars I would.It has a really disgusting toxic chemical smell, this is for an air purifier, it's supposed to clear the crap out of the air not add to it!I have been running it for hours in an area of the house that I don't use much with the windows open to try to clear the smell but it hasn't helped, I am now without an air purifier with smoke in the air and allergies...

I had to put the old filter back into the unit in order to get rid of the smell from this one.  Almost an oily smell - my unit has an automatic air quality sensor that amps up the speed when VOCs are present, and since this filter was introducing its own VOCs the unit was not only emitting an oily odor, but also going crazy trying to get rid of its own odor like a dog chasing its tail.  Do not buy unless you like the smell of motor oil.

The Hepa filter has a PUTRID odor.  This odor emits from the top exhaust filling the room with the same odor.  I put it in an ozone room and exposed to sunlight for several days in attempt to remove the odor without success.  I cannot use this filter.  If you are sensitive to odors or have any other type of condition in which you are sensitive to chemicals, I do not recommend this filter.  This purchase was a waste of money for me.

I have several Winix air purifier through out my home and this is fist time i purchased aftermarket filter.Filter fits my Winix air purifier fine however within few minutes whole room started to smell like gasoline. I never had this issue with genuine Winix filter. This horrid smell never went away after several hours. I will be returning this filter.Do not purchase this filter, pay extra for genuine Winix filter.

The carbon filters break apart and fill the HEPA filter with black dust after a few weeks. The HEPA filters are not supposed to be black after just two months and I don’t have anything in my apartment that could be producing black dust, so it must be the carbon pre-filter.The official Winnix filters don’t have this problem. I won’t be buying these again

If you are purchasing this for your Winix air purifier, pay the extra for the true Winix filter. I had a Winix several years ago and purchased this filter for it. It burned up. I received another Winix several months ago and needed a replacement filter, not soon after installing the new purifier started smelling hot. I promptly shut it off and ordered a Winix filter. No more problems.

The first few times I bought these filters they were fantastic.  The last two batches look like the filters have been washed and repurposed to be used again.  The black ink on them is severely faded when comparing them to the first few filters I ordered.  They also don't fit as well and do not sound like the air is flowing though them freely. Buyer beware!

It smells bad like chemicalsIs not an effective filter makes the house smell badBuy the Winix original

I do not recommend. For fear of your health, start away. Filter gives of a musty odor when purifier is running that does not go away. It's actually reminiscent of a chemical smell. Manufactured in China, which immediately makes me suspicious that maybe it's even toxic. Stay away from this product, I will be returning and look for an alternative.

I’m not sure if I got the wrong product shipped to me, but it wasn’t the A size to fit my C535. I ended up cutting the filter and prefilters since 1.5 of these fit my unit. It was too much hassle to send it back so I just used what I had. But I doubt I’d buy again.

The filters fit perfectly, but the HEPA filter smells as the title says. I have had it in for a few days and my room stinks of it. I noticed the smell when I opened the packaging for the HEPA filter. It is not a pleasant smell at all and I am sure that whatever chemical(s) is responsible is not at all healthy for you and defeats the purpose of having an air purifier. I will ask for a refund but I have low expectations in getting one.

I had read prior reviews about this filter causing an awful smell..  I had smelled something initially, but I let it run for a few more hours in a closed room to see if the smell persisted.  It did.  I have a pregnant wife, and I cannot have this in my house.

I bought 2 of these filters about 2 months ago, went to check to see how it was holding up today on both of my Winix units. Unfortunately discovered that they are both completely covered/riddled with a black suit like substance. This is absolutely ridiculous, as the OEM ones lasted well over a year without looking even half this dirty.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT PURCHASE THIS, AS THIS WAS CLEARLY A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY

These filters are not genuine replacements and do not have the proper offset to hold the carbon filter that is needed for the air purifier to work properly.

I've order these filters several times before for my WINIX Plasmawave air filter, but they added an raised edge to the filter and it didn't fit this time. I'm not sure if my 2 years old Plasmawaves are no longer supported but

These unfortunately are unusable for me. They have a chemical odor on them that has not gone away in several months. If I run the purifier, it triggers migraines and insomnia. I just can't use them at all. I haven't been able to find usable replacement filters, so I am looking into buying a different machine. Such a disappointment.

We installed the HEPA filter, and added one of the carbon sheets. We immediately noticed an odd smell, like an electronics factory. I finally placed one of the carbon pads between the HEPA filter and the fan intake. That seems to have fixed the smell issue.  I'm going with a different brand next time.

As others have stated the hepa filter is very dirty well before 1 year. IMO the carbon filter must not be as good as the OEM carbon filter. I was compelled to purchase a new one from another vendor.

We've successfully used these in the past, but this time the filter has a strong gasoline smell.  It didn't go away within a few hours and gave us all a headache.  We'll never buy this product again.

I've ordered these for several years, but now they smell TOXIC! Not sure if its some kind of pesticide or something else, I'll not be buying from this company again. Several other reviewers from this year with the same problem.

It has a strange smell, instead of making the air cleaner, it polluted the air

Has a terrible chemical smell and doesn't fit right into my Winix 5300-2 air filter. The filter is too small and air will bypass it around the top. I can't use this and need to find something else from another manufacturer. I'm worried this will make my family sick.

Product said it would fit my air purifier but it didn’t! Waste of time and money.

This item was delivered today and had obviously been used. The filter is completely full and black. It’s been opened and it wreaks of pipesmoke. In this day and age of Covid 19 I am disgusted that I opened this up and breathed in any air around this item.

After a month or Winix started blowing a fishy smell. Must be a bacteria issue. The only thing we’ve changed after having the Winnix for two years was switching from OEM filters to this brand. Therefore I feel like it’sa problem with filter.

After 5 minutes when installed ... this product has  chemical/petroleum smell. Going back!!!

The filters do not work properly in my Winix. My Winix "clean filter" light remains on even though I've changed both filters. And the light does not go out when the room is dark. I will not buy this brand again. I'm back to buying the brand name. I should have known better.

The filters didn’t fit my air purifier also is not a replacement filter as the carbon foam isn’t the same carbon filter the model has.

This filter seemed to cause the machine to work too hard because the machine produced louder noises than ususal. Eventually, the machine began to produce bad smelling air. When I put in the more expensive orginal filters, the machine worked well again.

I've been happy in the past but this last filter smells like chemicals and has a bunch of globbed up hot glue on the seams. I don't understand why there's a difference in quality between an identical product. 5 days later and it still smells.

It fits our Winix, but the odor is too strong for me. I don't think I'd be using it since we have a newborn in our home.

SO IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE FILTER AS BEING THERE. IT IS TOO LOOSE.  ALSO IT SMELLS TERRIBLE. I WILL PROBABLY RETURN

This is the second time that after I install the filter a terrible odor is coming from my purifier. It causes me to buy a new filter after only a day of use. The first time I thought it was a random thing but it happened again. I won’t be buying these filters anymore.

does not fit

UPDATE" 5/18/23 I just ordered 2 real Winix True HEPA filter replacement filters. That is how much I don't like these replacement filters, I do not think they are filtering out the pollen in the air like the winix filters do. My wife is having a real bad spring due to allergies. If you want to filter out pollen go with the real Winix True HEPA filters.Downgraded from 4 stars to 2 stars, waste of $$ unless you really are OK with your Winix filter being less effective. I am not.------------These have less air resistance then the OEM winix filters so my winix air filter is now making more noise. It sounds like it is on a higher setting now instead of the lowest.I do not think it is filtering as well as with the winix filters.That said I do feel these filters are doing the job. If you are a through and through cheapskate like me then buy them, these are pretty good.Fit is not as good as the original winnix filters but good enough where I do not feel the need for any additional sealing efforts such as weather stripping or tape etc.Update, I no longer recommend these filters. Details above/

These filters caused a bad odor when I used them in my air purifier. It was almost like a burnt hair smell. I returned them for being defective. Do not recommend.

There was a bad chemical like smell when I started the air purifier the after installing this filter. The original Winix filter did not have a smell, and I am more and more concerned that the products that I buy from china may include impurities or contaminants the may be harmful. The bad smell of this filter raises concern about the suitability of this product in an air purifier.

As far as the HEPA filter, it seems 2b just like the OEM, and it easily fits into my winix 115115, so we'll see how well it works.  Since I replace these every 2 months, longevity isn't a big concern.But why two stars? Because the "carbon" pre-filters aren't what they claim to be; when I opened the plastic bag, pulled one out, it had a distinct odor - just like PAINT.  Indeed, my wife definitely smelled this when I turned on the unit! Carbon pre-filters aren't supposed to smell, they are supposed to be odor-free  (I know, I've bought plenty of these over the years at Amazon).I thought I just got a bad batch, but I read other reviews and someone else had the very same issue/complaint..SO, out they go into the trash; I've already ordered other carbon pre-filters (but from a US manufacturer who I've ordered before).

I was hoping these would be as thick as theWinex Hepa filters, or even as thick as other comparable generics. This Hepa weights approx 260grams. My last generic when I took it out, granted used with dust for seven months, weighed 380 grams and I’m sure it wasn’t because of 120 grams of dust.This brand just a MUCH thinner Hepa. I needed it so I put it in my Winex  (5500-2 btw) and started it in the highest setting. The air sounds inconsistent, as if it is struggling to get through. It a for this reason that I am returning the filters. I don’t want to risk compromising the functioning of the Winex.It does fit my unit perfectly and the price was the best I could find, so I will still give it 2 stars. Unless it breaks my machine.

I vacuumed my unit really well before I placed all of the new filters inside.  When I turn my purifier on I can smell a slight chemical odor.  I thought it might go away after some use, but it hasn’t.  Noticeable when you enter the room too. Won’t be buying these again.

Filter looks acceptable quality however footprint leaves less to be desired. There is at least a 3/32" to 1/8" gap on either side of the filter which is not acceptable. Filter must be a snug fit to function properly. I had to seal up the side of the filter so it could function.

This filter put off a bad smell which was sickening. Sent them back . I don't get that smell with genuine Winix filters which are made in S Korea. I'm sticking to Original Winix and pay more. You get what you pay for in filters.

From another review, I am having the exact same problem. “HEPA filter somehow changes the airflow when the air purifier is turned on high. The air filter now sounds very turbulent; it's not a smooth, steady flow of air like it used to be. The turbulence is present but not as alarming at the fan's upper-middle speed, and not noticeable at the lower speeds.” The OEM filter did not have this problem.

The carbon filters are too large to sit as they should without curling or bulging inside the HEPA filter. There is a gap at the top of the HEPA filter itself, which makes me wonder how much air is passing through unfiltered. I would not recommend these as an alternative to the normal filter. I have not noticed any strange odors as some reviewers have reported.

The charcoal filter does not last long compared to winix manufacturer. Can't vacuum it without it shredding apart.

No problem with the product.  But when checking around to compare if essentially same product - I arrived at that conclusion -I could not get back to my original cart, so I started over with my order.  But seems that you have to be real fast or you cannot change or zero an order.  Leo H. Frueh

The new filters have an odd smell and the Winix air cleaner rattles when these are used.  Will get original ones for Winix instead sadly.

It fits fine, and looks fine, but I don't like it.  There's a bad chemical smell, which is something that makes me know that the air coming from my air cleaner is not "clean", but "somewhat toxic".

Appears to be exact match, but doesn't fit as snug as an authentic filter.

Did not include my 4 carbon filters with purchase

Not only the Hepa filter is smaller than my Winix 5300-2 but also the carbon filters are smaller and thinner.

It works perfectly fine, but this filter only lasts 2 months before needing to be replaced.

You get precut “carbon filters”. Not the replacement carbon filter that originally came with the air purifier. Doesn’t fit tight inside machine like original. Not impressed. Will buy original going forward.

Musty smell after only 2 months of use. Room humidity is only 24%. Don't understand why it has developed a musty smell from a bedroom that is only slept in. Previous filters bought lasted a whole year without incident.

Even though it said it fits my Winix Plasma Wave air purifier, the HEPA Filter is too thick and with 1 charcoal filter, the pre filter wont close.  Disappointing.

I live in a fairly clean space to begin with, and only have an air filter because I've noticed they help with allergies. In the past I've had filters basically turn black over the course of a year. But for the first time with the isinlive filter I've had the filter go black with dust on both sides. This, to my understanding should never happen with a True HEPA filter, because it means that the dust and impurities have permeated through the filter. That said I'm glad they offer a cheaper option than winix that clearly works well enough to capture a lot of dust.

This is the first time the filters fall out! I’m afraid to use as this gap will allow dust to get into the motor.I have a Winex 5300 which uses a type A filter.Not worth the reduced price.

I bought this based on reviews. I have a Winix 5300 and previously bought the same set from crucial vacuum. It was good, fit perfectly. But this year I noticed it wasn’t described as true hepa and saw that my change filter light came on before the year mark. The original Winix filter lasted well over a year. So I decided to try this set. It wasn’t cheaper in price but definitely cheaper in quality. Really disappointed actually. See photos for comparison to Crucial Vacuum filters. The hepa filter is short and leaves a gap at the top and is more wiggly all around in general. The filter also came with the dent even though the box wasn’t damaged at all. Cool. As for the carbon filters, also thinner/less dense, as can be seen by amount of light coming through compared to the unused crucial carbon filter on the left. Poor choice on my part, lesson learned. Luckily I don’t use this machine for allergies but if you do I’d recommend another product.Edit: +1 for super nice customer service shoe reached out offering a replacement or refund.

These filters were easy to install, but emit a terrible odor when my filter is in use. Air filters should make the air smell fresh, I feel like I’m making my air quality even worse with these filters. I try it out every few days in hopes that the smell will go away but it hasn’t. Maybe it is just a fluke and is the filter I installed. I will try another filter in the box and see if there is a similar smell or not. I’ll change the review if I don’t notice the same smell with another filter.

Filters didn't last a month before having to be changed.

From the dirt it has been catching these last 2 weeks, I think it is a true HEPA.But I have a Winix and the red light keeps coming on.  I read reviews (after the fact), and I see others have the same problem.I am afraid that the unit will be damaged, so I am going to pay the extra $20 and get a Winix filter.

The hepa filter is thicker than the original and the pull tabs are on the sides instead of the top.

Product arrived in a badly beat up box held together with tape. Product inside was okay.

Purchased about two months ago easy fit, but oddly enough about two months later (now) it's giving off a weird dog smell and I don't own any dogs. I've changed the carbon filter and cleaned out the outter filter regularly not too sure why that's happening.

Unable to find the actual Wine. Filter any longer. All of the Mahtab’s are too small they do not snap and soul it very closely into place they are loose – I don’t know why because they all claim to have the same measurements as the Windex brand for the Windex air purifier but again they are not the same size none of them are the knock off that is; wondering why I cannot get that  The genuine parts/filter?

I believe I had ordered these same filters before but this time the charcoal ones I got were thinner and ever so slightly smaller all the way around.  It seems like maybe they thought they could trim the material a bit and no one would notice but I certainly noticed.  I will be looking for a different brand.

It's nice to have a new filter. I have the plasmawave and this says it fits my model. Well it fits but is an 8th inch shorter than my old filter and the charcoal pads that come with it, seems odd but it works. I may need to stuff something in the space so it's a complete seal but since it's less pricey as others I can't complain.

This filter worked as intended but it was slightly smaller than the original. I decided to buy a true winix filter that wasn't much more than this after about 3 months. It was so dirty in 3 months! Like dark brown compared to the new one. So it works but maybe the pre filter was letting more through.

Still not sure about these filters. Notice that they collect first in back of filter. This might or might not be a good thing since the cleaner part of the filter is in the front & the dirty part is closer to the fans. They seem a little thicker than a true heap original filter.

I've had problems twice now with filters smelling like burning plastic after a few weeks after using.  My other unit has a different filter and no smell.

The carbon filters are not in air tight packaging allowing them to get sacherated with contaminants before you even Install them in the filter.

This filter doesnt go with the carbon filter that comes with the winix. You need to use the carbon filter which comes with the package. The carbon filter that comes with this package doesn't look great.

They have a synthetic smell when running . Never happened with the oem filters. Guess you get what you pay for.

Good for price a little tight but it works

Only one Hepa filter!

The HEPA filter didn't last a full year like the OEM filter did.  The carbon filters worked great though.

Filter allows too much air flow. Unit becomes noisy.

Very undersized and carbon filters a bit thin. Yet, inexpensive so hard to knock.

The product emits strong chemical ordor

these filters are too expensive...anywhere.

it is ok for the price

So the quality control issues mentioned here did scare me a bit even though the sheer number of 5 stars shows there's probably something good about it.Bad news first: There are some quality control issues regarding the sizing of both the main filter and black carbon prefilter in that they are a slightly small.  There was a gap on 2 sides of the main filter and I could see how that could also cause some of the reported issues of excess airflow others talked about.  BUT I HAVE A FREE WORKAROUND! Take one of your old original black prefilters which are slightly thinner than the ones come with these and cut 2 strips to length matching a long side and short side exactly for the main filter and then use those as spacers between the main filter and the housing.  You will have to figure out your own way to get those sandwiched perfectly between the filter and the housing as it took me a few different methods until one worked for me without destroying the main filter in the process or causing to to buckle.  It will be a super tight fit but this not only seals the edges from unfiltered air but also would seem to rectify the issue with excess airflow causing noise and other issues for the motor.  I don't run mine on turbo speed, but sounds almost exactly the same for me with about the same airflow at each speed.  My carbon prefilters also don't seem like they will fall apart like others say but I can tell the quality is not as good as the original.Now the good news:  The black prefilter is only just large enough to not have any gaps letting air go right to the main filter, so good enough there.  And while a that dreaded gasoline smell from cheap plastics experienced far too often with many chinese products would have been a total deal breaker, that has not been the case for mine.  They smell about the same as the originals and the filtered air coming out just smells clean and fresh.  Too early to tell about any longevity issues, that said, if there are no surprises, this will probably be the filter I get going forward.  Are they as perfect as the originals?  No.  Am I still worried I could get a bad batch with the foul odor? A little bit.  But at about 1/4 to 1/3 the price of the originals (and with my workaround for the spacers) they are plenty good enough.

Just the right fit for my air filter.

For the first time since I have been ordering these, I got them fast and was totally happy with the delivery of these.  It has taken before this up to 2 weeks to receive these but these came to me in less than 5 days.  I am always happy to get these filters due to breathing disorders my wife has.  This air purifier is a GOD SEND for her to help her breath at night.  A MUST FOR ANYONE THAT NEEDS AIR IN THEIR LIVES.

These filters are reasonably priced.  They fit my air purifier perfectly.  I recommend them!

The filters are a little bit thicker than factory replacements but they seem to do the job just as well as OEM

have used these for years. change them between 10-12 months and have the machine running 24-7. very happy.

Hepa filter

How do you rate longevity on something you should replace once a year. Yes, it lasted, Yes, it worked great. Should I use it longer? Is it safe using it longer?  Expensive filter considering annual replacement.

good

They are replacements filters when needed.

I bought these air filters for my Winix Plasmawave air purifier instead of buying the Winix brand filter replacements. They fit well; however, the "Change Filter" red light did not turn off after I replaced the stock filter with this off-brand filter. I am aware that the filter in my Winix is new, but short of me manually opening the device to visually check the filter quality, I will not know when to replace it since the light continues to be illuminated as "Change Filter." Giving it four stars since it fits well (and that is most important to me), but took a star away since it didn't deactivate the change filter light.

Great value.  Filters are generally very good. My only complaint being that the charcoal filters required a small amount of trimming to fit the Winix 6300.  No big deal.  Just not that cool given that it was supposed to “fit” this model.  Would buy again due to the great price.  I can trim the charcoal filters for the lower price, no problem.

We replaced the old filters with these a couple of months back. They seem to be working fine, but we live in a house where dust seems to come from everywhere. So, it's really tough to say just how well they're working in comparison to the original filters. We do know that when it's turned off, we can tell the difference. For us, that's about as good as it gets.

Time for me to buy another box!  always try to keep one box on hand.No complaints - they do their job.  They fit - always a good idea - and I'll always buy more for as long as I need them.

But could fit tighter.

I use this product in our TV family room. It does a nice job of filtering the air.

1-18-19 Update-Seller sent an updated product from a new manufacturer. New filter does not have a petroleum smell.Great customer service from Nicole. I therefore raise the starry number to 4. Hurrah !Similar to other reviewers, my filters seem to have a petroleum smell and it's still evident after a week.The carbon prefilter fits better than the OEM Winix version does but I'd rather trim those than live with the smell.It's a good deal for the price but I'll look elsewhere next time.

Not even close to the original hepa filter it come with! This isinlive stuff is just poor quality!! The filter is even smaller than the original which mean's the air is being bypassed....I wished I would of looked at it right away but, the original lasted way longer than I expected 2+ yrs.As of July 19th the manufacture has contacted me about the issues and sent me a replacement filter free of charge. It seems to fit better and was pleased about there concern to make it right.Thank you isinlive.

Bought this for my Winix air purifier. I have never used this brand before. After almost 2 weeks of running it constantly I have decided to return it/call company for a refund. The room smells like gasoline or oil and it’s not dissipating. So disappointed. DO NOT BUY this product.March 2019 Update-Customer service contacted me and automatically sent a replacement filter. It does not have any odor and is working perfectly and as expected. So I am changing my rating from 1 star to 4.

I have used this replacement for the Winix once before. When I took out the carbon filter to replace it  with the new one I noticed that the new replacement was considerably thinner. I wonder how this is going to affect the filtering process. The HEPA filter looked about the same. I hope that this is not just a way to make it cheaper. I used the same exact company I had purchased the last replacement from.

The filter had a strong chemical odor, I was hoping it would go away however I made the mistake of trying to use the filter and now my room smells and it’s making me nauseous. Going to return this item.UPDATE 11/8/2018:The product I received was from a company called Hiloom and I was informed that the official Isinlive filter does not have any chemical odors by the original seller Little Nature. I will try out their filter next time!

Seems to be a good replacement

our bedroom

These aren't "sheer", they aren't meant to be.  I wish that Amazon would quit asking for that rating.  These do a good job in a room that really needs to have filtered air.  We'd buy them again.

Filter looks well built. The carbon filter are actually the same thickness as the original.Only complaint is that  the hepa filter is a tad smaller then the oem. I had to use a door seal on top and on one side of the hepa to get a tight fit on the unit.I'll probably buy again next year. Door seals are cheap and this is $20 cheaper the winex hepa.

I have resisted replacing the HEPA filter on my Electrolux Oxygen 3 home air filter because of the expense of the replacement.  This filter is half the price and meets the reasonableness test.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I've not run it long enough to validate its durability yet.

Easy to install and fit perfectly!

Works and fits well on my Winix 5300. It does seem like it got a slight bit louder ( I run it on speed 3 most of the time) but my unit a couple years old.

Fits great. Only room for improvement is longevity. I run my Winx C535 24x7 in bedroom. Allergen / dust / pet dander reduced significantly. Lasts about 2 months. Not sure if this is typical for my usage.

The HEPA filter fits well with the black filter however, the filter is not carbon like the one that came with the machine.  You get four pieces of the black filter and one HEPA filter.  These filters work well.  I change mine about once every three months or so.

Fits pretty easy and works well but I think it's a bit denser than the original, the fan seems to be struggling a bit more than usual.

These fit into my Winix purifier perfectly.  They do a very good job removing dust from the air. I do wish the whole system was an actual air purifier but in my experience they do not remove vocs.

half the price of the brand name and fits perfectly .

Made good, good fit, looks nice. I would buy it again, I'm happy with it and it did meet my expectations.

I like the quality..it was better than I expected..they are for my air purifier.

This was for my Winix Air Purifier.  Everything fit fine, it came overnight and I am happy with it.

Filters fit perfectly and work quietly.  Good product and will order again the next time I need to replace a filter.

Even tho these force the replace filter light on, they still work well.

Filter pieces appear to be properly sized and constructed, and helpfully include a directional arrow printed on the side of the filter for faster correct alignment.However, the carbon inserts are cut about 5mm (3/16") long.  It can be tucked into position with some effort, or trimmed with scissors, but it did cause installation to be slightly less than effortless.Note that this offered three filters and three carbons. Typically the filter kit for this machine offers something like three or four carbons per filter for a schedule of one filter per year and carbon every few months. I personally rarely think about changing the carbons so often, but if you're changing carbons more frequently than the filter, this kit will leave you wanting for more carbons.

I have a Winix WAC9500 air purifier (the pet model) and this filter set fits the machine perfectly. It goes directly where the cassette used to go.

edges were not firm and sag

This appears to be a good replacement filter and at a fair price.

It fits my purifier no problem but it is not rated as long as OEM filter

Good value

Ok item

Works great for the man cave we’re I smoke cigars

All filters seem pricey to me because they are just paper

It was a great buy and everything fit.

It really works. My house is much cleaner.

I've been using these replacement filters for my Winix air purifier, and I'm extremely satisfied with their performance. They work just as well as the OEM filters, but at a fraction of the cost. The fit is perfect, and they were easy to install. My air quality has noticeably improved, and I appreciate the value these filters offer. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a cost-effective alternative without compromising on quality!

Exactly what I needed! These replacement filters are a perfect fit for my Winix air purifier. The quality is excellent, and they're easy to install. I've noticed a significant improvement in the air quality in my home since replacing the old filters. The price is also very reasonable, especially considering the quality and performance of these filters. I highly recommend them to anyone with a compatible Winix model.

Fits our bedroom air filter. Works as expected.

Works well, fits well, nice having a double pack, excellent value.

This fits my Winix air cleaner perfectly, and works great in my indoor cigar lounge. It filters out all the cigar smoke. I run a window fan also to get any lingering odors, and the rest of my house is smoke-free with no odors at all. Even though the box says this can last for a year, I replace this filter monthly because the cigar smoke builds up pretty quick. 10/10 highly recommend.

This filter setup is priced well and works great.  Will purchase again in the future for our air purifier.

Such a great value! I use these for an older air purifier and they do a wonderful job. I change the heapa filter about every 3-6 months, depending on how dirty it is, and the carbon filter every month. They trap a ton of dirt and keep us breathing easy

Work great fit great

Exactly as described

They were exactly what I needed plus at a price I was willing to pay.

Fit is great and really helps with smoke from forest fires nearby to keep air quality better in home

very affordable filter replacement for my WINIX 6300

And at a great price!

Great fit work great

Fast on time delivery

Producti was true to description , fast delivery.

We’re correct parts

UPDATE: The seller saw my original one-star review, and promptly sent me another set of filters at no charge. The second set fit just fine! I'm grateful for both the seller's quick response, and for filters that work.I purchased this set to replace my HEPA filter, and I'm genuinely considering digging my original HEPA filter out of the trash and putting it back in my air purifier until I can get my hands on a better replacement.At first glance, the HEPA filter seems to fit into the air purifier well, but the HEPA plus a carbon filter are too thick to fit easily once the plastic screen is snapped into place over them. (Note: I'm using my last original Winix carbon filter, not one of the carbon filters that came with this replacement set.) The frame around the plastic screen bows out around the edges, rendering the screen obsolete--as you can see from the pictures, as there's already a white cat hair almost completely sucked around the edge of the screen, just above the tip of my thumb.(One picture shows how the frame is pushed away from the machine by the filters; the other picture shows me pushing the screen's frame flush to the machine, where it should be.)Possibly worse is that the new HEPA filter somehow changes the airflow when the air purifier is turned on high. I don't know what's going on in there, but the result sounds very turbulent; it's not a smooth, steady flow of air like it used to be. The turbulence is present but not as alarming at the fan's upper-middle speed, and not noticeable at the lower speeds. Unfortunately, I keep my purifier on high speed at night as white noise while I sleep, and it doesn't look like that'll be happening until I get my hands on a better replacement.Although I haven't tried to use the carbon filters that came with this set, I did compare them with my last (and still clean) original Winix carbon filter, and find these replacements somewhat lacking. They're thinner and spongier than the original, but I don't know if that would have had a noticeable negative impact.In short: unless I do decide to pull my old HEPA filter out of the trash, I won't be using my air purifier until I find a better set of replacements. Disappointing.

Form fit and function.  Delivery time as well

I have tried many off brand HEPA filters for my air cleaners in the past.  I keep going back to Winix brand because none were nearly as good.  These filters seem to be very near the same quality as the original equipment.  I just installed them so we will see how they perform over time.

I buy these all the time, and they are very well made and work like a dream.  I will continue to buy this product for a long time.

Nicely constructed filters, which fit great in our unit!

Filters fit great performance

quick delivery,fit was perfect,no issues,been buying these for years

I was fortunate to find this pack of filters for a customer's air cleaner. I wasn't aware that the black filter is Non Washable. Most filters on heaters and aircondioners are washable, and I had no access to owners manual. I had left a note letting them know I washed it. Thats when I got a text that I shouldn't have done that. Glad to find them on Amazon.

Not as good as the filters that come with the air purifier, but definitely better than other 3rd-party options I've tried. The black carbon filters provided here are the thin flat ones (not the cool deluxe ones from Winix) but these are very easy to clean and work well enough. And the hepa filter is good quality, with a more premium feel than others I've used. This is a great non-OEM option at a really solid price.

Easy to install and works great.

These filters  are sold at a very reasonable price.  Ordering is easy.

I recently purchased air filters for my air purifier, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with their performance. These filters have proven to be a game-changer in maintaining a clean and healthy indoor environment for my family.The filtration capability is outstanding. They efficiently capture dust, pollen, pet dander, and even larger particles, ensuring the air we breathe is free from harmful pollutants. With allergies being a common concern in our household, these filters have noticeably reduced sneezing and other allergy symptoms.In terms of price, they are reasonably priced considering their efficiency and durability. The initial investment has proven to be well worth it, and I will definitely repurchase these filters in the future.

Fast shipping, item received in new condition, it fits, and it is easy to install. At this time, it is too soon to comment about longevity.

Works great for filtering everything from smoke, dust dander, etc.

They arrived very fast and in perfect condition.

This HEPA filter and the charcoal filters work fine in my 5300-2 Winix air purifier. The last one I bought lasted a full year. And the price is right on sale at $20. Two thumbs up

Perfect fit, works great and have bought it before. Fast delivery too.

Looks like the original and fits ok

I had ordered the wrong filter at first but the company sent me an email right away and I was able to cancel the order and order the right one.  Good quality.

The product is just what I was looking for and good quality

Exactly what I needed and at a good price.

Nice set of filter. But leave a small gap does not fit 100%, eventhogh it a good buy for replacement filter.

All OK

This fit perfectly and was half the price from factory

Perfect fit! My machines running like it’s brand new❤️

This product is exactly what I expected. It fits my air purifier.

Like it!  Fits perfectly!

I use this in my son’s room. I can’t believe how inexpensive these are on line

I have been using these for years and they work very well.

I've been using ISINLIVE HEPA replacement filters for the last two years in my WINEX 5200 unit. In my experience, the HEPA filter needs replacement every six month when in daily use (the filter light comes on like clockwork every Christmas and Fourth of July). The carbon pre-filter should be replaced more often, as it collects a sheet of dust in no time which cuts down the air flow efficiency. The ISINLIVE comes with 4 carbon replacements, so you're covered for the life of the HEPA filter.The ISLINLIVE costs about half the price of the of WINEX's replacement offering. It works just as well (as judged by airflow and odor control). REMEMBER: You really need to replace  the filters more often than expected, so cost-effectiveness adds up quickly. the ISINLIVE is not the least expensive filter on the market, but I trust it implicitly--and so will you.

Great price and perfect fit!

With three dogs, an air purifier is a MUST. These filters fit great and so far are working just as well as the name brand, but for a fraction of the price. We keep ours running on auto so that it ramps up and down when needed, and the air purifier’s built in sensor lets us know when it’s time to change the larger hepa filter (there is no sensor for the thinner filter, we just change that one every 90 days).

It filters air just like the description says. Will buy again when it’s time to replace.

Thought this item would work for my machine and it isn’t working the light indicator is not going off in the dust on the machine is very thick and not going away staying away doesn’t work like the actual one that came with the unit when I purchase it

I paid for and ordered a new product. I got a used product. It was obviously used, the box had been ripped open, the filters had been put in someone else's air purifier, that person apparently did not like them and wadded them up and shoved them back in the box and they were sent back out as new.  Unacceptable.  Low quality.  Avoid these.

Yeah, they’re a great price. But they’re too big for the air purifier I have which takes “this” size filter. Also noticed that the name brand filter has plastic sides, these are cheap cardboard. Which probably means they aren’t HEPA!

I've used these for a couple of weeks and could not figure out where a smell of burning plastic was coming from. Finally I turned off my units and realized it was the filters. I've also had a sore throat since I got these. Do not recommend.

I was sent someone else’s returned used filter. That is such a hazard and completely disgusting and unacceptable.

Does not fit purifier. The quality is poor at best. Horrible ,thin charcoal filters included. Also looked like one filter was actually used. And smelled horrible. Very disappointed with this product. Went out, and bought the actual filters. Do not recommend this filter.

It's not fit, a little longer than FLT4825

I didn't get the carbon filters so the air filtration is not working and the red light continues to flash with the old one.

These were inexspensive, not like the name brand, but they dont work or something because when i install these its supposed to make this littke light flash green again. After i put these in the light contiuned to flash red. So i dont even know if these are working or not.

Uggh. This knock off is bordered by foam rather than having precision manufacturing to ensure fit. This poor fit causes a noisy air filter. I can't sleep with this knock off filter, but I can with the original filter. It's just not worth it!

I ordered according to specs that the item said it would fit. It doesn't fit.

These do not fit!  They are too large .....

Only came with hepa filters, no prefilters.  Not as advertised.

Does not work in Germ Guardian.

Could not use them , they were to short

The Hepa filter is too small for what I need.

Wrong size

While the filter was a perfect fit it only lasted for a few weeks before the the red light came on indicating the filter had to be replaced. Definitely not worth the savings.

These are the correct size, but the originals have a plastic yellow housing. After installing the new filter it would not turn on. After inspection, the new filter has a cardboard outer frame that was not solid enough to press down a safety lever on the bottom to allow the filter to turn on. I nearly destroyed the filter trying to get it to depress that lever. I ended up cutting the bottom of the original yellow plastic frame and attaching it to the bottom of this new filter. Then it worked. Kinda sad that I had to modify this to make it work.

Pictures attached comparing a genuine filter from the manufacturer to the filter and pre-filters you get in this pack. The pre-filter has fabric that's more tightly woven than the manufacturer's pre-filter. This has led to restricted airflow and my air purifier isn't able to take in as much air in order to filter it....which is the whole point. Whenever I would put in a genuine filter, I'd notice the difference within a minute (or less) after swapping out an old filter. My air purifier is in front of a closet door where a cat box is, so the purifier is quick to get rid of the smell on a fresh filter. When I put in the filter that came in this pack (after I had to really push it in due to the added foam on the top and bottom), I noticed little difference. It's been a few days and the air quality still hasn't improved and I doubt it will. I'll be purchasing the OEM filters like I should have, it's worth the extra money.

Thought that these would be a cost savings and took a chance on the purchase.  Look and feel same.  Fit is a little tighter but still works in air purifier.  After running the unit for a few minutes with the new filter my room was filled with a horrible chemical odor from the filter that was not immediately noticeable when removed from the packaging.  The cheap plastic odor made my face and head throb.  Since I am chemically sensitive I will need to send these back and buy original manufacturer which have never had an odor or smell to them.  Save yourself time and money if your health is an issue and the reason you use an air purifier in the first place.

The filter does not fit. It's close but it still doesn't work. It looks right but just not right . I'll be returning it.

There was to be 3 filters with charcoal filters. Only the charcoal filters where in the package

Change the old out add the new ones and the red light came on I thought I did something wrong but after reading other reviews I see they are not good will not purchase again

At first these filters look good and all but for people who run their air purifiers all day or at least for extended periods, these filters will not last. Compared to other cheaper ones these fared badly. It worked OK for 1.5 months till lights to change filter came on vs the usual 4-5 months I get with other brands. Very disappointed.

The carbon turned the white filters gray. Would not have been able to tell if the filters were dirty or not. I'm not using the carbon filters because of this issue.

Filters are NOT the same size to fit my particular unit even though it said it was

These do not fit perfectly. You have to jam them in. Still, that would be worth it if they worked as well. However, when we changed the filter at the recommended time, it still looked clean. When we changed my son's in the other room (with the original filter), it was filled with dust. Clearly, this did not catch nearly anything compared to the original.(In addition, this filter does not fix the "change filter" red light that is always flashing. My 4 year old daughter is terrified of the red light. So now we have a "new" filter but cannot use the air purifier because she is scared of the red, flashing light. This also makes it hard to know when it is time to change, since it always says "change filter.")Edit: I wrote about the change filter light but since learned you can get the light to reset by holding down the UV button until it resets. I still think it doesn't work as well but wanted to update this post to reflect that I was wrong about the change filter light.

The quality of the product is less than the brand name filters I had bought previously. Also, it was about 2 inches to short so there is a gap on the top.

Don't seem to be as great as the real deal

Filter seemed to be a little smaller than original filter. Have to play with it to work

Seem bulky and doesn’t want to fit

Not an exact fit for the Guardian filters.  I had to force the filter into place.

Fits great!!  I think the replaceable overlaying filters are too thick because I almost immediately got the red flashing light telling me to change the filter, but it was clean as could be! The original filter had a thinner replaceable cover, the light never flashed red :-0 . Thinking of just removing that part altogether and using the filter alone. Eye roll.

Very misleading.  We received 5 HEPA filters with no Activeted Carbon Pre-Filters.  I bought some of the pre-filter material from a separate vender and cut my own.  Was disappointed that I did not receive what was ordered.  The HEPA filters are well made and I am pleased with those.  The fit is more snug than the original ones, however they are working well.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Not of great value, items did not properly fit inside of air filter! Had to be Force inside also they do not last as long as name brand product house is very clean but these filters had a burning smell and filled up with dust extremely quick causing my red light to flash in blink within a month name brand item

Love my machine. Thanks for the filters. Easy to install. $ good.

One of the carbon filters smelled like a wet dog. No dogs around here.

Doesn’t fit perfectly - somewhat tight

You get what you pay for. Works but dosent seem to work as good as the original filters

Great and easy to install.

Much cheaper then other replacements.

I’ve bought the off brand ones when the filter gave the red flashing light. The light wouldn’t go off, I assumed it was due to the off brand. Switched to this one and have the red light. But offers good results.

Seems to be working just as the brand names do. Was a bit snug trying to get it into the purifier but haven’t had any issues.

I like the deep sides

I found it a little difficult fitting into the unit

It works

But was able to get cover on

If the price is right I would recommend them... Fit just right

Like HEPA rateing, convenience and availability. . I use for my room purifier.

Lil tight  at first try to put on cos the side material diffrent with the original.. but after couple tries it works well..

Filters were just what I needed. They fit well with the unit.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I had issues with the shipping.  Other than that, great product.

Fits Germ Guardian & is cheaper  price. Works the same.

It fits perfectly on the humidifier

Delivery of refill order is good. Previous orders have worked fine

These are a good replacement filter. Just had a little trouble getting the cover to close easily.

This product works fine with my germ guardian air purifier.  I only wish they weren’t so expensive

Doesn't protect

I bought these because they were much more affordable than the veva brand and they looked to be the same. I found that these collect the dust and dirt from the living room floor very well. The velcro feature to stick the pre-filter to regular filter is very cool. However, and this was an important thing to note, these filters had to be squeezed in to fit the filter cabinet or filter space on the air purifier machine. They don't quite fit exactly right as easily as the veva brand. Also it is important to note that to the red blinking light, which means something isn't right with the machine, blinks with this filter installed oh, and I never had that problem with the OEM brand filters. So, these do the job although they are a little wonky.

I was afraid that these filters were not going to fit or cause the machine to not work like some other filters we had tried. The fit is very tight, the purifier is still working, so I guess all is good.

It’s not an OEM part. This is aftermarket cardboard frame, not a plastic frame. It is a tighter fit than the OEM one and you need to press it in. Other than that the filter media looks identical. I’ll buy it again

Nothing overly special. Direct replacement filters fit how they need to.

The fit of the filter itself was far more snug than other generic brands I've purchased but with a bit of a shove it worked well for the unit. Runs as normal, can't tell the difference from the actual Germ Guardian one that came with the unit. I'd purchase these again.

Glad we found these filter replacements. They are less expensive than what we were using prior, and install a but differently,  but it worked out. Be advised that these muffle the sound less and therefore your unit will be louder than usual.

First package it did not have black filter. There was no memo for directions. So I thought it was missing parts. I claimed and requested refund But I got black filter later on. It was confusing ! Products are great.

This seems to be a fine filter element, but it doesn't fit the Toshiba air purifier for which I bought it.  This could have been a lot more clear, like stating the dimensions of the filter in the ad.

Mine didn’t fit nicely had to use a bit of force to push in. The one I was replacing slides in and out no problem so I’ll see where I got those next time.

Met my needs.

Good

Nothing to dislike.  Great value.  Easy to install.  Will purchase  again when needed.

Good price

This was a great fit for my machines. Quality was good for the price. They have worked well so far

They were not in OEM box but look idenical.  Seem to be doing the job just the way they are supposed to.

Everything it claimed to be.  These simple filters for our air filter arrived quickly and were exactly as described.  Good proce and value in the multipack format.

My GermGaudian Filter would vibrate. I used this filter and how tight it fits stops the vibration.

These filters worked just fine. I had no issues. Would buy them again.

Fast Service, clean, fresh air again!

Everthing fitted properly and shipped fast

Fits, but is a little bigger than original, so it fits very tight.

Good value - easy install and came with several pre-filters which was a plus.  Would buy again.

They worked great thank you

Works just as good as the expensive name brand, just much cheaper.

Quick and easy to install. Works great

Works perfect for my purifier.

Low noise after changing filter.

When are you going to make a washable HEPA filter?

Replacement filter for my Germguardian

Can’t complain

Excellent filters

They are very good filters. Easy to store and discard after use. I think they very good value,  priced reasonably.  Do a good job.

Very good filter fits perfectly

Haven’t ordered these in a while. Same great filters! Work great.

Better value for your money. It's sad to say that I love seeing how much dustbin collects. The filters are amazing. Very easy to install already had the velcro on the filter so you just needed to attach the charcoal.

I got the room air cleaner and wanted replacement filters. Great value. Well made

Item as described, bought multiple times

I just installed these on my germ guardian  air purifier and i was immediately impressed.I have ordered numerous different "knock off" filters for my air purifier and i noticed that some of them contained some kind of cheap nylon woven fiber material instead of the actual carbon filter (like the one that comes with the original filter).This one contains ACTUAL carbon filters that go with the main filter. They are also the thickest carbon filters I've ever received from a "knock off" brand. Seriously, these are so similar to the original that you'd think they're made in the same factory. In addition, i noticed the main filters have a sponge material glued to the top and bottom to give it more of a snug and secure fit inside of the filter compartment. I've never seen this before with other air filters, and it was reassuring to see this seller's attention to detail on the product.I rarely give reviews on products but i really wanted to vouch for this product on behalf of somebody who has asthma and has been searching for a product like this (at a reasonable price) for ages!

Great quality

Replacement Filters...

Can tell the difference of improvement because I dont smell the wildfire smoke in here.

Work as well as original brand for lower price

Bought this and it keeps my room air clean

wow very nice

Easy to install.  Good value for everything received.  I don't know how to judge whether it works or not but it looks like the original filter that came with the unit.

Price is right, quantity is good.  Cannot ask for more.

Just received these and am very impressed at the quality for the priceThe carbon filters are better quality than the original one that came with the purifierDefinitely will buy again

item as described and additional pre filters made it even a better deal. thanks alot

I had a couple I haven't used a year or so... Allergy season is insane this year!!!!Wiped them down.... Installed the filter.... Didn't put the black filter holder piece back. On... So of course it didn't hit the senors..I'll but these again. Snug fit.... 2 pack!!

I've purchased these before for my GermGuardian unit and am very impressed with the quality and durability of these filters. They last nearly 6 months and I love that they include extra carbon filters too! Just need to remember to change those out more often...

Works great and comes with 8 charcoal filters too. Nice for the price.

So I have gotten several brands of these filters - and this brand works well - its snug in the Air Filter.  If it is not snug like other brands then the filter machine will not turn on without having to add something to the top of the filters to make it snug.  A++

These filters fit just right and I love that extra pre-filters are included. Great bargain.

I mark my calendar so I change the pre-filter every 2 months and new filter every six months.

That it fits💘

Loved it cause the filters will last a year. Not bad at all for 20 bucks

easy replacement. extra charcoal filters are a bonus

It fits the machine and is cheaper then the rest.

These things work great and the upside is the black filter can be washed out and reused..

Good quality filters I like that they are bright white color so later I can see easier what they filter out…. Nice !  😀👍

They are easy to install and they give you easy-to-follow instructions so even a child could install it. Great product.

Worked perfectly and was an exact fit. If one can love a HEPA filter replacement..this is it.

The ease of use, dust protection

Exact match for what was in the unit.

These always fit well and have the anticipated use-life in our germ guardian air purifier.

All good. Great deal. Fit perfect in my 2 Germguardian 4825. They are way more quiet after replacing.

Dose it's job.  Bought this product multiple times

Works well great price sturdy fits perfectly

Perfect tight fit and the charcoal filters are washable. Purchased these last time and I washed the charcoal filters I let them dry completely before putting themBack on. The Velcro is very strong and grips the charcoal filter very well so you do not need to worry about it coming off. If you have a Germ guardian that takes these filters do not hesitate they are a quality product.

Perfect fit!

I really like this product and use it in the basement!

Price is great.  Filter fits.

Replacement filters.  Works perfectly.

These are a perfect fit and are well constructed making them a good replacement filter at a much lower cost than original filters.

If you have a germ guardian air purifier you know how costly the authentic filters are. These are excellent alternatives.

good price and  works great

I purchased this for my Guardian AC4800. The HEPA and Charcoal elements of the filter looked and fit like the OME filter set that came with the Guardian air purifier and at half the price. I purchased 4 Germ Guardian air purifiers in 2020 and have been extremely satisfied with their reliability and performance. Access to replacement filters of this quality at this price has contributed to that satisfaction.

It’s what we expected.

It was a good value for the money.

Always a great buy from Amazon.

works good and easy to maintain

Fast delivery and worked just as well as the ones that came with the HPA300. Great savings, will surely buy again.

I have been purchasing isinlive replacement filters for my Honeywell air purifier multiple (6) times, and they have consistently exceeded my expectations. These filters are undoubtedly my go-to choice, and I always feel delighted with their performance.One of the standout features of these isinlive replacement filters is their compatibility with a wide range of Honeywell air purifier models, including HPA300, HPA304, HPA3300, HPA3300b, HPA5300, HPA8350, and HPA300VP. This versatility ensures that no matter which Honeywell air purifier you own, these filters have got you covered.The filters are made from H13 True HEPA material and feature a carbon layer. This combination provides multiple levels of cleaning that significantly improve indoor air quality. The True HEPA filter effectively captures particles and allergens, while the activated carbon layer helps to eliminate odors, making the air in my home noticeably fresher and cleaner.The inclusion of pre-cut activated carbon pre-filters is a thoughtful touch. These pre-filters extend the life of the primary HEPA filters, saving both time and money. The package includes 3 HEPA filters and 4 pre-cut activated carbon pre-filters, ensuring you have everything you need for a complete replacement. The dimensions are also perfectly designed to fit your Honeywell air purifier, so installation is a breeze.What truly sets ISLive apart is its commitment to customer satisfaction. They offer a product assurance that gives me peace of mind. If I'm not completely satisfied with anything about the filters, they promise a full refund or reshipping a new pack. This level of customer care and confidence in their product is impressive and greatly appreciated.In summary, isinlive replacement filters are consistently top-rated products in my book. They are my go-to choice for maintaining clean and healthy air in my home. With their compatibility, quality, and commitment to customer satisfaction, I couldn't be happier with these filters. If you need replacement filters for your Honeywell air purifier, look no further than isinlive.

Fits perfect and a great price!!

The only notable issue is the fact the carbon filter is folded making the fit a little difficult.  I placed the carbon filter under a large cutting board with some weight, the fold lines straightened out on in a day; making the fit much better.  The other three filters had no issues and fit just fine.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I’ve bought these replacement filters a handful of times and I love them. Great quality, easy to replace and cut to size. My household suffers from allergies and asthma, with having two pets I notice the air is cleaner with these filters. My air purifier performs just as well with these budget friendly filters. I keep my purifier on turbo and the noise is the same. The functionality is worth the investment.

The fit was great and quality  seems to match brand that was removed

Works well and very affordable.  Definitely recommend it

Works in my Honeywell air purifier! Will order again when I need refills

The black filter is not the correct size. Short about 1/4 inch. Doesn't stay in position. Not sure how well it will work with the gap.

These were much less than other filters and exactly what we needed.  The quality is good.

These do not fit in snuggly at all. I unwrapped them  because I need them now for some home construction we're doing, so I can't return them, but I will not buy them again. The 100 was just as bad, but the 300 is more noticeable. Too me I think that leaves to much space where things can get thru unfiltered. The black filters were folded in 4s so they're super wrinkled and hard to keep in but hopefully they'll straighten. I'll have to buy another brand soon to replace these.

I bought this bundle several months ago and had initially only been using the charcoal pre-filters.  They do come folded in fourths, so installation is a bit of a challenge due to the deep creases.  (It was easier to keep in place under the clips if the crease is on top.)  I tried to install the 3 main filters yesterday, but immediately noticed a heavy chemical smell upon removing each filter from the plastic bags.  After installation and turning the unit on, the smell was quite noticeable.  I took the filters outside and let them "air out" for several hours and then placed them in the garage overnight.  I just reinstalled them, and noticed the smell again upon turning the machine on.  I ran the turbo mode for several minutes, and the smell has now lessened, but still remains.  I do not know why they have an order.  I will try placing them outside again today for an additional "airing".  Is it the filter itself or from the plastic bag it came in?  Regardless, the smell is a concern (as others have mentioned) and although the price is reasonable, I most likely will not repurchase these in the future.

The pre-filters(black) are huge....way larger than the white filter.  I had to cut it down to size to fit and since they were folded up, it didn't want to sit right in my Honeywell air purifier. These are significantly cheaper than the name brand ones, so it's not a huge issue, just wish I would have k own this before purchasing. We'll see how well they work in comparison.

They pack these in weird numbers! You only need one of the black at a time and two of the white, but they only send three of the white so you have to order another pack to get two changes and you have tons of the black one, so that's not getting g your money's worth. But they are great HEPA filters and work really well!

The filters fit and seem to work well. The pre-filters were NOT cut to size; they were one big sheet that needed to be cut. Not sure if this was the manufacturer or if Amazon sent the wrong product because the white box they came in was not labeled.  It was a bit of a pain to cut them to fit.

the hepa filter seems to work and fit fine.  as noted in other reviews, it initially has a slight odor but that went away within an hour.  the secondary "charcoal" filter that came with this does not fit my honeywell model so it is useless to me- very disappointed with that

I was hoping that these would fit like the originals did. They were slightly undersized but extremely close in size. Close enough, so they worked.

The hepa filters fit well but the carbon filters are too small. Also very creased from folding and do not stay in well. The lack of full coverage will lead the hepa filter inserts to get dirty prematurely. Better off spending the money for the original brand parts.

Black filters were not correct size. I had to cut them down to size.

Had to stuff it in my Hepa and it made my red light come on

Would have liked for these to work considering they’re substantially more affordable than the name brand. However, the light to change filter won’t turn off no matter how many filter changes I’ve tried with this brand & there is a smell that comes from the filter. Will not be buying again.

These filters are easy to install, very much like the OEM filters which are cost-prohibitive to use unless you want a maintenance bill of of a major public works project just on filter replacement.  These, however are affordable enough and give you great ROI, you don't cringe when it's time to change filters, which means I can change them out when it seems like time to me, I'm not chained to a recommended product life span with an imaginary 6 month useful life.  Trying to make expensive filters last is a losing battle in my home, and the result is filter-change fear, because I don't want to spend $83 (for 3, which is what my purifier requires, and that's the factory outlet price, no carbon pre-filters included).  Instead, these filters give me value I appreciate, for money well-spent.

These seem like good enough quality, but the charcoal odor filters are smaller by about 3 eights of an in all around. This makes it too small to stay in place under the hooks and keep flopping down when installing. Not to me mention being too small means more dust gets through.

**UPDATE** Strangely, these fit my one smaller Hepa air purifier, but NOT the other one! Both air purifiers are Honeywell and use the same size replacement filters, so it's weird these didn't fit my larger purifier - they install horizontally and I had to bend and force these in and they don't really fit at all. My smaller purifier loads one filter vertically and that one fit perfectly. Never had this issue before with replacement filters...strange!So far, these are exceeding my expectations after being tired of paying exorbitant prices for replacement filters - as I go through these QUICKLY where I live. This is the first time I've purchased this brand and will definitely buy them again.

The HEPA filters do not fit precisely into the HPA300: too narrow by some milliliters and too wide by some milliliters too. Also, the edges around the corners seem slightly unglued. The small gaps due to a bad fit must cut down on the efficacy of the filter. Overall the construction seems shoddy.You get what you pay for.I am getting authentic filters next time.

Unfortunately they're now adding perfume/fragrance to these filters - I'll be ordering a different product next time

Prefilter is not on par with the OE Pre filter. It is much more porouse. I am skeptical of the quality of the HEPA filters due to this, they have no markings.

I'm honestly not sure if this filter is doing the job like the original product. The air doesn't crisp like the original one does. And it makes the sound of shaking a little bit. I wouldn't buy it again if the genuine product isn't that expensive right now.

The HEPA filters fit alright, but the pre-filter could stand to be about an inch wider. It barely covers the HEPAs, allowing unfiltered air to seep in around the sides.

The black prefilter needed to be cut to size. Otherwise all good.

It didn’t fit very well but it works so far.

The black filter is slightly too big and thinner than original

I bought this for a Honeywell HPA5250 Air Purifier (info said it was compatible). Yes it does works, however the Honeywell 5250 requires 2 HEPA filters at the same time. Now I have one new HEPA filter left over that has to be used with one of the existing filters during the next filter change or the seller 'isinlive' expects you to buy two packs. Why not offer options, lower the price and sell two HEPA filters or increase the price and sell 4 HEPA filters? Having to cut the black pre-filter to the proper size is annoying too. Despite the annoyances, the price was right. I will just keep comparing product prices the next time I require new air filters.

Only received 6/7 parts. The four larger black filters were in the box, but only 2 of the smaller white ones when there should have been three. Perhaps it just got missed.

I have Honeywell 5250 and this says good for the size but prefilter smaller from the original size 😡

The filters fit perfectly only think is the check filter light stayed on after using isinlive filters.  Do I seriously have to buy Honeywell filters to fix that?

Carbon filter could be a few mm bigger cause right now its not covering the whole area of our unit

Smell goes away in about a day

Price's are just so high,  easy to remove old install new.

These filters are very similar to the brand  name that I usually purchase at 3 times the cost.

Just what I expected.

This came super-fast and a complete kit. The only downside is that the oem filters show you what direction to install filters and this does not. Not super critical in order to figure out but it definitely would be helpful for those who need it broken down for them....

The product is a good value. The pre-filters should com rolled instead of folded.

Easy to install the filter annd  easy to cut the prefilter. A necessary product to maintain the Honeywell air purifier.

Everything good but the black pre filters come in uncut sheets. Not a big deal. Easy to cut.

The white pleated filters are fine and fit well. However, the black pre-filter comes in two oversized sheets that you must cut to fit some of the systems. Not a huge deal but cutting it to fit just right can be a pain.

Material in HEPA filters seems thin and is not as high grade as other compatible H13 filters offered!

these fit very well --- better than the other ones I was using. I switched from those because the price went up a lot.  Like other reviewers, I noticed a smell when I first installed.  It did go away, but not sure I'd buy these again.

Price is wonderful

These filters were less expensive than the manufacturer's version.  They fit correctly in my HPA300.  No issues. Well, maybe one little thing would be that since they arrive folded (the large back piece) they need a bit of time to get the fold out of them.  I like that I have three of the black charcoal filters.  I know everyone's life is different.  My air purifier often gets full of dog and bunny hair.  Weekly I vacuum the black filter to ensure proper airflow.  I've taken to replacing all filters once a year and the charcoal one twice a year.  It works for us.

The filters fit perfect but my only problem is the change filter light won’t go off do now I’m paranoid because I won’t know when to change the filters again . It’s been 3months and I’m ordering the original filters from Honeywell so basically I wasted my money on the one that cost half the price

Quality seems very similar to the original manufacture filters. Honestly, can’t tell any difference aside from the price is quite a bit cheaper :)

My order was received in a timely fashion. I had a bit of a problem inserting the 2 white filters that are installed vertically (they seemed to be a bit larger than the space). But, after a little finagling I got them in. Other than that I was very pleased with the product and now my air purifier is up and running again. I will order again.

This filter set is for the HPA 300 room air cleaner. While all air cleaners are not really very good, Consumer Reports listed this as one of the best. We like the unit but the filters are very expensive and like printer ink, the consumables are the "real" cost. Installation is easy and this package is very user friendly.

These fit as well as the more expensive ones but the one difference I noticed was that these have less pleats in the filter than the more expensive ones. Not sure how much this affects filtering performance but just something noted.

We received our filters and they are great.  The pre-filter though came in a huge sheet and I had to cut it down to size to fit.  This could be a production issue but I have plenty of material to get thru the year supply.

Fits my 5500-2 snugly / like OEM.The carbon filter has a slightly higher fill rate compared to OEM (maybe 80% of each hexagon is filled whereas OEM is 65%) however the carbon pellets are around half the size. Not sure if this is good or bad. It appears to allow enough airflow through the filter which is good.The HEPA filter seemed a little thin but air quality measurements from a cheap sensor appear to show improvements.Overall seems like a pretty solid 3rd party replacement option.

These filters are great when replacing the brand name filters. I have multiple purifiers in my home and they all take different filters. I have been very happy with how well they fit and how much money I save when buying the generic brand. I always purchase them on Amazon because they are easy to search for with no problems.

I’ve tried a couple of different brands for filter swaps on my winix 5500-2 model purifier and this is by far the best fitting filter set on the market. The carbon filter build quality is leagues better than others I’ve tried and it fits super snug (others tend to leave a gap at the edges or fit loose). The paper filter itself has wider gaps than others I’ve tried which I believe would make it harder to trap dust and dirt, but easier to clean off.

This fit our unit perfectly and was priced really well!

I've been using these filters for four years, and they work very well with our Winix 5500-2. As of September 2024, you can get four filters for $26, which is fantastic, and depending on your home's dust/pollutant count, the filters can last anywhere from 3 months to six months. For best results, you should probably change them per the manufacturer guidelines, but if you're desperate to stretch a buck, so long as you're on top of the pre-filter cleaning, and you can properly dust off your charcoal filter with a HIGH POWER electric duster, you should get some decent results out of these.

I run two of the Winx 5500-2 24X7.  My wife has many allergies so it critical we have clean air and these filters need to be changed on a regular basis.  This is a great deal to keep me stocked.  Fit seems to be great and no issues thus far.

Installing the 5500-2 Air Purifier Filter Replacement was a breeze—simply pop it in, and it’s set to go, fitting perfectly into my Winix air purifier. The previous filter was due for a change, and immediately upon installation, I could tell the air quality had improved; it was definitely time for a refresh.Price-wise, I did some shopping around and found that this 4-pack offered one of the better deals available online, making it an economical choice without compromising quality. In terms of performance, I can’t distinguish between these filters and the original Winix filters, which speaks volumes about their effectiveness in cleaning the air just as well as the brand-name ones.For anyone using the Winix 5500-2 or AM80 air purifiers, I’d highly recommend these replacement filters. They're a reliable and cost-effective option that doesn’t skimp on quality or functionality. Whether you’re dealing with dust, pollen, or other allergens, these filters handle it all seamlessly.

The quality of the product is sturdy and last a longer time than the generic products.Also easy to use.

Very  happy with this product

Thus I go through a lot of the actual filter elements. Although I'm unable to test the efficacy of a non EOM element, they seem to do as well as the original Winix elements but at ~1/4 the price. They fit just as well as the original Winix elements and they are an excellent money saver.These Winix filters are Hepa 13 (filtering particles down to 0.3 microns) and if you actually need a hospital grade Hepa 14 unit, (filtering particles down to 0.1 microns) the only units I have found are the Puroair ones sold here by Amazon. Both the Winix and Puroair filters are superior to all others I have compared them to and Amazon sells both.

This is supposed to replace a Winix Filter H #116130. Ive attached 3 pictures showing that the HEPA filter as well as the activated charcoal prefilter are both significantly too small (as well as thinner than an original, or even other aftermarket brands.) Obviously letting large amounts of unfiltered air theough the air purifier. Disappointed, but maybe I should've known better for the price.

Upon opening, could tell item had been retuned as packaging was re-taped and inner plastic wrap on filters was opened. The “new” Hepa filter was dirty and had black dust throughout it. Looked to have been very used. Returning. What a disappointment!

I never experienced so much off gassing from a filter before. It smells toxic and defeats the purpose of cleaning the air.

They worked fine initially, but after about 2 months of only occasional use they are giving off a burnt(?) smell. Definitely not worth it. Also, the carbon filter sheds a lot of fine carbon dust.

Does not fit AM80. Cheap garbage that I am returning.

Purchased this product because of price and also because it stated it was compatible. Unfortunately I spent money, put it in the machine to test it out and it doesn’t work. Waste of funds

Filter was defective.  It was longer on 1 side than the other causing it to buckle when inserted (see 3  photos)

I bought this thinking it would be a good replacement for original filter. Don’t waste your money. Didn’t even last a month. It’s just my husband and me. Our house is regularly cleaned. There’s no reason for this to have happened! Sending back

Went to wash charcoal filter and soap and water will not go through filter even high pressure from the water the water hose. If water can't get through how can the air? PURE TRASH!

I have replaced the filters with these new ones and they came half broken. Now the smoke is in my apartment. Don’t buy!

I purchased this item, but my red light is still indicating that I need to replace filter.

DO NOT BUY

My machine stoped working saying it’s the wrong filters

Purchased this filter in January 2021. Worked well with no issues until June 2021. Air purifier began sounding different, making baffle noises and air flow coming out of top was a lot less than when filter was new. Will be going back to the genuine filter because they actually last a full year as advertised.

Disappointed that upon opening the charcoal filter and placing into my machine the black charcoal started turning the filter black.

I will not purchase again.

The white filter fits my Winix 5300-2 decently, but the black carbon filter is too thick as seen from the side view picture. It also restricts air flow and puts too much pressure on the machine. Barely any air flows through then the carbon filter is installed. Also, the red light never turns off when you have the filters installed. *updated description now says it’s only for the Winix 5500*

Not sure why, but relatively soon after installing, purifier shows to change out the filter. 😐

As good a replacement as the name brands!  So far so good!

Not quite the same size but it does work

Nothing exciting here just filters but they do filter

good as OEM product no issues at all...frankly i cant tell the difference

The nuts were a little on the dry side.

Perfect fit to replace the original filter at 1/2 the price of manufacture. Filter arrived in perfect condition with no odd odor that others had commented.

Affordable & fit well!! Buy more.

Charcoal filter was warped a little when zi got it but it still fit!

I al a firm believer in saving money by buying knockoffs versus OEM.  In retrospect though I wish I would have bought the OEM version of theJRPA  filters for my green air encore.  Somethings are just worth the extra money in this case just knowing that I bought the best Bersion available on the market is worth the peace of mind alone.  How do I know the OEM version is better I don’t but the carbon granules on the OEM version is of much greater size allowing fir better absorption of VOC’z and that’s enough for me that in  the future I will spend the extra $10 and get the one I know is made for my unit to perform to its fullest.... so the question fir you is are you willing to spend $10 more even if you are satisfied with this filter....

For the same price as the winix brand filters you get MUCH better filtration from these, the airflow does suffer a little, but not enough to strain the blower motor or stress at all over. These filters are great and I will never purchase the brand name or intended filters again after using these off-brand "gamble purchase" brands filters here. A+ product, though a little on the pricey side now I noticed. I purchase a year ago for $19.99 I believe. Still a better filter than the winix OEM filters though at any price, and is noticeable when cleaning compared to them👍

Fit of plastic frame of paper component required a little trim to fit, otherwise ,as advertised.

Does the job but the purifier definitely sounds different now.

The charcoal filter can be washed and lasts longer than the hepa. So for that, they should sell each separately.

As advertised

The new filter caused change filter light to come on once but since I reset it no problems. Would proubly buy this again.

Fit exactly like the OEM filter, and quality of the materials seemed just as good as well. One star off for a bit more charcoal in filter which at first I thought was a good thing, but on high you can tell unit works a bit harder to suck air.  All in all will buy again in a year when I have to buy a new filter.

These are great replacement for the money however I did notice the hepa filter had to be replaced slightly sooner then the original winix filters

Hepa filter is not as dense as the original version but it should hold up for a year.

Fits perfect. Compared to OEM, I can hear the fan working harder which means airflow is more restrictive. However, given the price of the filter, it’s worth it.

Good value and build quality, but it produced a hint of a plastic smell for the first couple of days since the installation.

Used for room air filtrationA bit expensiveWhat is sheerness?

Good replacement for my Winix. Wish it was a little more affordable. Needs to know if this is recyclable.

Perfect match. Will purchase again.

Seems to be working ok.  No issues with it.

A bit hard to get air through if you’re attaching to a regular fan.

Effective does the job ans easy to install

Very good filter but does lower airflow marginally

Easy simple replacement not as thick as original but does the job well.

Fit right in no problem

Nice high quality carbon pre filter.

Easy to install

Good filters, Great deal!

Solid replacement

I was really surprised by the price of OEM replacement filters. This isn't rocket science, it is filter technology that has been around for 50 years. The HEPA and activated carbon filters fit just like the originals and the price, while still high for what you get, is acceptable.

Very easy to install. Completed task under a min. Cost effective. Arrived promptly and intact. As for the filter efficiency, it is difficult for me to tell unless I have some kind of professional device (I haven’t noticed a significant reduction in dust but my old house is dusty in the first place) but  my Winix does seem to be running stronger.

The price is right and the product is look good. Fit the machine just right.

Filters fit well, and they do clean the air

Perfect fit for my unit.

I love this product it works well with my WINIX air purifier.

I used for a Winix air purifier

Lasts as long as oem filters. Much cheaper. Filters the air just fine. I replace these about every 6 months and vacuum the pre filter twice a month.

It’s really helped the air quality in my apartment.

Sorry my previous review said there were only three filters in the box. That is not correct. I received all four.

Items as described. Shipped fast and in appropriate box very sturdy. Very pleased.

this hose fit perfect, happy with my purchase

A nice price.

I used for coupleMonths and when pull off to change screen you see what you would of been breathing!! It makes you need this and wondering why I didn't have one years ago .very cool the way it works too . You can see if anything is different smoke bug spray then turns red untill air is clean and you noticed parts of the house that had dust everywhere that you don't have to clean that much. I would get one right away

I've purchased two of these replacements, and they perform on par with the original Winix filters, yet are much more affordable. You essentially receive three additional filters at no extra charge, compared to the single Winix filter priced at about $40. These filters excel at trapping dust and neutralizing smells. I have absolutely no issues with them and strongly endorse their use. My model is the Winix 5500-2, which comes with a remote control.

This is a perfect replacement filter that fits and performs just as good as the original manufacturer's replacement filter, at a much lower cost.  Highly recommended.

I was concerned about the filters being the correct size since there are other reviews that stated they were too small or too large and/or damaged. My filters are Perfect!! Packaged in 2 boxes which kept them safe from damage and they fit my Winix to a T. Thanks to this seller; will buy from them again.

I purchased the product without realizing that it fills 100% of the carbon filter. Better than OEM and another manufacturers replacement set I recently purchased.

I've previously always ordered the OEM filters and wanted to compare these against them given the price to see if they measure up.For the carbon filter, the plastic frame appears identical to the OEM version.  As described in the description there is a lot more carbon pellets in this product.  Visually it looked like each hexagon had about 50% more pellets.  I used a kitchen scale and found that the OEM filter weighed 681 grams and this product weighed 943 grams - 38% heavier. I did notice that the mesh appeared to be a slightly tighter weave than the OEM.For the HEPA filter, the construction appears identical -- same size, same number of pleats, and same number and placement of vertical seams.  The fabric appears slightly different and the printing of the air flow direction is different.  But overall the filter visually appears similar to the OEM filter.My OEM filter was purchased 8 months ago so there could be some changes in one bought today.  But ultimately it looks like these replacement filters are similar quality and construction, and has even more carbon.  This could potentially restrict air flow a bit but I use mine to absorb pet odors near a cat box and am happy to have a little less airflow through the filters if it absorbs more odors.

Replacing our old filters was quick and easy, fits perfect

great product

Some reviews say that it has fitment problems - this is false. This filter is actually better than the original and there is no performance degradation. Recommend this product

It's it's my purifier like a glove to a hand OEM specifications at a fraction of the price

Arrived within 2days

We run two Winix air purifiers on our glass porch whenever we're out there. After buying "the best" and being hugely under impressed, I ordered the first Winix for less than a third of what "the best" cost. We have a resident cigar smoker here--so an underperforming purifier left me gasping and smelling like a tavern. What a difference! How I wish we'd started out with a Winix--or two! We were so impressed, I immediately ordered another for the other end of the room (where I sit). Of course, the filters have to be changed more often than those used in a non-smoking environment. Having two--their brand-name set would be pricey. This set comes with the paper (non-washable) filter and the charcoal prefilter--but not the original gauzy washable pre-pre-filter. When I smell smoke on the porch, I wash the pre-pre- and the pre--and we're back to fresh air. When the paper filter gets brown, time to order more. A tip here--save the charcoal pre-filter for when you wash the current pre-filter because you should not put in it back in wet. When you wash it the first time, a lot of charcoal dust goes down the drain--once it rinses without a tinge of black, it will smell like new. It would be fabulous if the paper filter were washable--but then I guess it wouldn't be a hepa filter. When I write reviews, I try to be honest about whether I would buy an item again if it quit working for whatever reason. I would purchase the Winix (the model with the remote--which will work on however many you have) and these discount filters.

Came in a double protective box and fit just perfect

These filters fit my air purifier perfectly and extremely inexpensive!!

These filters compare favorably with the original/official Winix filters. No substantial difference in quality, same size/thickness. They don't include the black part of the filter set, but given that I've never found the carbon to make that big a difference, I really couldn't care less. Leave the existing black part in place (since it has to be there for the filter to operate correctly) and move on, happy with your savings. The official sets are a fortune! Will buy again when needed.

Lasts the 12 mos for us and we have a dusty house and animals. This is the second time ordering this product. I recommend it.

Exact fit air filter. Great air cleaning.

Needed replacement ordered this brand it was perfect fit, no smell worked just as good as original. We are very happy with purchase and would buy again for sure.  It’s been working great ever since we replaced. No Problems, Great Quality

This is the second set of these filters. They are as good or better than the ones that came with the original unit

Update: they were quick to remedy this situation. I got new filters within the same week in perfect condition. Will buy from them continually ✨Original complaint: I love this system but I’m very disappointed with the carbon filter. How does something like this make it past inspection?? Can’t help but wonder if it will damage my air purifier. Guess I’ll find out soon enough..

Was a perfect fit

Comes with both items pictured. Easily installed and fit perfectly for my purifier as listed in the description. My winix purifier started running more quietly once I installed the new filter. I can definitely tell the difference. Only comes with one set. These are cheapest filters available at the time I purchased. I don't see any difference between the filter that came with my purifier and the one I received online. I can usually replace mine every 3 months but that is just me. If your device is running loudly I recommend changing your filter.

These filters are great with filtration and airborne particles.  Very satisfied.

These are great…a friend gifted me their Winix 5500 air purifier when they moved out of state but the filters definitely needed to be replaced.These fit perfectly in my Winix 5500, exactly the same size as the originals…no gaps, HEPA filter just as tightly corrugated as the stock and as mentioned in many reviews the carbon filter seemed to have more carbon particles.Reading some review here I thought I might see some carbon dust initially when turning the unit on but there was none.The Winex doesn’t seem to be running harder/louder with the more filled carbon filter.Excellent product!  Will buy again when I need it!

Great!

Same specifications as the original filters at a much better price. I highly recommend.

They do the job. They purify the air good. I'm going to order more. No department store has them. I knew Amozon did because they have anything you need😊

Popped it in. It filters.

These served as a great replacement. The charcoal filter weighs more and visibly contains much more material than the OEM filter and the second filter was in no way visibly different. Has been working just as well as the original filter, but much cheaper. Hoping for a sale where we will stock up.

Works great. Fits perfectly in air purifier

I bought these filters in bulk and Amazon has a great price for them. I use these in three different air purifiers in the house. No complaints here.

Thrifted my purifier and needed new filters. They fit perfectly!

Pleated filter fits fine. As good as original.Washable filter does not fit but can be cut to fit.Good value but disappointed in the washable filter.

Produt met my expectations. Perfect fit fir my air purifier and reasonably priced

Filters for perfect and came with additional filters. Works great

These replacement filters do an excellent job of eliminating dust and odors from the environment.  The price is reasonable, they are easy to install, and they are durable.

These work perfectly in my filter and I will order more.

The carbon pre-filters don't have a way to stay in place in front of the HEPA filters.I had to had glue the edges of the pre-filters to the hepa filters for proper functioning of my Holmes air purifier.Other buyers will have the same issue.

We have used these filters for about 1 year, we find them excellent for taking out those items you don't want floating around.

These are direct replacement filters for my unit and they fit yes, but loose as heck. They do nit create a good seal on the back side so dust goes around them. They work but not well. Sorry for honesty.

Have not installed filter because they are ruined. I opened mail box to find torn paper bag holding crushed filters. Looked like had been dropped from a plane.

This is how they arrive - there’s no packaging so they get smushed in transit. Terrible quality better off buying the real Holmes for ten dollars more.

I bought it because I needed to change my filters. 1 month after I used it my air purifier stop working for no reason. It never happened before and my purifier is actually 6 months old. I’m so frustrated and upset that this happened to my purifier.

Thought this would work. It doesn’t. I will not buy again.

Very disappointed. The filters have a scent like Febreze - so I am returning. I do not want scented air purifiers, which is a oxymoron.

It came damaged.

They were too small for the model I ordered them for. Specifications stated they’d for my model. Not happy.

The size is way off even though the model number was correct.

Garbage

I bought this filter 2-pack because I couldn't find the original factory filters anywhere at the time of my order and the price seemed reasonable.This wasn't the bargain I'd hoped for. As others have pointed out, the filter paper is clearly not anywhere near the quality of the factory filter. It appears air can bypass the pleated paper where it meets the plastic frame. Over time the inside of the machine will get dirty and need to be disassembled and cleaned out. Not an easy task.It also was shipped in the same box with a holiday gift (a blu-ray box set) which would of been fine, but the filters were in a plastic bag with no box of their own so the pleats were pretty dinged up.I will most definitely pass on this one next time and find a better option.

These have about half the pleats of the Filtrete filter it replaced, which means the filter has a lot less surface area.  So for about half the price you get about half the filter, not exactly a good deal. Less surface area also means the filter won't have as much flow and will lose flow faster as it gets clogged. You're not saving anything by getting these instead of name brand filters.

The plastic frame of the filters have what is presumably a mounting tab for some make(s) of air purifier, however it is not removable and had to be cut off in order for it to fit in my Filtrete machine. One filter had some loose pleats due to an inconsistent adhesive job, though I don’t believe it will affect filtering ability. The black carbon filters lay on top without any means of affixation, but they work better than any other I have tried as far as the filtering of odors! The filters have been in use for over a week and are functionally sound, but are apparently of inconsistent quality, and a bit of a pain to install due to their design.

Don’t buy unless you like wasting money and time.

These are cheap. I found that the filters do not work well. They do not mask the smell. When entering room and machine is off You can smell the dirty filter. This is only after 1 week of use.

Can’t find the name brand filters anymore, so tried these. They are very cheaply made and don’t hold up well. It didn’t last nearly as long as the name brand filters and is super flimsy.

Although these stated they were for my particular air filter, I had to cut a hole in the carbon filter to fit over the dial on the inside.  There is a strange whistling sound coming from my air filter when it is running, both before I cut the hole and after.  They do not fit and conform to the unit.  They are separate and you have to attach it to the other filter and it doesn't work when placing it inside the unit.  So strange.  Sadly this one is in my bedroom so I use it at night.  No way I can stand that sound when trying to sleep!

The product description and graphics should have been my first red flag when getting these filters.They fit my machine but the "activated charcoal" black filters are just plastic, and a lot lower quality than the original.They just don't seem like they do the job, I'd go for something a little more expensive and higher quality.

Certainly no where near the quality of the original quality, I thought they would have been tighter. Almost ripped just removing from packing

Product Description states filter is compatible with Holmes HAP9415 but prefilter does not fit - too small.

These are nice to have. However our came all dented. No box for them. Only a plastic wrap. Interesting!!

The filter itself is just a loose placed piece of Z fold filter material. It almost fell out when I installed it. Pfft

The filter material… flimsy and bent out of shape. And you can’t push it back in The shape its supposed to be in

The filters themselves fit well. The black charcoal pieces are too small so don’t fit properly.

Not as good as previous versions of the same filter.  I was disappointed but have no alternative, so I have to use them.

I didn't have anything heavy combined with this shipment so this was likely mishandled. I think it should still work ok, but I wish it had had some cardboard layer to protect it instead of just plastic wrap to prevent this

I was happy to order these, but they were out of place. I had to try to straighten the filter paper myself.

Filters were of inferior quality wanna order from this company again

The charcoal filter pads did not fit properly. They didn't come with (predrilled) mounting holes for the top and bottom tabs, and they weren't long enough to extend to the bottom ones. So I created my own top mounting holes and it seems to hang fine without attaching to the bottom tabs. The cartridge itself seems to work fine but sometimes I hear a little rattle.

the foam pieces did not cover the whole area

The Hepa filters are identical to the Bionaire Hepa filters and fit well. The charcoal filters do not work at all. My Bionaire has 1 long filter. These filters are too short and too narrow. Now I have to look for the charcoal filter.

Filters seem to be decent but shipped loosely wrapped in plastic so the outer one had the filter material crushed and pulled away from the plastic frame. That one isn't going to filter much with basically a big hole in one end.

The filter fits but the carbon booster filter is very stiff. I won't return this product because it will do for now but I wouldn't purchase it again. Spend a little more and purchase a better product.

Filters were the same as what came with the air purifier. These are sent in a plastic bag and are not boxed though and one was damaged when it was delivered. Have had really good service with these filters in cleaning the air and eliminating any odors.

The folds in the filter material are all messed up. There’s little grooves in the sides of the plastic that the folds are supposed to sit in but many are popped out and I can’t get them back in. But the air purifier still works, I’m just not sure if it works as well with the wrinkly parts.

This was suggested as a replacement filter. I bought it because at the time the price was lower, however, it doesn't fit and the return window has closed.

They DO NOT fit Holmes HAP2415. They seem like they would be decent filters if they fit right. I have mine just sitting in the purifier without being attached. :(

The white filters fit my Holmes machine, but not the black filters. Good price.Item arrived dented in some areas. Tried to move with my fingers to fix it, but it didn’t work.

The filters are great, but the foam filter does not fit.

One of the filters looked like it had been crunched. Going to use it - too much of a hassle to send it back.

There worth the money but it would have been nice if they weren't smashed need to wrap them somehow

A OK

My purchase was for 2 hepa filters and 4 carbon filters. I received only the hepa filters. They appear to be well constructed and fit my AER1. 3 Stars for that. However there was a cheaper option if that was all I wanted. I paid for the carbon filters because I also want to filter out odor.

They were the best I could get for my pocket book

the filter fit, but the black carbon screen are cut to small.

It came with slight damage on the filters.

missing the 4 screens

Just ok. Nothing dpecial

The media could not be loaded.
                



It’s been four days, and I’ve complained to my boyfriend that I couldn’t feel the difference in the air like j could with the original filter when I bought it, like you could SEE stuff going in before, now I can’t see or feel it, but you can see on the filter it’s obviously collecting stuff, so I don’t know. Maybe it’s just like over time ware, your product starts giving up lol

Do not recommend.

Filters worked but just a little smaller then the Aero1 brand. You can't beat the price though.

I have a lot of dust in my so home so Scratch, scratch bad were I have to cover my glasses with plastic. The filter really trap a lot dusk, and not mention I two dogs that shed Extremely large amount of air.  It’s a great price as well. Love it

Very convenient from Amazon. Fast shipping!

This product arrived quickly, fit the application well. It seems to be a good product. Time will tell.

Great value and fits our air purifier perfectly! I’m only giving it 4 stars because due to packaging, one of the filters got a little dented and I had to fit it prior to installation.

Exactly as described

These were alright for my needs. The filters themselves fit well, though took a bit of maneuvering to get them to click into place. They definitely do their job of filtering dust and hair from the air. However, the carbon inserts are not great. They don’t fit the grate on the purifier at all. It took some creative positioning to make it work at all and I still don’t have it all the way to the top as there is no opening for the circle part. Even still, it was worth the money.

Perfect fit

Carbon filter booster was too small,used to purify my bedroom

Arrived on time, no damage aside from one little corner being a little warped on one of the pieces but it doesn't hinder the job and install was easy. Will order more when needed.

Fit my Holmes perfectly and the price was right. Am pleased with my purchase.

I am satisfied with the product. It’s a perfect fit to the air purifier I have. Will buy it again!

Generic version of air filter.  Seems to work, fit the unit, hoping it filters like it supposed to.

It fits, it does what it needs to do, and the fact that I was able to get same day delivery made this pretty awesome. My housemate’s purifier hadn’t been changed in a LONG time and this made the unit run so much quieter.

Only issue was the carbon filter did I not cover the entire back screen. They were a bit short in length.

Found one of my older air cleaners and needed to replace the filters. These were just what I was looking for. Helps with the wild fire smoke that comes in when exiting and entering the house and when the dog goes in and out.

The Filter Replacement for Holmes Air Purifiers work well! I used it during some forest fires when the air quality was really bad and the filter seemed to really work. The main filters fit perfectly and effectively for my 'Holmes aer1 HAP9241'. Only complaint was with the carbon booster filters. It's unclear where and how they should be installed, resulting in a minor fluttering sound.

Everything comes in individual packaging which is great to ensure everything is clean. Filter fills a little flimsy and is not as hard as other filters I’ve used. However after running the air filter it cleans the air very well. It says filter will last about a year and comes with extra charcoal filters so we will see. Would purchase again

Fits & work well. I just prefer the orginal 1 piece blk filter that came with machine instead of one for each individual filter. But they still work great

Noticably better

Pro: it's cheap and it worksCon: poor quality control. the filter fabric arrived partially unglued from the filter and required some time to get back into the frame. I recommend using a pen or something to poke it back into the /\/\/\/\ shaped sides that the filter is originally attached to.

They do the job, but they’re not as good hepa certified, but for the price it’s good

Great price!

Same as my current filter, however, charcoal filter smaller the it should be.Does not cover all of vents.

Fits like it was suppose to seems to be just like the original one

Seriously needs better packaging, mine always arrive crushed! (Filter parts, not the frames).

Works very well and cost is very good

Can't beat this price. The other filters wanted twice amount of money for two filters. Definitely will order more

Fit the purifier

Great filters

It fits the requirements, however,it would had been better if the charcoal filter came in one piece

The quality is not as good as the OEM

Work good

The black little filters are to small. I used the big filters but the original little black filter or whatever it’s called.

black filter too small, used for cigarette smoke

Definitely easy to install.  Filter did come slightly damaged but not enough for it to not work; you get what you pay for. Not protected on a box (sellers box); just put in an Amazon bag.

If you need furnace duct filters these are pretty good for the price. They fit good and seem to do what they are intended to do filter air.

Works great

The product is good as far as I know just started using the air purifier since I go the refill.

I got this filter mostly for the price. It does fit into my old air filter I bought years ago, I don't notice too much of a difference in air quality/fragrance, then again who constantly checks that... So yeah. It does seem to work in terms of filtering air, and catching dust/etc.

You get two filters. The element seems flimsy next to the Aer1 or other filters in that family. But for the price, that’s ok.

Large white and blue filter fits but black thin filter does not fit.

filters fit fine, but the black "things' that came with it did not..

No problem and very good price

easy to work and installation.

I bought these replacement filters twice now because of the new HEPA filter I have for our apartment at home. You can really tell the difference in the air after you use them!

The reason I kept buying from this vendor in the past are based on quality of the filters.My recent purchase is $5 increased in the price and filters are not as good as previous purchases. It still fit in my machine.

Wasn’t exactly the same size as the filter that came with my Holmes air purifier.

The filters were exactly what i expected. air feels fresh & clean.

I bought a small Holmes air cleaner several years ago. The filters are no longer sold locally. I’m very happy that I can still order them on line. The fit was perfect.

Very good

The product came quickly and it fits my machine perfectly

Just what I needed for my Holmes Air Purifier. Thank you.

I like that I got exactly what I ordered.

Works very well

It was accurate

These two packs for my Holmes Air Purifier are a perfect fit! It even comes with black carbon filters. Make sure to follow the instructions on which direction to install it. If you are not careful, it is easy to install it backwards, and it will not shut properly if so.

The filters came a day early, and were exactly as described.

Fits and works great!

Works perfectly in my Holmes tower air cleaner

These filters are looking brand new, I will breathe better.

These fit well on my purifier, they seem to be doing a good job

I change my filters every 3-6 mos.  They definitely make a difference and work great.  I smoke so my air cleaner is often turned up to a 3 and when I check the unit its obvious it cleans well and collects dust etc from the air.

Still works 8 months later!

Great fit & works great.

Loved ease of replacing and also not having to run out to stores to find more filters when it's time to change them!

This filter fits my Holmes AER air purifier perfectly for much more than half the price, and you get 2 with 4 of the charcoal filters!  Such a great deal, wish I would have found this deal a long time ago!

Well made

Great price for the need of my machine, the small filter last about 3 months

I wanted to try a filter for my Holmes Aero and this air filter fits perfectly and works great

These are replacement filters for the air purifier in our bedroom.  The name brand ones are over 2x as much.  These are just as good and do a great job!

Perfect fit and priced way better than in the store.

Fits and has the charcoal filter included.  Will buy more

A great deal on filters. Nicely packaged. Prompt delivery.

the value for this product is very good. It is very easy to install. I have this air cleaner at work  and let it run on low 24/7. At times I would come in early morning and there is a slight unpleasantness about the air quality in the room

fits my machines well.  great price

These filters were purchased for routine change every 3 to 5 months for room air filter machines.

Fits the holmes air purifier hap9423 perfectly and has done a great job cleaning up my bedroom air. Waking up with clear sinuses again is nice.

Works great!

They work well.  Can watch the cig smoke pull right to thru it working its magic

Easy to change out, good value. I keep ordering more

Easy to install in my AER1 desktop air purifier, but cost was a little higher than expected for simple paper filters.  Good quality though.

Yep, seems good to me. It looks like you have to cut the black pre-filter thing to size, but that sounds like a normal thing with the fact this is a semi-universal fit kinda deal.I run the air filter just about constantly in my room and so far it seems like it’s doing just as good with this filter as the first one that was in it.Honestly, I can’t tell if my air filter really does anything or if it’s more of a piece of mind kind of device. I definitely see there is dust accumulated on the filter side, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I would recommend to you reading this (and myself) to go watch some YouTube tester videos to see what’s really happening and how effective these things are.

These are such a great buy. Hard to find these filters in brick and mortar anymore because they banned the machines that use them, well they did in California. Now the machines work just don’t use the ion button. Glad I was able to find these. OEM said change every 12 months but I change them every 6-9 months. Just a preference. Would def buy these filters again n.

We live in the desert Southwest, and spring is windy season so the air filter is used frequently. Wasn't sure these would fit but they did. Quality slightly better than what came with the original unit.

Seems to work. No complaints

High quality replacement HEPA filters and carbon pre-filters.  These fit and work great - just match the size of your OEM filter to these and your good to go.  Filter life has been excellent.  I have purchased this product multiple times.  I use these in both my office and bedroom, along with one in guest rooms.  Filters do their job.

works well in a dusty region. Easy to replace.

Updated review: At first I couldn't tell a difference between these replacement filters and others but they have been installed for about a month now and already need to be replaced (and its not poor air quality speeding up the process). I had bought another brand (Flintar) that lasted 5 months before getting these filters in February. You get what you pay for, I would suggest spending $5 more and going with the Flintar brand.

I noticed it felt and looked different from the original, but still was hopeful. The tab ripped right away. Junk. Not sure why these filters have such good reviews?

I don't usually write reviews but this definitely deserves one! These filters are the absolute worst! It made my whole house smell like pee and smoke and made us sneeze and cough like crazy. Cant afford to buy new ones so will have to just go without

the red light has been on since i installed these filters. not sure what that means.

Seemed to work but when I was trying to adjust the filter and pulled the tab, the filter ripped open, making it useless.

Hay fever doesnt lie. NOT hepa, NOT effective.after sneezing my way through the past week i inspected the thing, doesnt look much like the orginial, net texture is off, and when you hold it up to the light you see its a sham, see through to the other side, not like its supposed to be. This is not an effective filter for dust and dander.if you want a white noise machine, put this filter in

I bought these for me levoit lv h-128 which I purcased from Amazon in June 2023. My the start of October, the white light turned red. These replacement filters did not seem to work. Light is still red. Useless.

I have bought these for the past year with no issues, but this last batch, my throat is now suddenly sore. When I turn off the air purifier, it goes away. Guess the quality went down.Bought a different brand and replaced these. Now I have no issues. Won't be buying again and don't recommend.

I noticed when changing the filter, it seemed to have expanded and tore apart in the machine.  When I went to replace them with the second pair, they were also too tight!

Does not work on purifier, red light will not turn green, although it seems to be the same exact filters that came with purifier.  I do not recommend

The red light is still no air purifier

Item not as described; was incorrect size replacement.

They didn't work with the unit described in the title.  No compatible at all. Don't buy.

Not comparable with the product it says it does

Doesn’t capture as much, better off going with the expensive brand one.

I trusted the high reviews for these replacement filters for my Levoit air purifying unit. Unfortunately, they are not like the ones that came with the actual unit, that can easily be pulled up by the pull tab.I had to apply force to get it into the unit it was that snug.  Which made me wonder if I could pull it back out with the tab, so I tried, and the tab came right off, remaining jammed in my machine.  I could not grab it out with my fingers.  So I had to find something to extricate it (which ended up being the metal emery board on my fingernail clippers that I had to jab into the end put much force into moving it upwards and out).I decided to try the other filter I had also opened to see if it was also snug, and it too was very snug, so I didn't force it all the way down.I personally would not recommend these.I see there are a couple other listings by other off brands claiming to also fit this unit, but I'm not sure I want to take the chance on having a similar experience.  I guess I will just pay the extra money for the real filters.I will now have to ask Amazon if I can send them back for a refund, even though I opened 2 of the 4 filters.

I don't think it is working properly. I usually had quite some dust on the original ones when thé device was working for a while, but with these ones, it looks too clean.. and the button stays red like if there was a problem.I do not recommand.

filters did not last long

not good and cheap product, far away from the original

cant go wrong. these fit great, a great price. work great. all around i love these. i always get excited when i break out a new clean white one. i will continue to buy these for my replacement filters :)

These are really good value as replacement filters. They seem like there's quality made and they do a great job. Much less no cost than buying the name brands plus you get enough to last you for quite a while.

They fit perfectly. Air is much nicer now.

It is just like the one from levoit, authentic and works quietly.

Although these are not made by the actual manufacturer of the air machine I have, they are working great so far.

Perfect fit filters work great

I have been using these to filter smells and dust from my cat's litter box and it has been working wonderfully. No issues so far and it keeps my home smelling clean and fresh.

Good replacement filters, fit perfect.

Ordered these as replacement’s for the original, so far so good!

Good replacement filters good value

These don’t last as long as the brand name filters but they’re still worth it. These last about 5-6 weeks in my house, the brand name ones only last about two weeks longer and are double the price so it makes buying these much more worth it financially and they work just as good in my opinion.

Thinner than expected (but then the slot for them is narrow) but, they do the job.

Excellent product

These filters look exactly the same, but smaller in size than what I need for my model. I made a mistake and have to return these.

The product is compatible with my  Air purifier; however, It is very charcoal heavy and your hands become black just from touching it making it harder to clean it.

It fits really snug in the unit but overall it worked to filter the air in the house.

Left off for a few days and saw the difference in odor and dust settled in the room

No info with product

They do an excellent job and remember to vacuum them every month.  Totally worth the money.

Good stuff

Perfect fit for my levoit small air purifier, good value

I love these better 🗣️

These cost half the price as the official ones and work just as well.

Just as advertised - replacement filter. Arrived in a tiny box and contains 4 packs.

Love the product . Have ordered these filters several times. Great value.

These are just as good as the brand name filters but a fraction of the cost!

I bought a six pack because it's a great price. These fit my LEVOIT Air Purifiers.It also happens they are a near perfect fit for the rectangle opening for the outside intake air of my AC closet. I placed the two side by side and they were about 3/4 of an inch narrow. So I cut 3/4 inch shim to take up the space. My vent provides oxygenated air, but also pollen and other smutz. I have two water proof 12v fans on a timer. Previously, I was using single layer register filters that are little better than a paper towel. These LV-H128 three stage charcoal activated filters are a big improvement. Already, the air from the registers smells cleaner. When the door for the closet starts help latch itself, it's time to change the filter.Along with my LEVOIT Air Purifiers in my bedroom and office, I hope my dusting/vacuum chores will lighten. I'm a terrible housekeeper.

I was having trouble finding replacement filters for my air purifier from where I originally purchased it. I came on Amazon and bought a four pack and they are the same exact ones that the manufacturers website wanted more money for. All in all Amazon saved me money on this purchase. Great pick!

These filters work very well. Just look at the pic, This was after 4 months in my son’s college studio apartment. He said he can breathe better and he’s not stuff the next day. We leave the filtration run 24/7.  We’re going to replace every 2 months and then evaluate. Every situation I’m sure will be different. But these filters work,

I love when they have a sale on these. I use the year round and it not super expensive.

It fits in the Levoit H128, and it visually looks pretty darn close to what filters came with my Levoit. The functional parts look the same, maybe the pull ribbon looks a little different, but from the macro-visual level, it all checks out. If we're all getting scammed and it's not a HEPA filter or charcoal infused or whatever they say....well damn, at least they made a convincing looking product :)But you guys who are complaining that changing out the filter didn't reset the light.... You guys.... You have to reset the light yourself. It's not the filter's fault...For my machine at least, when the machine is off but plugged in and the light is red, you reset the light by press-holding the button for like 10 seconds and then the red light should turn off. But you gotta do that yourself, don't be deducting stars just because you didn't read the owner's manual.

Perfect fit. Does what it’s supposed to do!

I was a little worried because it wasn't from the original seller but fit perfectly

These fit and work with my small air purifiers. Exactly what I needed!

Super easy to install. Great replacement

I’m extremely happy with my purchase.

I purchased the filter replacements to help eliminate dust, pet hair, and other allergens. Does a great job! Will continue to purchase.

A For Awesome!!!

Works as it should. I bought the actual air filter a bit over 6 months ago, and these replacements seem to be slightly different than the ones that came originally. I noticed light passes less through these, they smell a bit different, and the fan seems quieter. I dunno.To reset the red light, press and hold the little touch button for 3 ish seconds, it’ll turn off.

Manufactured for air quality

arrived on time

Easy to replace filters,  great buy.

These fit perfectly and are a great price for 4

This filter is great, works well, and is a perfect replacement besides the second pull tab on the top, besides that I will continue to buy these as long as I have this air purifier. It's honestly quieter than the original

The Levoit filter for this only lasted a month before the red light went on and filter was caked with dust and hair. Although they say only replace with original filters, the filters were just too expensive for one month of use.The 6 pack of these had great reviews, so I took a chance (this model needs 2 filters for the purifier at a time). All other generic filters had mixed reviews.These fit perfectly. They're working great. Held the button to reset and it turned back to green from red.No issues. A great deal for 3 months worth of replacements

Affordable works well

The filters work great. I have this air purifier in my bedroom because I have a long haired cat. It is quiet and the filters absorb all the nasties in the air. They need to be replaced about every 3 months. I always have a spare set on hand!

Small office shared by six employees are air filter does help circulate air in the room. Found these on Amazon, huge savings, then going directly to the manufacturer highly recommend.

Perfect fit.

Fast shipping very pleased

All the things we have purchased from Amazon are the onesAvertised, and are of superior quality!

I do not dislike anything when I wake up I breathe better when I wake up I have less dry mouth and I can breathe better absolutely and it seems like there’s less dust around my house for sure I think it’s an absolutely wonderful product and the filters are literally the size of my motorcycle they’re bigger than my motorcycle filter and I don’t have a little motorcycle set speaks volume and I’ve had it for I think three years and only got one replacement filter for each side it’s crazy I was it has two filters in this little tiny thing and all the other ones are so Big but don’t do take up so much space in the swim so tiny underneath your night stand or end table and nobody knows it’s there and it’s bringing out the trash it’s awesome😊✌️

Install in seconds with minimal effort. Can be cleaned multiple times b4 replaced 2 reduce waste if u have an air compressor! Keeps machine running gr8.

These filters are amazing for my air purifier, and the company that makes them has made the same exact ones to fit the namebrand Purifier replacement filters that are about twice as much and cost.

I needed replacement filters for my Levoit Air purifier & those worked great

The original filters do not work much better at all, compared to these. That makes these way better for the money. Do not listen to the crap reviewers. These are great. The charcoal part of the filter does not leave a charcoal substance behind, it's the same material, don't listen to that. The dust screen actually works better than the original, after using these and comparing with the original. They filter just like HEPA filters should. Very good investment, even if you just have simple once a year seasonal allergies. HEPA filters help a "big ton"

Arrived in good shape. Was concerned that they would not fit properly but they fit perfectly!

Good filter and cost-effective,definitely would buy again

Seem to work well they fit just as OEM.

These have a horrible odor. Im sure it will dissipate but it has a chemical smell. It's been a few hours and still smells.If you hold a name brand replacement filter up toward light you can't see light through the filter material. These I can see straight through them.These are no where near the same filtering capacity as the original. I will buy the original name brand next time which will probably be soon.These just don't have as much filter material so you change it more often. The OEM filter last 4 months in a smokers office. I give this one a month maybe 6 weeks before replacing will be needed.

I had to stop using these. They smelt so bad. Just say no.

I don't know if I got a different product than other reviewers or maybe I have a more discerning eye; but what I received greatly differed from the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) filter. Before I even got the iSingo out of the plastic protection I could tell the mesh on the outside had about double the openess/weave, was loose fitting, and had a very thick doubled (tripled?) up seam. As this is the first layer of protection it's not going to work as well as the OEM. I took pictures of both and you can see for yourself. You can barely see the seam and openess of the mesh on the OEM. I had to feel all the way around the OEM to even find the seam, whereas the seam and mesh openess sticks out visually and tactically on the iSingo. Overall, the quality of construction was lesser then the OEM as well. However, the inner black charcoal filter did look about the same.You get what you pay for when trying to save a buck!

Due to a sickening chemical smell, these are completely useless. Why would I believe this is filtering the air if it smells like that? If anything it's making the air quality worse.

Horrible plastic smell to the point I thought the unit was on fire. Went back to an original filter, and it solved the problem.

I am a little disappointed by the quality of these filters. The outer screen holes are much larger than original and poorly constructed overall. And this is what I can see on the outside. I feel that these are just cheaply made with no intent to meet original filtering capabilities...just that it fits the purifier and even then, I've lost trust that it fits correctly to seal and clean the air.I will not buy this again.

The filters were supposed to fit my model air filter and they do not fit.

I purchased the product expecting authenticity, but it turned out to be a disappointing knock-off. The quality was subpar, and it's clear that it lacks. Save your money and look for originals from Levoit.

These filters let very little air through. They are so restrictive i am worried about them damaging the filter unit.  I am planning on replacing these asap.

Got my 2 pack and ran both of my machines, within an hour house smelled like burning plastic from these filters. Not sure what changed but previously it never did this they must have changed materials. I had to turn machines off to stop the headache my household was getting from these.

Doesn’t filter nearly as well as OEM and is smaller. Disappointed but get what you pay for

Cheap and for filter it does not look well made compared to original

After getting filter could not get filter light to go off, I cleaned inside, unplugged, etc.  I even sent email to Levoit and have yet to receive any response.  Light still on.

My filter light won't turn off anymore since I installed this product.

I recently purchased these replacement filters for my air purifier, and I have to say, my experience has been quite disappointing. After about a month and a half of use with the first filter, I noticed a very strong burning smell coming from the purifier. Concerned, I decided to replace it with another filter, hoping for better results. However, just two weeks later, a subtle burning smell started to emit from the machine again.To troubleshoot, I removed both filters and ran the air purifier without them. Interestingly, there was no burning smell at all during this test, which makes me suspect that the filters are the source of the problem.Based on my experience, I cannot recommend these filters. They simply don’t perform well. I’d suggest going for the branded filters from Levoit instead; I used one of theirs for six months with zero issues and no unpleasant odors. Save yourself the trouble and stick with the reliable option!

I purchased this a while ago and after some time in the filter I smelled a burning smell. I ended up replacing the actual air filter unit thinking it was the machine. After a replacement unit, the filters still smelled like burning.Against better judgement I ordered these again a second time hoping that the first set was defective. Again, the set of filters emit a burning smell.Save your money and buy the real filter

I bough these filters to substitute the old one in the purifier because the red icon appeared. Model is same. Does not work. The purifier shows a red light still to change the filter.

bought these filters, thinking they were equivalent.  they are not.  waste of moneythey emit a burnt plastic smell, especially after a long run of the levoit 200s.  we thought it was the air purifier electronics, and bought a 2nd 200s.  turns out it is these filters.threw them both out and ordered levoit brand filters.

As mentioned by others, the quality of these filters is below that of the original manufacturer filters.The outside mesh has visibly larger opening, which means larger dust particles can enter the HEPA filter (if it even is a true HEPA filter) and thus shorten the life of the filter.I can only assume the rest of the filter is also of lower quality.An immediate return in my book.It's worth paying the extra money for the OEM filter.

These filters emits a chemical odour which makes me  nauseous.The original filters did not have this issue and were amazing. In the garbage. Live and learn.

Burning plastic smell after they run for a normal amount of time. Very strange. Could be also why I haven’t been feeling well.

Did not last as long or filter as well as genuine LeVoit filter. This only lasted 1 month. LeVoit filter lasted 6 months. HUGE difference

The filter seems to work, but the red light does not turn off even after replacing the filter.

Compares to the authentic filters from Levoit,  this one takes more than 5 times longer to get  rid of smell. But the worst part is that it does not filter much dust. I have the air purifier running 24/7 nowadays...  I m going back to buying filters from Levoit.

Needed a more affordable version of the Hepa filters and these have been perfect. They work great, size fits perfectly in our levoit air purifiers throughout the house. And they cling on and hold to the dust and particles making change out of the filters a breeze!

I was initially skeptical about trying these Levoit air purifier filter replacements, but I’m so glad I did! They are just as effective as the name brand version, but at half the price. These filters last just as long and do the trick perfectly, keeping the air in my home clean and fresh. If you’re looking for a cost-effective alternative without compromising on quality, these filters are the way to go. Highly recommended!

I have 2 Husky's so ton of dandruff and poor air quality, therefore a must for a purifier in my bedroom. These are far cheaper than name brand but work just as well.

The filters fit perfectly, came in a package of 3 for the air purifier, well packaged, and cost half of what the company was charging.  A win-win!

Great price for two filters

Perfect fit. Look like they are made by the original manufacturer. Perfect copy. Probably come out of the same factory. Still expensive for what they are, even though they are about half the price of the originals.

Performance seems on par to the OEM filter, with a Great price and value!

good replacement filter, the prefilter mesh is like the original.

Works great just what I ordered with fast delivery

I’ve always bought the brand name filters in the past, but I wanted to figure out a more cost effective solution. These really are just as good as the brand name filters, highly recommend!

Inexpensive and does the job

Fit was perfect, can’t tell if the filter is as good as the original but so far seems to be working fine.

We have the machine in a room with an automated littler machine/box for 2 kittens and this keeps the air machine humming along and the air clean and fresh.  Keep up on your schedule and the machine doing its job with these filters.😁😁

Great filters. Do the job!

The filters look exactly like the originals

There is no reason to spend more on the levoit branded one. You can’t really tell the difference between this one and the original besides the branding stamped on the plastic.

They work as advertised. It is a great product. Highly recommend it for those folks that want to breathe cleaner air at home.

No problems what so ever

Great value for these filters, highly recommend this

They fit perfectly!

The product is excellent

Great

The filters have been doing fine so far.  Air is fresh with no problems.

Purchased these in anticipation of the approaching wildfire season here in the desert southwest. These activated carbon filters should be just the ticket when my area experiences the effects of wildfire smoke.

Great value. Seems to do the trick.

I liked how it was boxed and delivered fast!

Fits perfectly and works great. I cannot tell the difference between this and the original filter that came with my air purifier.

Your money is worth it with this item

Good price, easy to install and delivered quickly.  Yes, buy it.

Great for the price! Exact fit!! Looks like the original that came with the purifier! Works great in catching all the pollutants, dander, fur, dust! Highly recommended!!! Definitely worth the price!!

Perfect fit and good price

Perfect cheaper option for replacement filters. Looks and feels exactly the same as the name brand!! Have bought a few times already!

The media could not be loaded.
                



Same as name brand and does the job just the same! I love these filters!

This item met my expectations

Prompt delivery.

This fits perfectly and got 2 for less than the price of one! Will definitely be getting these as my replacement filters from now on.

Overall: Easy to install and my air purifier is working just like new!Pro: A more affordable option compared to its competitors.Con: Not any that I can think of.

These filters were just what we needed for our air purifier.

The price was great  for  two filters.

GOOD PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING

Worked great in my Levoit core 200s just as the product stated. I loved the value of the 3 pack. Highly recommend these replacement filters :)

Value and price

Fit perfectly. Just like factory filters.

These replacement filters fit perfectly and take no effort to replace with our levoit hepa air filters. The amount of dust and debris that is caught on these is remarkable. A must buy if you have this filter

Would buy again!

Works and fits great!

These are a great substitute for the Leviolt air purifier, the other ones are very expensive and these are just the same. No stinky smell which I was worried about. Would def by again.

It fit perfectly

Perfect fit for my Levoit air purifier.

Looks and acts like the regular filter but at half the price.

It works fine and fits well like oem does. But still better price than oem!

They fit perfectly into my machine

Upon receiving this replacement filter, I placed the original side by side with the replacement.  Sorry to say the replacement is not tall enough to fit properly.  Short about the thickness of two penny, enough to hear it rattle when placed into position and shaken up and down.  It leaves a gap in the air seal at the top which allows air to bypass the filter seal, making the replacement filter completely useless.I cannot vouch if it's HEPA quality as claimed, or even carbon, maybe just black coloring, but if they lie about being a perfect fit replacement (and it isn't), then what else are they lying about.

I returned this item.  It did not work in the LEVOIT Core air purifier.

These are not the high Quality filters, they are the knock off brand.I dislike spending money for the better quality filters to only receive the lesser quality filters.

It doesn't work!

These filters are about 1/8 to a 1/4 too short. They don't make a firm seal at the top. I think it is going to affect (or is that effect) the performance of the air cleaner. May be able to add something to the top to make them work.

Good inexpensive replacement filters for the Levoit. Slight smell probably from packaging but goes away quickly. Not sure if they last as long but hopefully they will.

Cheap Replacement

Replacement filters for air purifiers.

Needed replacement filters and found these and they fit perfectly!

This filter fits perfectly and does a good job at filtering. At least as good as the factory original filter.

Way cheaper than OE it just needs to last at least half as long and I'll be happy

Easy to clean, filters out dust particles, just like the name brand

High quality, works perfect in our air purifier. Gives me 6 months of use and air smells so clean. Easy to put in the air purifier. Great value for the price. Love having fresh air.  It makes no extra noise.

I used this to replace my filter in my air purifier and it works perfectly. The noise is so low you can barely hear it with my purifier. It filters out my living space very well and it gets rid of the cooking odor fast when I use it with my over-top exhaust. It’s a perfect replacement when you need it.

This was a good deal they fit perfectly in my air filters for the bedrooms. They last a while and do their job. I can always tell when they are getting ready to be changed bc my kids start getting stuffy. So they definitely work

Fits perfectly in my air purifier. Very easily to clean

works as needed

High quality, perfect fit. Great for pet dander.

This filter helps pull the allergens out of the air. In all seasons. Of course in the winter it seems to pull more than the summer. I leave it running constantly.  No noise.

I love my air purifier was easy to replace very reasonably in price! Two for the money definitely worth it!

I do love my air purifiers. It was crazy when it was time to change the filter to see how dirty they are. It was like wow these things really do work and the filters I bought for replacement were perfect. They’re not overpriced and they are doing their job is to be a new replacement.

filter replacement

Fits the Levoit Core Mini Air Purifier perfectly.Filter filters as intended.I have made multiple purchases for replacement as I own 4 minis and will order again soon.

this fits perfectly into my levoit air purifier. top quality filter.

With a new filter, the air in my bedroom takes care of dust and dog dander.  I used to wake up with a headache but not with the filter.  I always have my long haired dog sleep with me;  now there is no problem.

Great buy

I purchased these for my Levoit air purifier. They look exactly like the name brand ones but for a way better price.

Second time purchasing these filters, they work great.

Home Depot sells this air purifier in my area but doesn’t sell the replacement filters.Amazon to the rescue! Also, you get two for a great price. Shipped next day, bonus.

My go-to for filters…

Filter is working great

The filters are functioning as they were intended and great price!

The amount of dust and dander this picked up is disgusting. Can definitely tell a difference in our air quality.

It’s quiet & helps a lot.

Easy replacement no issues, seems quality

Worked well and easy to change.

Exactly what I needed.

We ordered these to replace ones in my wife's office air purifier and they fit perfectly. They seem to perform the same quality of purification as we head into the wildfire smoke months out west, our home inside is still clean air. When the time comes I'll definitely order these again.

I order filters pretty regularly for my air purifier. With 3 dogs and a cat, these are a must in my home. They are compatible with the Levoit Core Mini.

Great replacement filter and comes with 6 scent pads that you can add your essential oils to that I didn't even realize came with it! Shipped fast and arrived in good condition,  packed well and easy to use.

We bought this during a smoke advisory from forest fire, and it did make us breath easier while at home.  It's so quiet we have to check it to be sure it's still running. The warning light for when the filter needs to be replaced is a nice feature.  Probably won't be using the fragrance discs, but might give them a try.

Works the same as the expensive name brand, at a lower price.

It fits great & have no issues with it.

I use this for my Levoit mini, they work great.

Works great 👍

Excellent air purifier for small area.

The two pack saved money. Looks just like the original filter.

I like knowing that our air is clean.

Was very easy to install. Perfect fit and like that I got 2, so it made it a better value.

Great fit.  Will buy again.

Kept smelling a burning scent coming from the purifier. I sensed it was coming from the off brand filter. Sure enough it was.

Bought the air filter. Works fine. Never was sent the replacement filters, even though I bought them.

These fit in the unit, but as soon as I started the air filter an awful smell started spreading in the room. Within five minutes I had to put the old filter back in.  I could not stand the smell emanating from these filters. If you want fresh air, buy a different replacement filter.

Seems to be working but misleading as not the brand name I thought I was receiving

Clearly cheaper filters that do not trap as much dust as the OEM products.

Was not an exact fitting match to an actual H13 filter.

These filters are lower quality for sure. You get what you pay for. But if you're looking for something cheap and don't have a serious need for fine filtration, these are for you. The original filter I have for my air purifier, you can't really see through them as much as these. You can see that the density of the black foam is much less density in these than the original Levoit filters. It's also little hard to notice, but the white folds also aren't as dense either, less folds than my original. The white outside sheet seems to also be of lower density than the original. So literally these filters are less dense in every way that counts.  I don't have allergies or a need for maximum filtration so I decided to keep them. They're definitely way cheaper than the original. I bought an air purifier to help with odors and air circulation after I do home improvement projects for when the dust and spray paint odors/particles fly around. I wouldn't know if I trust these for fine particles, mold/mildew, anything much more fine than what you can see superficially floating in the air. I'll give them 3 stars for pricing and still being able to filter out SOMETHING.

This filters are good, the machine is super silent, but for 2 filters  $20 is too high, specially they are not washable and you have to keep buying every 6 months. I tried washing my old ones they somewhat washed, but it's not clean by any means. So, yes, good product, expensive and wasteful. Lot's of waste added to land fields for no reason.

I like the PERSONAL  size for my night table, also the small round filters that can be placed in a Slot - Do what that does is when A few drops of Essential Oil are placed on the pads before inserting into the slot- the results are a nice aroma in my room- Works as stated for about 6 months -However my husband smokes heavily!!!! So the special  filter becomes dark gray ( of course) quickly and the replacement Filters are rather expensive - I cannot get in stores- Only online - Home Depot carries the larger model and sells the filter- but not the one for the  Personal Size-  It works fine for general room size for someone like me without Allergies -

I have only had these for a short while, but I looked at it and it appears to be working.  Hopefully they last.

Appears the same in looks, make and use as OEM filter.

was what I exp

These are filters. They fit the machine.I would give 5 starts but said 4 stars because it's hard to know if they were made properly or poorly due to country of origin being known for poor copy products. Price was right though:)

These replacements filters are very good and fits perfectly .

My bedroom air purifier needed a filter change.  I shopped around and I could not find replacement filters anywhere.  So, I ordered them on Amazon and I had them really fast, and at a reasonable price.  The filters do a great job cleaning the air in my bedroom.

This purifier is perfect size for one room, minimal noise & sleek appearance! The filters work great & produce fresh clean air

These fit my air purifier great. I use this in my office. I used to sneeze a lot in my office and notice that has significantly decreased. These filters seem to catch a lot of small dust particles I didn’t see with my eyes. Easy to swap.

This air purifier makes a noticeable difference in air cleanliness. It runs quietly, does not take up much space and the amount of dust/allergens it collects when I vacuum off the filters (weekly) or replace the filters (monthly) is astounding. I don't use or put oils in the tiny sponge dot  compartment as I don't like "fragrance air" because most such oils smell fake or cheap or perfume-ish. My priority is clean air and these purifiers are REALLY good. You'll see they collect a LOT of particle dust even though you cannot "see" it in the air. The result is you do FEEL cleaner air through your lungs and sinuses and you DO feel better. You might tell yourself your AC air ducts are mega-filtered and your home is generally clean and dusted but DO NOT ASSUME anything until you buy one of these air purifiers and see for yourself the amount of stuff they pull out of the air!!!  You don't have to be a sickie to NEED one -- everyone NEEDS cleaner air no matter where they live or their state of health. You'll be glad.

Work perfect.

Fits my levoit air purifiers perfectly. Looks exactly the same as the originals, but much cheaper. Highly recommend

They filter the air

I have a Lenoit mini core air filter. My filters always get here on time. Good quality.  They do just fine.

Smoke removal

Love this product! LEVOIT is wonderful! It takes smoke out of the air and replaces clean air including pet hair & pet smell from cat litter. Love it!!❤️ Wanting more through our the house!

The air cleaner/Filter system is so easy to use. Replacing the filter and scent pads is the same! I’m glad they didn't Skimp on the scent pads especially that you can only Use 1 pad per scent!

Easy and simple to insert

I like that these filters last a long time before needing to buy new. You can vacuum them !

I replaced my dirty one with the new. I found new diffuser sponges in with the new filters, I was even happier.

Same filters for a better deal.

Nothing could be easier or more effective.  My levoit purifier quietly keeps the air fresh and clean.  I just replaced the filter.  They come as 2 in a box and arrived shortly after I ordered them.  They are each wrapped neatly in plastic. The filter was as easy to replace as a coffee pod in a coffee machine.  The 3 stage HEPA filter was truly the best choice for me.

We have a cat and these make the experience so much better I would buy again

Ordered these replacement filters fit perfectly highly satisfied

Included a pack of odor eliminators that gold oils and so forth.

As described

5 stars.  Just as described.

Very good filters

This worked great!!

Same filter from Walmart cost me over $30. Got two here for 1/2 the cost

love this filter for my small office

Very nice and fit my hepa😊

Great filter and a great price!

They are always sooooo dusty when it’s time to replace them

They fit my unit and works great.

This filter is a good filter for my air cleaner!

fits and works

Works great with my air purifier

I'm just excited about having the two 🤗  I feel like I'm sleeping better.

It does a good job of cleaning the air in my small bedroom

I bought these as filter replacements for my leviot mini. They fit perfectly

Perfect fit. Gets the job done. I love the ease of installation.

These filters came quickly and are so easy to install! They caught so much dust I was beating myself up for not getting an air purifier sooner.

Filter looks to be exactly the same size as original. I’ve read others can be a little shorter. It went in easy and seems to be working fine.

Did the job

Worked as advertised.

Even though they are not the name brand filter recommend for my air filter, they fit perfectly and seem to be working just fine.

I repurchased this brand because each filter lasted 7 months.

These air filters work great and the price is great as well.

Fits the mini Levoits perfectly.  Has charcoal layer as well

Much cheaper than the original and fits well

They work just as good as the pricier filters and fit perfectly.

Most of the other off-brand versions of this filter sold on Amazon do not fit well, they're too short by 1/8" to 1/4".  This one is the perfect height.

Use these right by the cat litter box

These work great and I am grateful for them. Thank you!!

Great filtration! I can personally notice a big difference in my homes air quality. Perfect fit.

Good quality and fits the Aroeve air cleaner perfectly. Install is simple and the product works like you would expect.

Good product. Traps alot

Fits just like name brand and works  well

We ordered wrong thing

Good

Just received them , made well.

I am very satisfied with these filters. It keeps the air fresh and clean.

I liked the scent that comes from these filters. The stock filter that came with my Aeroeve seemed to be more restrictive and very hard to tell if it is cleaning the air. After I had installed one of these I have noticed more of a minty scent coming through the Aeroeve, and it seemed to pull more hair and dirt. The machine seems to be a tad more quieter when it is on.

Seems to work, however installing instructions are explained oposite of factory filter, so a little confusing. I just did it the same way as original

The advertisement pictures show the direction of airflow starting from the white/blue pre-filter towards the black charcoal filter. But in the video, the actor takes out and puts in the filter with the charcoal side out, which shows us, the customer, a false way of putting in the filter. What is correct and what is wrong?

So my other filters installed the opposite way, not sure if this one is different but very odd. I try to vacuum the dirt off the filter often. I have 3 big dogs who bring in a lot of dirt and it seems these last about 2 weeks before the red light comes back on. I'm going to try the brand that comes with the model to see how long it lasts for comparison since I can't recall.

Good price for the quality

ok

These will work in your system but they don’t slide in and fit quite as easily as the originals.

It arrived quickly . It fit . Hard to rate a filter

These last a fairly good amount of time in my dog friendly house.

Filters fit perfectly, work well, and are of good construction.

Great price. Get as many as possible

Like the machine so well I bought another … so got extra pack of filters. Still very impressed with this system

These are just slightly too large for the aeropress.  They bubble and cause the aeropress to spurt out the vents during the press.  They also stick together like wet waterlogged newspaper, as if moisture got into them during processing and then they dried.  Stick with the name brand, this company can't measure.

Too small, so grounds get around and into the coffee. Filters come loose because they are too small

This review has been written in two parts.  In the first section I share my initial impressions after experiencing a filter blow-out during a brew.  Not satisfied with that alone, the second section comes after I decided to try and re-create the failure.==========Originally titled: Not recommended for use with Flow Control/Prisma caps. [★★★☆☆]My go-to recipe for light roasts is a modified version of Jonathan Gagné's 10 minute brew, and that was exactly what I brewed first to test these filters. The nature of this recipe often produces a heavily settled coffee bed that needs a bit more pressure to get through the plunge phase.  That has never been a problem... until today.The 'hiss' came early.  Too early, and with too little resistance behind it.  I backed off and looked down to see I had only made it through about 2/3 of the brew chamber.  Pressing again, more hiss.  Truly a first for my.  I shrugged and went about my typical clean-up, but had pause for concern when I removed the cap and noticed the filter not looking quite right.  Took it to the sink, rinsed it off, and found a hole bored clean through it.As I write these thoughts on this, the last day of March 2024, I find myself wondering if I need to go panic-buy a few boxes of branded AeroPress filters, as they are scheduled to raise the price, quite literally, tomorrow.For those of you using the standard cap, these are probably fine.  My calipers read 0.005", same as the branded filters.  Held to the light, these even seem to be of a more consistent thickness and tighter "weave" than the official filter.==========It was at this point in the first draft of this review that I decided to try and reproduce the blow-out without any coffee.  Immediately upon filling the chamber with water I noticed strange white markings in the installed filter.  I held the next filter in line up to the light and noticed nothing out of the ordinary, but the instant I placed it into a glass of water, sure enough, more white markings appeared.  I repeated this process for approximately 12 more filters before the markings finally stopped showing up.  By this point I had also noticed something of a film that had begun to develop in the glass of water I was testing with.  This debris was also present in the coffee mug I had been testing filter blow-out in.  Strange, to say the very least.After testing a few more of the filters I decided to take random samples from throughout the remaining filters, still in the box.  Of the 15ish samples taken, I only found one sample that contained these white markings, and filters on either side of it's location in the stack also had them.At this point, I'm not willing to put these thing anywhere near something I'm going to drink, and I am thankful all of this came about with my first attempt at using them, and not some 200 cups in or something.  It could very well be a big ol' nothingburger, but I'll leave that to folks more brave than I to figure out.

They fit perfect, and do a great job

But I found that they work just as well as the ones that fit perfectly.

I bought the 500-Count Replacement Paper Filters to use in my AeroPress Go coffeemaker.  These filters do the job.  Perfect fit, same brew quality, and generous 500 count.  I'll be looking for the same filters when these get low.

2 of the first 50 I’ve used so far had this random straight edge across them (see picture). Besides that, they’re just ever so slightly too big for an Aero Press - though you can make it work. It’s only a millimeter or something so one edge will have to fold up the side instead of lay flat in the filter cap. It still makes great coffee. At half the cost of Aero Press brand filters, I’d buy them again.

I use an Aero Press style coffee maker and these filters work perfectly. These filters work well in my press coffee maker and they filter out the sediment from the coffee grounds from my cup.

These are slightly larger than Aeropress filters which is a good thing.

The filters that come with the AeroPress fit perfectly. The first set of 500 new filters were not the brand I am reviewing here; however, they helped me understand that now all filters fit perfectly. I will say that this brand fits the AeroPress perfectly! Other than that, they are exactly what you would expect from filters.

My goal is to perfect the AeroPress so I ordered these filters. They work great and are a great price point as well! Will repurchase for more great coffee when I run out.

I’ve been making coffee in a pour over for a long time now. Decided to try the AeroPress because, well because I was in a shopping mood. What a great decision. I use far less coffee for a better tasting cup. It’s easy, less mess, and I really love my new morning, coffee ritual. A great almost mindless shopping purchase.  I bought the paper filters, that are really just small discs, and couldn’t be happier.In fact, I think I need a cup of coffee!

Arrived on time, was like it was described.  They do the job.

Filter quality is fine, but are slightly too large for my AeroPress.

Excellent

Good filter! I grind finely and the grounds do not get through this.

Love these little filters, as the fit perfectly in the air press, great quality, and don’t take up storage space from bulky packaging.

Really great with your favorite specialty coffees. Very easy to use. Better than with a drip coffee maker. No waste of coffee grounds… so your pound of coffee goes a long way… I actually popped in my suitcase with my favorite Coffee.

The aeropress is great! It produces amazing tasting coffee

I use these as an additional filtration barrier in my moka pot.They are very well sized.  Just slightly larger and other brands I have used, which at times have been a bit smaller that i would like.  That come in handy during the removal, discard, clean-up time.

No difference between these and the few that came with the coffee press.

These filters last forever. I also work for my aeropress as well as my mocha espresso pot. They are inexpensive and cheap but do the job well. My last purchase of these lasted me around 3 years.

These are a perfect fit for the 3 c. Moka pot and work exactly as I had hoped.

These work great in my aeropress, and possibly let the coffee through a bit faster than my previous batch of filters. I was initially concerned that the papers are slightly larger than the ones I had been using but there have been no issues. I generally use one paper for the week, rinsing it off between uses, and these filters hold up nicely. I have no complaints and am satisfied with the product!

I like these filters as they do the job the OEM version does without any real difference or taste. I did find they have a bit less resistance when pushing on the plunger. This might be in my head as I found no increase in sediment in the cup after using these for a few days.

The top filter in my picture is the real Aeropress brand filter. If I shuffled them, I would not be able to tell the difference. If you like the Aeropress filters, then there's no reason to pay much more for theirs. These look and work just like the real deal for quite a savings.

These paper filters fit my Aeropress espresso maker perfectly. They worked the same as the name brand filters that I’ve been using nine months. I recommend them.,

These filters fit perfectly and do a great job filtering out the coffee grounds.

I needed more filters for my Aeropress Go and these were half the price of the originals! They work perfectly.

It's not that I dislike it I just opened it today to change the filter and it is the wrong size. Now I'm stuck with it.

This product doesn't fit in my Levoit.  Very frustrating!!!

The product size does not have a exact fit to the core 300 had to put some painters tape on the bottom to create a better seal

Need roReturn doesnt work. SoCheap

Smells like burning plastic….cant return due to not having the manufacturers box anymore. Don’t recommend this brand

The filter does not fit.The filter height is too high for me to put the lid on! I am going to return this ill-fitting product and purchase a genuine filter!

Not sure if they are old or badly made. But returning

these fit the machine yes.but they need changed every 2-3 weeks these do no t last 6 months like the name brand ones do.My daughter has severe asthma so I check the filter every couple days and have had to change these ones twice already in 30 days.keep in mind you get what you pay for!

First problem is that the filter was damaged out of the box but looked like it would still work.  The second problem is that there was no documentation in the box. Nothing that explains how to attach the two sided prefilter. Nothing that indicates which side of the two sided prefilter faces outward. Hope i did it correctly.  Third, you must be sure the prefilter is attached very snugly to the main filter or else it will catch on the housing and makes installation difficult. We will see how well it actually filters the air.

It doesn’t fit

I ordered a couple non-factory filters for my air purifier to see if I could save some money, given how quickly I go through filters. This was one of my less successful orders.The good: This fit my machine and generally looked similar to comparable products. It looked clean and new.The not-so-good: This noticeably made no impact to the pet odors I try to control in the room. I also still had some minor allergy issues normally resolved by using a factory filter. I don’t have a way to measure this to prove it was the filter, but I trust my nose.Overall, this wasn’t an effective product for me.

First of all, I had no idea the Lv 300 air purifier had different type filters. Different colors are for specific need. Before I had the white, it came with the unit. And to be honest; I hadn’t been impressed. I have a 300 in every room in the house and the smaller in all the bathrooms. We have dogs and cats in house. I purchased this air purifier because I was suffering with headaches, stuffiness, swollen eyes, sneezing , never could get rid of the animal smells regardless how often I cleaned, nearly daily, plus layers of dust on everything in spite of dusting every day. A very knowledgeable person recommended this air purifier. This time, I purchased the green replacement filter. So right now it under investigation. That’s only 3 stars .. I’ll post an update if allowed.

Correct model number, but efficiency is different than expected!

The fit was good, very similar to the original filter. However, the odor control was noticeably worse despite this being the "pet" version of the filter. On closer inspection it seems that the carbon layer is much less dense on this product compared to the original levoit filter.

When I replaced the filter, the glue ring came off and it won't work again.

I like that it fits well with my Levoit however the mesh filter openings seem larger than the name brand so not sure if it’s filtering the finer particulates. Time will tell!

My Levoit 300 didn’t recognize the new filter right away even though I said change the filter before putting the new filter in and restarting after locking It back in place. Not sure if it was a good choice to buy another brand

Worked just as claimed.  Fit was perfect.

The OEM filters for the Levoit Core 300 air purifier can be pretty expensive, especially if you are replacing them often about every 3-4 months like they suggest. Thankfully, there are a lot of off brand filters being offered now, at significantly better pricing such as two off-brand filters for the price of one of the brand replacement filters, nuts!This filter is similar to the Levoit Core 300 Pet filter and as of a month in has performed similarly and perfectly without any issues seen so far. There is an outer mesh filter that captures large debris like pet hair for example, then the middle layer is the HEPA filter, and the 3rd inner most layer has the carbon bits that help capture smells. Overall this filter appears to be doing the job just the same as the original filters, at a lot lower cost. Will buy again if it continues to perform without issue.

I have tried a few different 300s filters - I am not sure any of them are actually different from one another (aside from the color / marketing), with the exception of the smoke filter (which I do also have and use). These seem just like my regular white filters. The pros are that they fit the 300s and filter air, which is the bare minimum. They do filter adequately, but again it may as well be a regular filter as it doesn't seem to do anything any differently.

Bought these on a whim to replace the clogged filter no longer doing it's job.Couple weeks in and it's working great! Good value, and we've noticed an improvement in how outer bedroom feels and smells. Not any difference in noise, either.

This filter made a substantial improvement in air quality from the standard filter which came with the Core 300 unit.  Well worth the money

Perfect fit in the purifier.

These filters are perfect for my use!

Great valueSeems same quality as oem

Works well

as advertised..good price, good service

I have been using the LEVOIT air purifier for about 6 months now, but I have been using the regular filter that it comes with. I have three dogs, and I knew I needed to try the filter intended for pets because the machine just wasn't keeping the dust away as good as I had hoped (although it was working very well). After changing to this filter, I have noticed a huge difference and hope to continue seeing less dog hair and dander in my home.

Order came in good condition! Love this purifier.

I have pet’s and even if I had no pet’s I would have to have this wonderful product.  Dust is in the air and collects on everything in your ones home. This takes care of the harmful airborne spores, dust mites etc. I’m so thankful we have this as a choice in caring for our health.

Same quality as original at bargain price. Next day delivery. I always have replacements on hand

The filter seems like any other filter I've had except when I decided to get the "4 in 1" they also sent me the white "outer filter" you see in the picture and you must install it yourself which is just peel and stick on one end.  I got 2 filter and it came with 4 of those white stick on outer filters which to be honest is kinda a turn off. Seems flakey. But other than that is just like the 30$ option. Only time will tell if the additional filter wrap is worth it.

They are great they fit my machine

love the pet filters !

This are peefect for pets. We just wipe everything off regularly and they last a long time.

Will order again

As expected

Places in our two units that we have in our house. They are great and we have them running 100% of the time.

Live with a cleaner nose !

I love the air purifier by Levoit and it is encouraging to see replacement filters at such a fair price.  I'm happy to replace them timely at this price point. Five stars!

Works perfectly. Easy to install.

I had the original that came with the unit and i bought these for smoke smell.  They really work compared to the original!

I have a Clevast Air Purifier. The AP-220 replacement Clevast so longer sells. These filters fit perfectly I plan to stock up on them before they become obsolete.

I live next to a chainsmokers. She tries to smoke outside, but sometimes fails to do so. These filters do a pretty good job of filtering the smoke. You need to have enough units though to do the job.

Best air purifer and replacement filters we have used

Perfect fit and function at a very competitive price.

Love the removable pre filters that this comes with. It allows you to get twice the usage of a single filter without needing to purchase new ones so often. This is a great feature.

Using this machine really makes a difference in the room.

These filters are compatible. Worked like a charm.

Great replacement filter and a great price for the two pack

Great value when buying 2 at one time and they fit perfectly!

Great filters

Scene 1-Living Room: I'm sitting on a couch looking like the "shrug" and "weary face" emojis. I am exasperated after trying several other knock-off brand filters only to realize that they were all subparresulting in vast differences in air quality when compared to the performance of the OEM Levoit brand filters. I was super bummed to think I'd have to continue to pay thru the nose for the original Levoits for all of eternity.Scene 2 - Office Building: While surfing Amazon during work hours, I came across these Levoit Core 300 compatible filters and decided to give another off-brand one last try. Naturally, after previous attempts, I went into this with low expectations...Scene 3 - Back to the Living Room: The box of filters arrived, and like an animal of prey with a fresh kill, I ripped the box to shreds while laughing maniacally. (Too much, you say?...okay. Let's try this again...take 2...) The box had arrived, and I was looking forward to gently opening it and testing out these new filters. The first thing I noticed is they have the exact same look and are the same exact size as the Levoit brand filters. Installation is a breeze (as are all filters for the Core 300). I unscrewed the bottom of the unit and pop this new filter in. I then turned on my purifier. There was no rattling or banging or screeching or buzzing...only the sweet sound of my room being filled with purified air just like it did with the Levoit brand filters. "HELLO!...do you guys smell that!?!", I ask nobody because I'm the only person in the room. "It's the smell of clean, fresh air, free of dander and particulates!", I say to no one again. "Yes!!! I can smell that! The smell of this fresh air almost makes me happier than the smell freshly minted cash!", I reply, because talking to no one seems to be a theme here.Scene 4- Fast motion montage over a span of a week of using these new off-brand filters: I have yet to notice any comparable differences from the OEM Levoit brand filters in the behavior of my purifier or the quality of the air. In the last scene of the montage, I have just reached the very top of my staircase. I jump around like Rocky Balboa and proclaim, "Thank you, off brand filters!" after not having dropped a single Kleenex or sneezed once during the grueling townhouse climb.Scene 5 - Ending Sequence - Grand Canyon Donkey Trail Tour: I am riding a donkey into the sunset along with my trusty Levoit Core 300 and its new off brand filters. While breathing freely due to these quality filters keeping my donkey allergies at bay, I look to the skies and exclaim, "Highly recommend!" to anyone within earshot.The End.

These replacement filters are excellent for keeping my air purifier working efficiently. The 3-in-1 filtration system, including activated carbon, ensures that the air remains clean and free of allergens. They are easy to install and last a long time, making them a cost-effective choice for maintaining air quality in my home.

Fit my levoit 300s and works as well as it's original filter.I measured the air flow of an original filter and this filter and found no difference in air flow. If it had flowed more air, it likely wasn't trapping as much pollution and; and flowing less air would have meant it was too restrictive/not as efficient.  Since it flowed the same CFM as the original, it's likely filtering as well as the original.Also, the 300s has a built-in particle counter and it showed no change between the original filter and this filter.So this filter works just as well as the original for a lot less cost.

I have a cat who sheds a lot, I got these to try out if they make a difference compared to the regular white filters. They seem to do the trick and hold tons of dust and fur in.

These are a good quality, no rattle or whistles. No smells when I unpackaged these or with first use. They are picking up lots of dust. I don’t know how the dog/pet ones really compare to standard options, but because my small dog sheds a ton, I thought this would be the better option. I have severe allergies and using an air purifier with a good filter really makes a difference for me, especially with year round allergies in AZ being so bad. None of these filters are super cheap, but you prob wouldn’t want that anyways if you really struggle with allergens. Also, I don’t know that a thinner filter is easier on this type of unit like it is with a standard ac unit, but that might be worth researching to ensure lifespan of your purifier. Overall, I’d purchase these again.

Ordered these because the branded filters are quite expensive. they are the exact same size as the others, and are supposed to be the pet-filtering type.Been using them for a couple of weeks, and so far am satisfied with the performance.

This filters picked up so much dust and allergens, the air even smelled clean

I am glad I gave this brand a chance. These are really well made replacements for the original air filter. The used filter on the bottom pictured here was a regular filter and the yellow one on the top is the Pet Care filter.The filters came well packaged and I wasn't concerned that the product would have gotten damaged in shipping. I am using the box to store the second filter for now. But it is really nice knowing I won't have to buy another one for a while. Great deal to have two in one pack.

I am very pleased with these replacement filters.I've tried other non Levoit brand replacement filters and these are the best so far.They are nearly indistinguishable from the OEM replacements, at an excellent price.These have the same plastic mesh pre-filter as the OEM, rather than the cheap filter paper many others use.The fit and function is perfect. They have no odd smells as some other types do and they effectively reduce room odor and dust, just as they should.I highly recommend these Core 300 replacement filters.

The amount of allergens and dust that they trap is quite amazing. If you have pets this is a must have. I had a regular filter on my Levoit Core 300 but these work so much better because of the pets. If you have a Core 300 I recommend these over the regular filters for pet odors and pet dander. They work great overall for your other allergens. You will be able to tell the difference after the air purifier runs through its cycle. I highly recommend these.

Just like the original OEM filters that came originally. It also smells good compared with the old carbon filter that I tried (that one started smelling moldy). Once I put these in then it cleared up that smell. I had to also wipe down the inside and use air duster but now everything appears back to normal. Thanks!

This is a great set of 2 "pet" filters.  (the yellow ones being able to trap more pet hair apparently, vs the white ones which are normal type.)  I couldn't tell any difference with this, from the one I was replacing it with...so very good sign.  Looks pretty much identical, feels identical, and seems to be exactly the same in all ways.  And...I could smell the difference in air quality immediately...as soon I put this one in....fresh and clean out coming right out the top....excellent.  So these are great, work and fit exactly as they should...and I would definitely recommend.

These replacement filters fit my Levoit Core 300 air purifier perfectly. This is a good value for two filters, which will keep me stocked for a year. These look just like the manufacturer’s filters. I have the Levoit Core 300 in my foster kitten room, so I like using these yellow pet filters in that room.

I use these in my Levoit purifier that uses Core 300 filter refills.They fit perfectly and are about 1/4 the price that I had been paying via subscribe & save.I keep this purifier running 24/7 on my boat to keep the air fresh and love having cheaper filters so i can change them more often.

2 Pack Core 300 Replacement Filter for LEVOIT Core 300 and Core 300S Air Purifiers are a nice alternative to the official filter replacements. The cost is much better and the performance is just as good if not better. I like the pet filter on these. I have two 300s so the two pack is great for me. You can also clean these filters to increase longevity.Recommend

Exactly what I needed for my air purifier! Works like a charm AND it's a two pack!

Perfect fit. Perfect seal. Seams to work great. Air smells clean coming out. I assume this is doing the job. It does seal better then some other 3rd party filters.

These filters are very thin and feel like they they are going to tear when you lift them out of the carafe. I ended up buying the Chemex filters.

Love the price. We were. Using more expensive ones, and these work great. And are half the price.

Bake Choice Pre-folded Natural Unbleached Coffee Filters are great. These filters are sturdy, ensuring a perfect brew every time without any grounds slipping through. I appreciate the natural, unbleached design that doesn't affect the taste of my coffee. The pre-folded feature makes them super convenient and easy to use. I used to buy a different brand in the past that was more expensive, but this one provide a better value for money.

I've been breaking the bank to buy filters for my chemex for far too long.  These filters work just as good and cost half the price.  They hold up well under intense heat, but rip a little bit easier than the chemex filter, but that shouldn't be a problem unless your a weird coffee fiend like me and squeeze the filter out after brewing to get every last drop of coffee.

Love these and we have these filters on our auto order.

I’ve used a few of these filters. They do the job and that’s all that’s important. I think they should be a dollar or 2 cheaper ‘cause they cost as much as Chemex filters

Box provides a nice holder for your filters. Will reorder.

I’m a bit of a coffee snob. I wanted to save a few bucks by buying these cheaper filters, but they simply don’t work as well. They drain too quickly so that the coffee isn’t strong enough and winds up being flavorless. With the Chemex filters, it would take a couple of minutes for the full carafe to filter the water. With these, it drains almost instantly. I spend too much on single-origin beans to not be able to taste the flavor, so I’m going back to Chemex.

Great price but little flimsy!

These filters do what they’re supposed to do. I gave them 4 stars due to the paper dust they shed prior to rinsing— not something I’ve found with Chemex-branded filters, but a minor issue given that these are meant to be rinsed prior to use.

Great filters for Chemex. Love that they’re unbleached and more affordable than other brands.

If it matters to you: these are made in China, not in Canada.  I chose to return my order and order the Chemex brand which is made in the USA.

Unfortunately.  I hate the price of Chemex but you gotta do it

For whatever reason the Chemex brand are just better. These don’t drain well, the paper is flimsy and they leak out of the top. It’s worth the extra money to get the better brand. Especially considering I love my coffee routine in the morning and it just makes it a little messier. Do they work? Yes, but with more hassle.

I only make pour-over cups of coffee, so this i not a new concept, but I don't get these filters.  They are folded like a square napkin.  Do I need a class in how to make this giant square a cone filter?  Apparently so.

I have another batch of off-brand Chemex filters, though they are unfolded and a pain to take out of the package and manage given their large unfolded size. They are also in a very thin plastic wrap that makes them flop around so they are harder to store upright without wedging them between something.In comparison, these are pre-folded and come in a cardboard box that makes them much more manageable, with a lid to help keep ants and etc out of them.I never could find official Chemex filters for a reasonable price, I get the impression they are much thicker and provide a cleaner cup of coffee than these filters, so if your after something to give you Chemex-grade filtering these probably won't fit your needs. These are almost identical in thickness and texture to my cone filters for smaller pour-over systems, just lager so they can fit a Chemex. If your not a fan of Chemex's signature taste and want something more typical though, these should be fine for that. I always rinse my filters, and didnt taste anything unusual in my coffee compared to my other filters.Personally, the form factor and the box make these a good product for -me- and I'm happy with them, though the price is a little high for only 50 filters at about $7.99. That makes it about 16 cents a filter which I suppose is not too bad, though you can certainly beat that with a little luck and patience.

A great, more affordable, option as compared to the oem filters for my chemex. The filter really makes a difference. These result in a cleaner cup than pleated styles.

Great product!

We recently switched to using a pour over coffee carafe. These fit our 10 cup carafe very well. They are sturdy and easy to use. I got a kick out of folding the filters. Our coffee tastes great, very clean.

I like these because you can use them more than once

Works well in our 6 Cup Chemex Carafe.

And not bleached paper, another perfect!  Thanks for having something I can't find local!

Nice coffee filters, work great with no issues! Would buy again.

I have a number of different coffee brewing options at home and in my office and enjoy using my Chemex brewer very much. As with a number of other brewers I have, you can't just use a "regular" coffee filter.These coffee filters work great, they're thick but allow the coffee to seep through easily. I haven't noticed a smell or off taste using these filters.Overall, great filters that will work well for you.

I ordered this pack of 50 Bake Choice Pre-folded Natural Unbleached Coffee Filters to use for filtering photographic chemicals.I sometimes use analog photographic processes that involve chemicals.  Typically, these chemicals get reused.  Sometimes, as they age, the begin to develop crystallization or other impurities.  These impurities can have a negative effect on the process you might be using, so they need to be filtered out.  I've found that the best way to filter most of these chemicals is with coffee filters.The problem with a lot of coffee filters is that they are 1) too small, or 2) not strong enough.  These Bake Choice filters are large enough to fit even my largest funnel.  They are prefolded, so it is relatively easy to get them inside of the funnel.  They are nice and strong, doing a good job with filtration and then not falling apart when I remove them from the funnel to drop them in the trash.  I see no reason why they wouldn't work just as well as for their intended purpose -- making pourover coffee.

I love my Chemex coffee maker, and i use it every day. I have used unfolded filters for a while. You just have to fold them. The trouble is, I haven't had my coffee since I was trying to do this easy origami. So these filters are literally a no-brainer,They fit perfectly and are unbleached. They're a perfect thickness, so they don't break when you lift them out of the Chemex.They help me get coffee into my body about 45 seconds faster - perfect.

It fit in my chemex coffee brewer perfectly. Quality of the coffee filter is great. It's nice and thick. Much more affordable than the original one.

Nice filters, they work as promised. Easy to remove from the box. We're using these with our new pour over device which has a built in in filter so that we have less clean up. Very happy so far.

Good quality chemex style cone filters.  Works exactly as it should, rinse first to get rid of any paper taste and it's ready to go!

I only drink coffee about 2 or 3 times a week, so I make pour overs with a ceramic, single-hole vessel.  They, unfortunately, break.  Huge bummer.  I used them with a 3-hole vessel, and they broke one time of the 3, but I can't recommend them as they are unreliable.  I can say that they are great for nuts/snacks when playing cards!

These are a great fit to my single brewer. However, filters are sometimes stuck together and difficult to separate. Also, these are a bit pricey. I do not see another seller with this size so I will purchase these because they do work overall.

They fit perfectly in my Mr coffee

Used to make coffee

Comes packaged in a fairly plain brown box, and wrapped in plastic inside. My wife was generally pleased with these, but felt they might be just a little shorter than ideal.

I got these for one of those pour over single serve gizmos, but these might be a bit too short to be convenient.  I like a strong cup of coffee, so there isn't much room for both coffee and water in these filters.  It will work if I pour small amounts of water multiple times, but that's kind of a pain.  All in all, kind of 'meh'.  It'll work in a pinch.

The filter paper is real thin, but it works. It works as a nice coffee liner and is durable by keeping the grounds out so the water can pass thoroughly. I don't notice a difference in taste in the coffee at the moment. I love that they are Eco-Friendly so it is good for the Environment.

I ordered these for use with my Kalita Wave dripper.  I usually make a strong cup of coffee (14 oz) with about 26 grams of ground coffee.  These filters wouldn't come close to holding that much coffee and water.  I'm guessing these are intended for a low dose small (e.g., maybe 8 oz or less) cup of coffee.  Other than that, the filter paper is pretty thin but would likely work OK.

Absolutely perfect for my mini coffee maker. I will definitely purchase these again.

Clean and easy to use. Good fit for my xbloom machine.

I was wanting filters for my coffee maker. These were just what I was looking for. It is a single cup maker and has a mesh basket that comes with it, but it's messy to clean out and still allows particles to end up in the cup. These filters were the perfect size and keep all the tiny particles out of my cup.

Works well simple to use.

Needed filters for my Hamilton Beach Scoop coffee maker. One cup side of coffee maker has brass filter but I wanted paper filter for health benefits. These fit just perfect.

Great product. 1 cup serving size

Perfect filter for single serve coffee.

Quality product but small for my setup.  If you use something like what I am showing then I would recommend the next size up.

Perfect size!  I clean them afterwards and make flowers!

I don’t like the screen baskets that came with my coffee maker. They still let the really fine grounds thru. These filters keep the “dredges” out of my coffee.

Ran out of coffee filters for use with my Xbloom studio Omni dripper. These fit exactly like the original and arrived quicker then direct from Xbloom!

Works perfectly for the little one cup coffee makers

These filters fit perfectly into my one cup coffee filter compartment. I didn’t experience any mess, rips, or tears. These are definitely pretty sturdy.

These work as expected, just make sure you are using the right size filter for your coffeemaker. These are for small portable coffeemakers that make 1- 2 cups of coffee.

These coffee filters are a great small size for my portable V60. The paper is pretty thin and you might need to change the grind size if you're used to thicker paper, but overall they worked perfectly for me.

These are great coffee liners! They are perfect for my Mr. Coffee iced coffee machine. They are durable and keep the grounds out and allow enough water to pass.

Works on a few of my flat bottom drippers and do not add any taste to my coffee. Good filters for the price.

BUT, I have no regrets.  This chair is perfect in every way.  I suffer from chronic back pain and the support is amazing!  Before I had a large leather name brand chair and it was nice, but wow, nothing compared to this HumanScale chair.  First, it was the easiest thing in the world to assemble.  It came in two parts...simply slide the chair top on top of the wheel assembly and you're done.  No tools needed and I did it myself.  Second, the chair adjustments are very simple.  I can adjust the chair height, the arm rest height and the depth of the seat.  Super easy.  The reline feature is perfect, the chair is not stiff, and unlike some chairs, I've never felt like I was about to flip backwards.  Third, the mesh seat and back truly conform to my body and unlike chairs with memory foam, this one won't ever sag or ""remember"" the impression which is great!  It's like sitting in a new chair every time.  I've only had this chair one week, so who knows what I'll think in a year, but my first impression is all gold stars!  And it has a 5 year warranty so how can you go wrong!?  I would absolutely recommend this chair to anyone that has a home office, has back issues, or just wants a comfortable chair for their desk.

I've been using an upholstered dining chair instead but after several months into working from home last year, my pre-existing lower back pain flared up very badly.  It was at this point I realized I needed an ergonomic chair that will  provide the right support for my body when I'm sitting at my desk for hours.I bought this chair because of its function and its simplicity.  Although the number of reviews were limited on Amazon, I believe all of them were very positive at the time I bought the chair.  Reviewers from other websites also shared similar opinions about the chair.  Yes, the price is rather exorbitant for a chair but for me, it was worth it because 1) installation was super easy:  place the seat to the wheel base.  That's it.  2)  Clean and minimal design...there's no protruding knobs or levers like on most office chairs, and most importantly 3) comfort.  The mesh seat supports my body well and the seatback supports my lower back well, too.Could there be a cheaper chair that provides similar comfort?  Probably, but for the added feature of a 1-step installation and the minimal design, this chair is worth buying.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

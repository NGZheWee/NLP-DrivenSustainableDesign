We have 6 of them in our office.The new fixed pivots 4 degree are horrible. It doesnt allow enough adjustability. For the bottom row it is not angled enough upwards.  For the top row it is not angled enough down.It appears that they tried to save money and increase margins on the product.  In the process they have ruined the functionality.  I will not buy them again,-2

This version you get now has FIXED angles for the monitors, which is fine if you have another head (or set of eyes) mounted on your chest! The pre-set angles are absolutely horrible. I called the manufacturer to inquire about this and they confirmed dropping the adjustable monitor mounts for this stand. They dont even sell/make the adjustable mounts anymore! The manufacturer did put me onto a couple places that might still have them in stock, which one did, and for another $170.00 for 4 of the adjustable mounts got this stand working like it should. My rating is simple: as is out of the box 1 star, with the adjustable mounts 5 stars.",-1

Widerstand dabei ist einstellbar (aber im voreingestellten Zustand bereits optimal.)* Einfache Montage mit mitgelieferten Inbus-Schlüsseln* Für VESA-Monitorbefestigung sowohl im 10x10cm als auch 7x7cm-FormatNicht so gut:* Halterungen am Standarm sind auch im lose geschraubten Zustand sehr eng und deshalb bei der Erstmontage nur schwer auf den Arm zu schieben.  Ich habe trotz sorgfältigem Aufschieben den schwarzen Lack am oberen Ende komplett zer- und teilweise abgekratzt* Durch die Halterungen gibt es einen Abstand von rund 16cm zwischen Rückseite des Displays und Standarm.  Zum einen schade um den Platz auf dem Schreibtisch, zum anderen braucht der Schreibtisch dann schon eine gewisse Tiefe damit man bei großen Monitoren noch einen komfortablen Abstand von den Monitoren halten kann.* Der Abstand ist auch nicht verstellbar. Wenn das obere Display gerade eingestellt ist (weil auf Augenhöhe) und das untere dementsprechend etwas nach oben gekippt, dann gibt es zwangsweise einen Versatz zwischen Unterkante des oberen und Oberkante des unteren Displays.* Die montierten Monitore sind nur sehr schlecht nach oben und unten verschiebbar. Am besten noch mit zwei Personen.  Ein Hand wird zum los- und festschrauben benötigt ... und dann bitte mit der anderen Hand einen 24-Zoll-Schirm ohne das kleinste Verkanten auf die richtige Position schieben.  Ginge das nicht irgendwie besser (vor allem bei dem Preis) zum Beispiel mit einer Kurbel?* Zur Kabelführung liegen ein paar schwarze Kabelbinder dabei. Naja. Klettbänder oder eine andere Lösung wären praktischer (weil wieder lösbar).",0

You need a 2nd person, or contort your arm or shoulder, to hold the monitor tilt at desired setting.When loosening the tilt bolt, you  *must*  support the monitor or it can crash down without warning -- it's either full tight or full loose -- it doesn't have an intermediate ""high friction"" point.This could all have been avoided if the nut for tilt adjust was held captive in a fixed position, then you'd only need 1 wrench (1 hand) for tighetning the bolt",0

I had to pick up the laptop/monitor part separately since it wasn't available at the time I'd made this purchase and really needed it, but one monitor with a laptop works just fine as it is. It was easy to unpack and put together (it ships 90% constructed).I've always wanted a standing desk but wasn't really satisfied with the either the home-rolled ikea hacks that are out there nor with the size of some solutions like the GeekDesk. This is perfect. It's fairly compact and easy to push out of the way when necessary. The price is a little high, but it's a quality product and well worth it. I also really appreciate the ergonomics of it too.",2

I've had it for two weeks and I love standing.  I am using an exercise ball when I sit. It was easy to put together and easy to use. I haven't figured out the desk adjustment needed when equipment is added. I am using my laptop without the second monitor and I plan on order the conversion kit soon. In the meantime It's slightly harder to raise and lower the desk but it's still doable. I love this desk and wish I ordered it a long time ago. It's not as ugly as I thought it would be either.

Mechanism to switch from seating to standing position is easy and works flawless.  Quality is top notch and it's made from sturdy materials, which makes it quite heavy.  However, in my case it's excellent to know that my toddler can't push it over.  The desk is very solid, after 3 years of usage, no scratches nor chips.  It's build to last your entire working career.  I use a desktop + laptop configuration.  The desktop attaches well to the back of the Ergotron through a bracket, which makes it easy to move it around.  The workstation itself takes very little space, since the table is quite small, but it just doesn't matter since your working on 3 levels, keyboard stand, table, and monitors are separate.",2

Moves to different heights smoothly. There is a bit of final setup, but comes mostly assembled. Keyboard and drawer slides nicely. Monitor arms have some adjustment - vertical slide, two positions for angle and horizontal position on arms. Comes with almost all the tools you need for assembly. Moves around easily, even on carpet. The computer mount is a bit odd, as it uses steel cables rather than a shelf, basket, clamps or something else. I have a micro sized thin client that has standard mount (like the monitors) and wasn't suited for the cables. It worked though. My neck and back are improving daily now that I have this, and bonus, I can be near a window when working and push it out of the way when done as it only needs power and in my case Ethernet cable. (It does NOT come with a power bar, but has the wrap arms to store the power cable for one.) The table part tends to shadow the keyboard in my setup at night, so I may change to an illuminated keyboard or LED light underneath. I am strongly considering another for my personal computer and possibly one for my son since he games a lot and is doing a large part of his schooling at home now.",2

All cables and power brick sit in a nicely desigend cable caddy that is part of this desks design. The caddy could easily fit an NUC micro PC but thats a project for another day.Benith the the table section is a slide away keyboard draw that is stable enough for a heavy handed scramble typist like myself and holds true for the odd FPS gaming session although I'd recomend a decent mouse mat.The unit is very well made and will last for years, it is essentially designed for hospitals but works perfectly if you need a work area that packs away in the corner. It may seem expensive but it is made out of very solid materials and to a quality finish. It was delivered next day thanks to amazon prime and was easy to construct. Actually it comes mostly constructed, you just need to attach the screen mount and the screens. I haven't bothered mounting a PC to the back as I use a laptop on the desk space but it can take full sized workstation like an HP ML115.The wheels are solid and the wheel locks work really well.People thought I was mad choosing this as a working solution until they saw it in action, if you are tight on space but require a multi monitor solution then this works very well, where it really shines is in it's fleability to act as a sitting or standing desk with the added bonus of being easily movable. Some times i just sit in the corner, some times I stand. During the winter months I have even wheeled it infront of my running machine and used it to watch music videos during a workout.For the money nothing offers the freedom, flexibility and solid construction of this desk, at least nothing I have come across.",2

That's what I have.  The keyboard protrudes 14 inches from the typing desk, which makes it impossible to sit in the center knee space for the primary desk.My installation was being done by our IT professional and he was also unable to set a vertical adjustment that fixed it for sitting or standing in a way that it would stay in place.

It has least flexibility where you need it -- being able to pull or push the keyboard/mouse platform. it wont move in height either. ended up bending forward to reach the keyboard as you cant pull it towards yourself and in less than 3 months, ended up with cervicular radiculopathy. had to shell out 1k in physical therapy sessions and endure extreme nerve pain for months together.My Advice - go for a product where you can rest your elbow's on chair/table while you are typing long hours. look for ways where you bring the keyboard to you. not bend for the keyboard.",-2

It is worth every penny ... and in fact was less expensive and better designed than the original station I had seen online last year. Having the shelf for papers, drinks, cell phones or anything you can think of above the keyboard / mouse tray is brilliant! The clamp in the bottom to affix it to my work desk is also very smart as the whole station doesn't move around on me. I love being able to adjust the monitor height independently from the height of the station itself, as I find I want it lower when I'm sitting and higher when I'm standing.This is very easy to use; the convenient handle grip on the front of the upper shelf makes it easy to raise and lower ... and I love that now even sitting at my desk is more ergonomic as I can have the keyboard right at the level I want it, not at whatever level the desk happens to be.And as I work in a call center environment doing transport repair stuff, we are constantly being moved around to different desks (personally I think the only reason they keep reassigning teams to different areas of the floor is to make sure the desks get a good cleaning every 3-6 months! lol), so being able to just up and take this with me to another desk is very efficient.  Many companies will install an 'ergonomic' adjustable shelf for your keyboard (with a doctors' note), but they have to be drilled in to the desk, so when moving you have to wait for the installation guy to remove it from your old desk and re-install it at your new. Not very efficient time-wise.There are no 'locks' or 'cranks' to work on this station. It really is as easy as push/pull to the level you desire. I am literally the envy of everyone at my job, and many are already saving their pennies to get one of their own. My employer also offers benefits related to improving one's health; they reimbursed me for almost half as it falls under the exercise equipment category in our Wellness Program!Pros:easy to usethe ability to stand and stretch and wiggle and dance (if you feel like) while at your deskthe ability to back to sitting at any time without complicated adjustments to makehaving your notepad, pen, coffee and whatever else you like right in front of you-no lost desktop space!being able to easily move it from desk to deskeligible for company's wellness program, so I was reimbursed nearly half the cost!Cons:I don't really see any 'cons', but I will say that putting this together, while not difficult, will be MUCH easier, faster and done better if you do so AT the desk you intend to put it on. I made the mistake of trying to put it together at home before bringing it in and found that since I didn't have a surface I could clamp it to at home (it's not light, as it's what 40 lbs?), I didn't have the leverage needed to install the screws, so my keyboard tray is a little bit shifty ... and as I'd installed the shelf above the tray also while at home I found that once I got in to the office and had it clamped down I didn't have the room anymore to reach the screws on the keyboard tray to tighten them up.I am not bothered by the slight shiftiness of the tray, but I'm sure it would bug others ... so put it all together while it's clamped to something!",2

Lots of issues.  The worst one is one that I might have figured out from the pictures, although they do not show it in an L-Shaped desk configuration with a typing table that adjoins a primary desk.  That's what I have.  The keyboard protrudes 14 inches from the typing desk, which makes it impossible to sit in the center knee space for the primary desk.My installation was being done by our IT professional and he was also unable to set a vertical adjustment that fixed it for sitting or standing in a way that it would stay in place. We spent a lot on the installation before concluding that it will not work. I have returned my order.  Sadly, the product needs more design work.",-2

It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",2

This is great for BOTH sitting and standing and improves ergonomics for both.  It is solid and easy to adjust.  Having the workspace attached is helpful.  For me, the benefits of being able to alternate between sitting and standing include decreased stiffness, increased energy, and easier collaborative conversations while looking at the screen.  It also means that when I do sit, I can do so more ergonomically because I can adjust the keyboard and monitor heights independently.  This is actually a pretty big deal for me because desks are almost always too high and when I'm forced to put my keyboard directly on the desk, my shoulders and neck pay the price in a very big way.  So, not only does this allow me to stand when I like, it also acts as an adjustable keyboard tray when I stand.  If you aren't accustomed to standing at work, I recommend also getting a resilience mat that you can set aside (to allow chair roll) when sitting.",2

When in a cubicle, I simple raised the desk portion. Now at a true desk, I have been using a Veridesk Pro. At 6'2"", that unit required me to place blocks underneath to raise the desk surface to an ergonomic level (elbows at 90degrees.). I purchased this desk mount WorkFit-S model, as well as the tall user kit to raise the monitors. My hope was to reclaim some of my desk and improve the aesthetics. I wish I had looked at Ergotron's website more closely; even their own pictures show this unit to be terrible at ergonomics. There is this one picture where the gentleman pictured has his arms bent at an estimated 40degrees to reach the keyboard. My research (and pain) has that a terrible working position!Pros:Easy to setupEasy to adjust heightSmall footprintGreat height on the monitors (especially with the tall user kit)Allows for terrific seated position posture.Cons:Monitors are fixed. My previous setup used the other mentioned model along with a clamped monitor stand which allowed easy monitor sharing.Desk surface is smallKeyboard mouse surface is much too low for an ergonomically correct standing posture.Overall, I like the way this looks and operates. My coworkers are exclaiming how they've never seen me sit before. I have to explain that I cannot stand with this new setup without hurting my wrists. I am looking at ways to modify it. In my research at the Ergotron's website, I was shocked to see their advertising photos not to be ergonomically correct. I am trying to decide between raising the keyboard up 3-4 inches, or enlarging the desk surface.I attempted to register on the Ergotron website to place my comments in their forum. It's been hours and I'm still waiting for my activation email! My hope is to have a conversation with them about my experience. Others in this community seem to have mentioned the keyboard height as an issue. I think their solution was to sit down. This is not what I would like to do. Sitting down is strange to me after so many standing years.",-1

We are both IT professionals.  I did a bunch of research and it came down to the workfit-a or the workfit-s.  I know someone with a kangaroo, but I needed something for her that took very little effort to lift and the ergatrons fit the bill for that much better.  I thought the s looked sturdier, but she liked the a because it mounted on the back of the desk instead of on the front. I ended up getting both. We got both models with the extra work surface which makes a huge difference in usability and with the dual monitor setup.  I set up the a for her and the s for me.  Both have dual 21"" hp monitors. We use wireless keyboards and mice to simplify the cabling, although I had them set up wired initially and it was not a problem. It just took a little more work.We love both models for different reasons.  I like the s because it is simpler and I think the work surface, which is raised from the keyboard, is a better setup.  She likes the a because the arm gives much more flexibility in motion around the cube. They both work perfectly for what we wanted, something we could use to sit and stand with during the day that take almost no effort to lift and lower.I would recommend the s if you are tight on space and don't need the flexibility of the a. I would recommend the a if you have more room and want the flexibility of side to side motion. We don't have the bow hinge on either, so I can't say how they work, but we could see the benefit for sharing one monitor at an angle without having to have someone stand behind you.My wife sits and stands on and off during the day as her back requires as expected.  I thought I would alternate sitting and standing every other hour to try it out. I find I actually stand pretty much all day long at my station instead. I sit when I go to meetings and eat or after I work out.  I got very inexpensive stand mats (less than $15) and I use mine all of the time and it makes a difference on my feet.  My wife uses it less because it gets in the way when she uses her chair. I have a foot stool I use when I stand to keep one foot propped up on and off and I flip the mat over that when I sit, so it works out well for me.The bottom line is both of these workstations are excellent for our needs. With work surfaces and large keyboard trays, they will each run right at $500 apiece.  I find the benefit of being able to stand and sit well worth it. They are very sturdy, but they do take time to set up correctly. Setup is fairly straightforward with the instructions, but not trivial.  The only issue I had was the holes for the worksurface on the s didn't line up perfectly and took some time working that out. Adjusting the tension on either takes some time, more so on the a, but everything works when you get it right. I find that I keep the keyboard higher than I thought to avoid wrist fatigue, but at the right height, it is not an issue. Getting the cabling right so it is clean and tight also takes time, but it turns out well if you work through it.  If you are a hard typer, the monitors will bounce a little, but I adjusted easily and got used to it.  More tension could reduce that, but I don't find it an issue.The cool factor on both is way up there, particularly the a.  You will get attention.  I wrote this review because I found very little online comparing the two models. I hope you find this useful.",2

I'm feeling far more alert both during and after work. While standing, I'm much more mobile. I no longer need to ""get up and go get coffee."" I can just ""go get coffee."" That might not sound like much, but it's a big difference. While sitting, I'm far more comfortable, since the keyboard and screens are positioned at the correct heights for me.I'm standing about 75% of the day. I didn't need any time to ""ramp up"" to this level, but I'm also on the younger side. I do have a soft mat to stand on, since the office floors are concrete underneath thin carpeting.Set-up was easy, but I took my time to do things cleanly. Took about 90 minutes. They include some channeling for your cables, which was a nice touch. You may want to have a few spare zip-ties though. One tip: wait until the end to attach the writing surface, otherwise, the bracket that holds it down will get in the way of one of the tension adjustment screws. A second tip: have a ratcheting screwdriver with a couple of phillips bits, allen bits, and and sockets handy.The product is sturdy and well-built. A lot of the component parts are plastic, but I don't have any concerns about them breaking. It's made in China, which I'm not enthusiastic about, but there weren't any American alternatives that were similar in design. I considered purchasing one of the Kangaroo series workstations from Ergopro, but it didn't have the clamp to secure it to the desk, or the separate platforms for typing and writing.I've had to do some work at clients' offices these past two weeks as well, where I didn't have the Ergotron. It was miserable, haha. I'm probably going to end up buying another one of these for home, or better yet, convince my company to buy them for the office, so I can take this one back home for personal use. Several colleagues have already shown interest in getting them, so it's a possibility. Remember, if you buy it on your own, that's using post-tax dollars. If you can get your company to buy them, they can probably finagle a bulk discount, and they can use pre-tax dollars on it. It takes small bite out of their bottom line, but definitely pays for itself in productivity boosts, and when each unit is only a few hundred bucks, they can definitely find the budget.",2

This is a bad position because you have to always turn your head to face either the left or the right screen at time. Imagine how much neck pain you develop working in this condition for several hours a day over time. This actually affects your productivity because of how uncomfortable and unbearable it becomes after a while.Conclusion:Workfit Dual monitor stand sounds like such a wonderful idea and I actually fell for it. Considering how expensive it is, it is definitely one of my most regretted purchases after just a few months. I tried to keep using it periodically but finally gave up and gone back to monitors sitting on my desk with a very good chair, and that works way much better.",-2

I went from two small monitors to one large one by getting the single monitor attachment. My biggest problem with it is that you can’t attach a webcam to your monitor because it will shake while you type. When it broke, I was pulling it upwards like I always do and it just launched upwards and made a large crashing sound like it’s internal track system snapped. I attempted to open it up, since it’s so desperately out of warranty, but the screws are very fragile and stripped immediately. I am getting special drill bits to try again, but fear from what I’ve researched that it’s now permanently a standing-only desk, so is no longer practical for my uses.  I always found the tiny desk area to be a bit inadequate, so will be upgrading to a different design that addresses that issue, likely at the expense of the quickness that this design lets you move from sitting to standing. It also doesn’t let you articulate the monitor, which other models allow, so it was not really that ergonomic when sitting down. Nonetheless, I was with it for almost a decade, so will miss it. I will likely forget it’s not there and grab for the now phantom pull handle when I stand up until I register the loss.",-1

The unit is solid and great quality with a smooth operation. One thing I worried about prior to receiving was if the worksurface could be written on without the unit lowering or too much shaking, it works great and is solid. You cannot lean on the desk or it will lower but writing/typing/mouse do not affect it. I also recommend the bow hing like other users, sharing the monitor during an office meeting is invaluable.I was also concerned about the monitors shaking during use. They do move slightly about a millimeter or 2, but it is not at all distracting as I thought it would be.I am 6 ft tall, with my dress shoes and a standing mat I am 6' 3 inches, and I use the tall users kit and it fits even better than before (no I am not an Ergotron salesman). I disagree with the ergo recommendations that say the top of the monitor should be two inches above eye level, I think that is true for sitting, but when standing you will want that sweet spot between where your head rolls forward and rolls back when relaxed. To attain this spot, you will want the center of the monitor at eye level or 2 inches above eye level. I am not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt but I have had standing desks for a year now and found this to be the most comfortable. To attain this height, I think even <6 ft tall users might want the tall users kit.The keyboard max height is the only restriction I have come across, at my height, my hands come down slightly from my elbows to the keyboard which is not recommended. I can angle the keyboard tray but it feels awkward. The keyboard has two preset angles and neither of them fit perfectly, it would have been helpful if the keyboard could raise just a little bit more or fully adjustable keyboard tray. The restriction is really based on the height of the desk you attach to, so if you can raise that desk, you could reach any height you want.Another useful piece of info I could not find anywhere else, you can use the tall users kit on the bow hinge. Also make sure you get a standing mat or your feet will hurt. I had a kitchen version the first time and it flattened out within a few months. I recommend getting one for industrial use.",2

It is worth every penny ... and in fact was less expensive and better designed than the original station I had seen online last year. Having the shelf for papers, drinks, cell phones or anything you can think of above the keyboard / mouse tray is brilliant! The clamp in the bottom to affix it to my work desk is also very smart as the whole station doesn't move around on me. I love being able to adjust the monitor height independently from the height of the station itself, as I find I want it lower when I'm sitting and higher when I'm standing.This is very easy to use; the convenient handle grip on the front of the upper shelf makes it easy to raise and lower ... and I love that now even sitting at my desk is more ergonomic as I can have the keyboard right at the level I want it, not at whatever level the desk happens to be.And as I work in a call center environment doing transport repair stuff, we are constantly being moved around to different desks (personally I think the only reason they keep reassigning teams to different areas of the floor is to make sure the desks get a good cleaning every 3-6 months! lol), so being able to just up and take this with me to another desk is very efficient.  Many companies will install an 'ergonomic' adjustable shelf for your keyboard (with a doctors' note), but they have to be drilled in to the desk, so when moving you have to wait for the installation guy to remove it from your old desk and re-install it at your new. Not very efficient time-wise.There are no 'locks' or 'cranks' to work on this station. It really is as easy as push/pull to the level you desire. I am literally the envy of everyone at my job, and many are already saving their pennies to get one of their own. My employer also offers benefits related to improving one's health; they reimbursed me for almost half as it falls under the exercise equipment category in our Wellness Program!Pros:easy to usethe ability to stand and stretch and wiggle and dance (if you feel like) while at your deskthe ability to back to sitting at any time without complicated adjustments to makehaving your notepad, pen, coffee and whatever else you like right in front of you-no lost desktop space!being able to easily move it from desk to deskeligible for company's wellness program, so I was reimbursed nearly half the cost!Cons:I don't really see any 'cons', but I will say that putting this together, while not difficult, will be MUCH easier, faster and done better if you do so AT the desk you intend to put it on. I made the mistake of trying to put it together at home before bringing it in and found that since I didn't have a surface I could clamp it to at home (it's not light, as it's what 40 lbs?), I didn't have the leverage needed to install the screws, so my keyboard tray is a little bit shifty ... and as I'd installed the shelf above the tray also while at home I found that once I got in to the office and had it clamped down I didn't have the room anymore to reach the screws on the keyboard tray to tighten them up.I am not bothered by the slight shiftiness of the tray, but I'm sure it would bug others ... so put it all together while it's clamped to something!",2

Lots of issues.  The worst one is one that I might have figured out from the pictures, although they do not show it in an L-Shaped desk configuration with a typing table that adjoins a primary desk.  That's what I have.  The keyboard protrudes 14 inches from the typing desk, which makes it impossible to sit in the center knee space for the primary desk.My installation was being done by our IT professional and he was also unable to set a vertical adjustment that fixed it for sitting or standing in a way that it would stay in place.

It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",2

This is great for BOTH sitting and standing and improves ergonomics for both.  It is solid and easy to adjust.  Having the workspace attached is helpful.  For me, the benefits of being able to alternate between sitting and standing include decreased stiffness, increased energy, and easier collaborative conversations while looking at the screen.  It also means that when I do sit, I can do so more ergonomically because I can adjust the keyboard and monitor heights independently.  This is actually a pretty big deal for me because desks are almost always too high and when I'm forced to put my keyboard directly on the desk, my shoulders and neck pay the price in a very big way.  So, not only does this allow me to stand when I like, it also acts as an adjustable keyboard tray when I stand.  If you aren't accustomed to standing at work, I recommend also getting a resilience mat that you can set aside (to allow chair roll) when sitting.",2

When in a cubicle, I simple raised the desk portion. Now at a true desk, I have been using a Veridesk Pro. At 6'2"", that unit required me to place blocks underneath to raise the desk surface to an ergonomic level (elbows at 90degrees.). I purchased this desk mount WorkFit-S model, as well as the tall user kit to raise the monitors. My hope was to reclaim some of my desk and improve the aesthetics. I wish I had looked at Ergotron's website more closely; even their own pictures show this unit to be terrible at ergonomics. There is this one picture where the gentleman pictured has his arms bent at an estimated 40degrees to reach the keyboard. My research (and pain) has that a terrible working position!Pros:Easy to setupEasy to adjust heightSmall footprintGreat height on the monitors (especially with the tall user kit)Allows for terrific seated position posture.Cons:Monitors are fixed. My previous setup used the other mentioned model along with a clamped monitor stand which allowed easy monitor sharing.Desk surface is smallKeyboard mouse surface is much too low for an ergonomically correct standing posture.Overall, I like the way this looks and operates. My coworkers are exclaiming how they've never seen me sit before. I have to explain that I cannot stand with this new setup without hurting my wrists. I am looking at ways to modify it. In my research at the Ergotron's website, I was shocked to see their advertising photos not to be ergonomically correct. I am trying to decide between raising the keyboard up 3-4 inches, or enlarging the desk surface.I attempted to register on the Ergotron website to place my comments in their forum. It's been hours and I'm still waiting for my activation email! My hope is to have a conversation with them about my experience. Others in this community seem to have mentioned the keyboard height as an issue. I think their solution was to sit down. This is not what I would like to do. Sitting down is strange to me after so many standing years.",-1

We are both IT professionals.  I did a bunch of research and it came down to the workfit-a or the workfit-s.  I know someone with a kangaroo, but I needed something for her that took very little effort to lift and the ergatrons fit the bill for that much better.  I thought the s looked sturdier, but she liked the a because it mounted on the back of the desk instead of on the front. I ended up getting both. We got both models with the extra work surface which makes a huge difference in usability and with the dual monitor setup.  I set up the a for her and the s for me.  Both have dual 21"" hp monitors. We use wireless keyboards and mice to simplify the cabling, although I had them set up wired initially and it was not a problem. It just took a little more work.We love both models for different reasons.  I like the s because it is simpler and I think the work surface, which is raised from the keyboard, is a better setup.  She likes the a because the arm gives much more flexibility in motion around the cube. They both work perfectly for what we wanted, something we could use to sit and stand with during the day that take almost no effort to lift and lower.I would recommend the s if you are tight on space and don't need the flexibility of the a. I would recommend the a if you have more room and want the flexibility of side to side motion. We don't have the bow hinge on either, so I can't say how they work, but we could see the benefit for sharing one monitor at an angle without having to have someone stand behind you.My wife sits and stands on and off during the day as her back requires as expected.  I thought I would alternate sitting and standing every other hour to try it out. I find I actually stand pretty much all day long at my station instead. I sit when I go to meetings and eat or after I work out.  I got very inexpensive stand mats (less than $15) and I use mine all of the time and it makes a difference on my feet.  My wife uses it less because it gets in the way when she uses her chair. I have a foot stool I use when I stand to keep one foot propped up on and off and I flip the mat over that when I sit, so it works out well for me.The bottom line is both of these workstations are excellent for our needs. With work surfaces and large keyboard trays, they will each run right at $500 apiece.  I find the benefit of being able to stand and sit well worth it. They are very sturdy, but they do take time to set up correctly. Setup is fairly straightforward with the instructions, but not trivial.  The only issue I had was the holes for the worksurface on the s didn't line up perfectly and took some time working that out. Adjusting the tension on either takes some time, more so on the a, but everything works when you get it right. I find that I keep the keyboard higher than I thought to avoid wrist fatigue, but at the right height, it is not an issue. Getting the cabling right so it is clean and tight also takes time, but it turns out well if you work through it.  If you are a hard typer, the monitors will bounce a little, but I adjusted easily and got used to it.  More tension could reduce that, but I don't find it an issue.The cool factor on both is way up there, particularly the a.  You will get attention.  I wrote this review because I found very little online comparing the two models. I hope you find this useful.",2

I'm feeling far more alert both during and after work. While standing, I'm much more mobile. I no longer need to ""get up and go get coffee."" I can just ""go get coffee."" That might not sound like much, but it's a big difference. While sitting, I'm far more comfortable, since the keyboard and screens are positioned at the correct heights for me.I'm standing about 75% of the day. I didn't need any time to ""ramp up"" to this level, but I'm also on the younger side. I do have a soft mat to stand on, since the office floors are concrete underneath thin carpeting.Set-up was easy, but I took my time to do things cleanly. Took about 90 minutes. They include some channeling for your cables, which was a nice touch. You may want to have a few spare zip-ties though. One tip: wait until the end to attach the writing surface, otherwise, the bracket that holds it down will get in the way of one of the tension adjustment screws. A second tip: have a ratcheting screwdriver with a couple of phillips bits, allen bits, and and sockets handy.The product is sturdy and well-built. A lot of the component parts are plastic, but I don't have any concerns about them breaking. It's made in China, which I'm not enthusiastic about, but there weren't any American alternatives that were similar in design. I considered purchasing one of the Kangaroo series workstations from Ergopro, but it didn't have the clamp to secure it to the desk, or the separate platforms for typing and writing.I've had to do some work at clients' offices these past two weeks as well, where I didn't have the Ergotron. It was miserable, haha. I'm probably going to end up buying another one of these for home, or better yet, convince my company to buy them for the office, so I can take this one back home for personal use. Several colleagues have already shown interest in getting them, so it's a possibility. Remember, if you buy it on your own, that's using post-tax dollars. If you can get your company to buy them, they can probably finagle a bulk discount, and they can use pre-tax dollars on it. It takes small bite out of their bottom line, but definitely pays for itself in productivity boosts, and when each unit is only a few hundred bucks, they can definitely find the budget.",2

I went from two small monitors to one large one by getting the single monitor attachment. My biggest problem with it is that you can’t attach a webcam to your monitor because it will shake while you type. When it broke, I was pulling it upwards like I always do and it just launched upwards and made a large crashing sound like it’s internal track system snapped. I attempted to open it up, since it’s so desperately out of warranty, but the screws are very fragile and stripped immediately. I am getting special drill bits to try again, but fear from what I’ve researched that it’s now permanently a standing-only desk, so is no longer practical for my uses.  I always found the tiny desk area to be a bit inadequate, so will be upgrading to a different design that addresses that issue, likely at the expense of the quickness that this design lets you move from sitting to standing. It also doesn’t let you articulate the monitor, which other models allow, so it was not really that ergonomic when sitting down. Nonetheless, I was with it for almost a decade, so will miss it. I will likely forget it’s not there and grab for the now phantom pull handle when I stand up until I register the loss.",-1

The unit is solid and great quality with a smooth operation. One thing I worried about prior to receiving was if the worksurface could be written on without the unit lowering or too much shaking, it works great and is solid. You cannot lean on the desk or it will lower but writing/typing/mouse do not affect it. I also recommend the bow hing like other users, sharing the monitor during an office meeting is invaluable.I was also concerned about the monitors shaking during use. They do move slightly about a millimeter or 2, but it is not at all distracting as I thought it would be.I am 6 ft tall, with my dress shoes and a standing mat I am 6' 3 inches, and I use the tall users kit and it fits even better than before (no I am not an Ergotron salesman). I disagree with the ergo recommendations that say the top of the monitor should be two inches above eye level, I think that is true for sitting, but when standing you will want that sweet spot between where your head rolls forward and rolls back when relaxed. To attain this spot, you will want the center of the monitor at eye level or 2 inches above eye level. I am not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt but I have had standing desks for a year now and found this to be the most comfortable. To attain this height, I think even <6 ft tall users might want the tall users kit.The keyboard max height is the only restriction I have come across, at my height, my hands come down slightly from my elbows to the keyboard which is not recommended. I can angle the keyboard tray but it feels awkward. The keyboard has two preset angles and neither of them fit perfectly, it would have been helpful if the keyboard could raise just a little bit more or fully adjustable keyboard tray. The restriction is really based on the height of the desk you attach to, so if you can raise that desk, you could reach any height you want.Another useful piece of info I could not find anywhere else, you can use the tall users kit on the bow hinge. Also make sure you get a standing mat or your feet will hurt. I had a kitchen version the first time and it flattened out within a few months. I recommend getting one for industrial use.",2

This is great for BOTH sitting and standing and improves ergonomics for both.  It is solid and easy to adjust.  Having the workspace attached is helpful.  For me, the benefits of being able to alternate between sitting and standing include decreased stiffness, increased energy, and easier collaborative conversations while looking at the screen.  It also means that when I do sit, I can do so more ergonomically because I can adjust the keyboard and monitor heights independently.  This is actually a pretty big deal for me because desks are almost always too high and when I'm forced to put my keyboard directly on the desk, my shoulders and neck pay the price in a very big way.  So, not only does this allow me to stand when I like, it also acts as an adjustable keyboard tray when I stand.  If you aren't accustomed to standing at work, I recommend also getting a resilience mat that you can set aside (to allow chair roll) when sitting.",2

And the shelf really is a great touch, since I can keep small items in reach at all times and have a place handy for signing papers and setting reference materials.Construction went fine--though there was some difficulty with adjusting the tension to the right level, and I have had no real problems with its use.I'd absolutely recommend it to people who can't afford a full-priced adjustable desk.",1

It is not unreasonably unstable, but shakes some when typing on the keyboard. Not a deal breaker though.",1

I just learned this the hard way and am incredibly fortunate my 3-year old is not more seriously injured. He was ""working"" (as mom and dad always do) while I was in another room, and when I heard the crash I came in to find that the entire desk with workstation -- about 100 lbs total -- had tipped over, knocked him out of the chair and pinned him to the ground. Miraculously, he only had a bruise on his arm where the keyboard tray landed on it, but it obviously could have been a lot worse and at the very least created a horrifying image that I don't wish any parent to have to live with as I have these past days. So...***** PLEASE SECURE YOUR DESK OR THE WORKSTATION TO THE WALL!! *******Even if your desk is sturdy or heavy, this workstation is top-heavy and the keyboard tray extending out creates leverage, meaning less weight is needed to topple it. You can see how I secured mine in the photo.Otherwise, it's a great workstation. The jiggles are a little annoying, but I think it's as solid as it could be.",-1

I already had a standup desk, but I liked the Ergotron's easily adjustable feature, where both the keyboard and the screen(s) move in tandem. Installation was very easy; I only needed a philips screwdriver. All other needed tools are provided.Pros: The unit is of very solid construction. And, it is extremely easy to move up and down to adjust for standing and sitting. Plus, I like the neatness of it. The kit comes with a cable wrap material that neatly bundles all of the various chords into a tight harness that descends behind the desk.Cons: I'm tall (6'2""). The tallest setting of the Ergotron seems about 1"" shorter than what I want and need, causing my habitual shoulder-slumping to re-appear. I think I can resolve this, though, with a simple wood shim placed and clamped under the stand.Next con: The default keyboard table is both small and flimsy. I use the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard with 10-key and it barely fits. It actually extends about 3"" into the area of the even-more-flimsy retractable mouse shelf. Thankfully, because I use a trackball mouse, I don't need to move the mouse around. Also, the small keyboard table doesn't leave room for the after-market articulating arm support I use distribution weight from my soulders. To solve all this, I've purchased the optional larger and deeper keyboard tray, which should work fine.Last, the monitors only slide laterally. There is no ability to swivel or adjustability to them, for instance, to show your screen to someone standing in your office to one side.The cons are small issues, in my opinion, when I consider the overall value and utility of the unit - and they are all easily resolved with simple solutions.Overall, I am very happy with this setup.",1

Crosby,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018","I have one of these.  I like it.  I stand up probably 45 minutes of every hour on average.  The platform under the dual monitors was rickety on mine and I had to devise shims to tighten it up.  It's tight as a drum with the shims I put in there. The guy at work next to me got one to, but his didn't need any shims.  I got mine well before him, so maybe this was a problem that Ergotron has fixed. I wish that it would elevate another couple inches, but it's not a deal breaker.  If you're over about 6'2"" you might have to put wood between it and your desk though to get it up to where you need it.",1

It is worth every penny ... and in fact was less expensive and better designed than the original station I had seen online last year. Having the shelf for papers, drinks, cell phones or anything you can think of above the keyboard / mouse tray is brilliant! The clamp in the bottom to affix it to my work desk is also very smart as the whole station doesn't move around on me. I love being able to adjust the monitor height independently from the height of the station itself, as I find I want it lower when I'm sitting and higher when I'm standing.This is very easy to use; the convenient handle grip on the front of the upper shelf makes it easy to raise and lower ... and I love that now even sitting at my desk is more ergonomic as I can have the keyboard right at the level I want it, not at whatever level the desk happens to be.And as I work in a call center environment doing transport repair stuff, we are constantly being moved around to different desks (personally I think the only reason they keep reassigning teams to different areas of the floor is to make sure the desks get a good cleaning every 3-6 months! lol), so being able to just up and take this with me to another desk is very efficient.  Many companies will install an 'ergonomic' adjustable shelf for your keyboard (with a doctors' note), but they have to be drilled in to the desk, so when moving you have to wait for the installation guy to remove it from your old desk and re-install it at your new. Not very efficient time-wise.There are no 'locks' or 'cranks' to work on this station. It really is as easy as push/pull to the level you desire. I am literally the envy of everyone at my job, and many are already saving their pennies to get one of their own. My employer also offers benefits related to improving one's health; they reimbursed me for almost half as it falls under the exercise equipment category in our Wellness Program!Pros:easy to usethe ability to stand and stretch and wiggle and dance (if you feel like) while at your deskthe ability to back to sitting at any time without complicated adjustments to makehaving your notepad, pen, coffee and whatever else you like right in front of you-no lost desktop space!being able to easily move it from desk to deskeligible for company's wellness program, so I was reimbursed nearly half the cost!Cons:I don't really see any 'cons', but I will say that putting this together, while not difficult, will be MUCH easier, faster and done better if you do so AT the desk you intend to put it on. I made the mistake of trying to put it together at home before bringing it in and found that since I didn't have a surface I could clamp it to at home (it's not light, as it's what 40 lbs?), I didn't have the leverage needed to install the screws, so my keyboard tray is a little bit shifty ... and as I'd installed the shelf above the tray also while at home I found that once I got in to the office and had it clamped down I didn't have the room anymore to reach the screws on the keyboard tray to tighten them up.I am not bothered by the slight shiftiness of the tray, but I'm sure it would bug others ... so put it all together while it's clamped to something!",2

It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",2

We are both IT professionals.  I did a bunch of research and it came down to the workfit-a or the workfit-s.  I know someone with a kangaroo, but I needed something for her that took very little effort to lift and the ergatrons fit the bill for that much better.  I thought the s looked sturdier, but she liked the a because it mounted on the back of the desk instead of on the front. I ended up getting both. We got both models with the extra work surface which makes a huge difference in usability and with the dual monitor setup.  I set up the a for her and the s for me.  Both have dual 21"" hp monitors. We use wireless keyboards and mice to simplify the cabling, although I had them set up wired initially and it was not a problem. It just took a little more work.We love both models for different reasons.  I like the s because it is simpler and I think the work surface, which is raised from the keyboard, is a better setup.  She likes the a because the arm gives much more flexibility in motion around the cube. They both work perfectly for what we wanted, something we could use to sit and stand with during the day that take almost no effort to lift and lower.I would recommend the s if you are tight on space and don't need the flexibility of the a. I would recommend the a if you have more room and want the flexibility of side to side motion. We don't have the bow hinge on either, so I can't say how they work, but we could see the benefit for sharing one monitor at an angle without having to have someone stand behind you.My wife sits and stands on and off during the day as her back requires as expected.  I thought I would alternate sitting and standing every other hour to try it out. I find I actually stand pretty much all day long at my station instead. I sit when I go to meetings and eat or after I work out.  I got very inexpensive stand mats (less than $15) and I use mine all of the time and it makes a difference on my feet.  My wife uses it less because it gets in the way when she uses her chair. I have a foot stool I use when I stand to keep one foot propped up on and off and I flip the mat over that when I sit, so it works out well for me.The bottom line is both of these workstations are excellent for our needs. With work surfaces and large keyboard trays, they will each run right at $500 apiece.  I find the benefit of being able to stand and sit well worth it. They are very sturdy, but they do take time to set up correctly. Setup is fairly straightforward with the instructions, but not trivial.  The only issue I had was the holes for the worksurface on the s didn't line up perfectly and took some time working that out. Adjusting the tension on either takes some time, more so on the a, but everything works when you get it right. I find that I keep the keyboard higher than I thought to avoid wrist fatigue, but at the right height, it is not an issue. Getting the cabling right so it is clean and tight also takes time, but it turns out well if you work through it.  If you are a hard typer, the monitors will bounce a little, but I adjusted easily and got used to it.  More tension could reduce that, but I don't find it an issue.The cool factor on both is way up there, particularly the a.  You will get attention.  I wrote this review because I found very little online comparing the two models. I hope you find this useful.",1

I'm feeling far more alert both during and after work. While standing, I'm much more mobile. I no longer need to ""get up and go get coffee."" I can just ""go get coffee."" That might not sound like much, but it's a big difference. While sitting, I'm far more comfortable, since the keyboard and screens are positioned at the correct heights for me.I'm standing about 75% of the day. I didn't need any time to ""ramp up"" to this level, but I'm also on the younger side. I do have a soft mat to stand on, since the office floors are concrete underneath thin carpeting.Set-up was easy, but I took my time to do things cleanly. Took about 90 minutes. They include some channeling for your cables, which was a nice touch. You may want to have a few spare zip-ties though. One tip: wait until the end to attach the writing surface, otherwise, the bracket that holds it down will get in the way of one of the tension adjustment screws. A second tip: have a ratcheting screwdriver with a couple of phillips bits, allen bits, and and sockets handy.The product is sturdy and well-built. A lot of the component parts are plastic, but I don't have any concerns about them breaking. It's made in China, which I'm not enthusiastic about, but there weren't any American alternatives that were similar in design. I considered purchasing one of the Kangaroo series workstations from Ergopro, but it didn't have the clamp to secure it to the desk, or the separate platforms for typing and writing.I've had to do some work at clients' offices these past two weeks as well, where I didn't have the Ergotron. It was miserable, haha. I'm probably going to end up buying another one of these for home, or better yet, convince my company to buy them for the office, so I can take this one back home for personal use. Several colleagues have already shown interest in getting them, so it's a possibility. Remember, if you buy it on your own, that's using post-tax dollars. If you can get your company to buy them, they can probably finagle a bulk discount, and they can use pre-tax dollars on it. It takes small bite out of their bottom line, but definitely pays for itself in productivity boosts, and when each unit is only a few hundred bucks, they can definitely find the budget.",2

The unit is solid and great quality with a smooth operation. One thing I worried about prior to receiving was if the worksurface could be written on without the unit lowering or too much shaking, it works great and is solid. You cannot lean on the desk or it will lower but writing/typing/mouse do not affect it. I also recommend the bow hing like other users, sharing the monitor during an office meeting is invaluable.I was also concerned about the monitors shaking during use. They do move slightly about a millimeter or 2, but it is not at all distracting as I thought it would be.I am 6 ft tall, with my dress shoes and a standing mat I am 6' 3 inches, and I use the tall users kit and it fits even better than before (no I am not an Ergotron salesman). I disagree with the ergo recommendations that say the top of the monitor should be two inches above eye level, I think that is true for sitting, but when standing you will want that sweet spot between where your head rolls forward and rolls back when relaxed. To attain this spot, you will want the center of the monitor at eye level or 2 inches above eye level. I am not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt but I have had standing desks for a year now and found this to be the most comfortable. To attain this height, I think even <6 ft tall users might want the tall users kit.The keyboard max height is the only restriction I have come across, at my height, my hands come down slightly from my elbows to the keyboard which is not recommended. I can angle the keyboard tray but it feels awkward. The keyboard has two preset angles and neither of them fit perfectly, it would have been helpful if the keyboard could raise just a little bit more or fully adjustable keyboard tray. The restriction is really based on the height of the desk you attach to, so if you can raise that desk, you could reach any height you want.Another useful piece of info I could not find anywhere else, you can use the tall users kit on the bow hinge. Also make sure you get a standing mat or your feet will hurt. I had a kitchen version the first time and it flattened out within a few months. I recommend getting one for industrial use.",1

I have had a standiing work station for several years now and find it the most comfortable way to work. The problem is when you want to sit, you have to get an elevated chair. I have had less luck with elevated chairs. They are never as comfortable as the regular height ones. So the obvious solution is something that can convert between heights. I did a  lot of research and this brand name received by far the best reviews. The major comment people have made is that the screens bounce when you type. I have to say that I noticed this as well but it is not so significant that I feel to make it a complaint. Instead, I am learning to use a lighter touch to my keyboard. Still it's not a problem for  me.I have Amazon Prime and this one purchase made that worth it. Not that I don't get lots of use from it all year round but this thing is not light. It's not heavy either but I would guess about 40lbs total weight when shipped and that's not inexpensive shippipng.When it arrived, it was in one larget box, very securely fitted inside and it was obvious that there would be no damange unless the box was severly damaged as well. Removing the pieces from the box had me a little overwhelmed at first but when I began assembly, I found it quite easy to both understand and do. I assembled and attached it to my desk in about an hour. It actually almost took longer to attach the keyboard and monitors and wire everything up than to assemble the actual unit.I have been using it for about three weeks now and am so glad I purchased this. For anyone who works from home and finds themselves checking back and forth between documents, a two monitor set up is the way to go. However, laptop users, most of you will find it a more troublsome task than you would think. Still it can be done and has been done on my works station. I have to say that the thing that attracted me to this model was the additional work surface in the middle. I use it extensively and I don't think I would like this product as much without it. So overall, I give this product and A. Wish it could be an A+ but the screen bounce takes that lettle edge away.",1

It's a non-trivial setup, and takes a bit of tweaking to get the resistance just right for your equipment (wait to do this until you load up all your accessories - monitors, docking station, etc), but works like a charm once adjusted.  Strong enough to resist forceful typing pressure from a large man while still being easily adjusted between sitting/standing locations.  Workspace shelf is a clutch feature for storing either electronic peripherals or leaving a blank workspace, depending on what you do.  Dual monitor mounts supports 2x 24"" monitors, not sure you could go much larger while still fitting. Haven't had any issues mounting stability as I've moved it across 5 different desks since I got one.  Have not noticed any durability issues across those years and despite the multiple teardowns/rebuilds.  We ordered a full set for my team, everyone really appreciates the flexibility in office spaces that aren't equipped with adjustable height tables.  In my opinion, one of the better manual adjustment standing desks on the market.One potential consideration / drawback - to use comfortably at sitting height, I have to lower the keyboard to slightly below the height of my desk.  This means that it protrudes ~1 foot outward from the desk, moving back your chair.  Only time I noticed this as a problem was when I was sharing an L-shaped desk/cube with another person - I felt like I was taking up too much space when in the sitting config.  Could also be a problem in small offices if you don't have extra clearance behind your chair currently.",2

It is very sturdy, has a great warranty, and fits my height very well.A couple of things I wish could have been added.1) There is a lift for the monitors. I wish that there was an area that could be adjusted to lift them at the full extent as they lower a little bit as they are slightly heavier than recommended. The main lift for the ""standing"" has this ability, but the monitor lift does not seem to have this ability. I have two 23"" monitors and was hoping that they could support up to 27"" one day or have some sort of replacement for that.2) The cable management is kind of lacking. The things that were added on were okay, but never go for the things that we rely on that ""stick"" to the device.3) I wish the keyboard area was larger. I had to sacrifice the mousepad that I just bought cause it's too big and it's pretty standard.4) If you type really hard like I do, I have a mechanical keyboard at work, then you will find that due to the lack of being able to really add a mousepad that the mouse will move on it's own due to normal work load and a not slippery, but smooth surface, however it does not fall off, which is good.5) If you're over 5' 11""and say your desk height is only between 22"" and 25"", then you may want to be aware that his product may not be ""tall"" enough for you.",1

Besley,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2017","I had seen this in use at another office and thought it would fit my needs perfectly.  I wasn't disappointed.  The unit is well made and was fairly easy to setup.  Most all the tools are supplied.  You will need a 14mm socket (or wrench) to adjust the tension on the main raising/lowering mechanism.  I love having the worksurface to layout papers and such.  The keyboard tray has three setting for depth and a couple for side to side.  The side to side gives you the ability to offset the tray to either side so as to have the keyboard centered (very nice feature if you're OCD on where you keyboard sits in relation to the monitors)  If I would have any concerns to pass along, it would be the distance you are from the monitors (it can seem closer than you may be used to).  Again, you can adjust the fixed keyboard tray out some, but that is limited. Of course you can always stand further from the monitors, but that is limited to your arm length ;-)  The other possible concern would be the loss of use to the desk space behind the unit.  This unit it perched on the front lip of the desk and limits the usefulness of the desk space behind it.  It does not lend itself to be easily reached around.  However, that space can be used for fixed items like pictures and knick-knacks and such that you want to display and care little about accessing.",2

A family friend had purchased this one and 3 other colleagues of mine had already gone the standing route.I received and assembled the desk myself, which was a quick process, and also re-ran my computer-related cables myself.  Everything was easy, although I needed to bring tools from home to tighten the tension on the sliding desk/keyboard component.  It, too, was easy once I had the tool.The desk is sturdy, and therefore heavy, so I had our facilities group confirm that it's placement wouldn't cause the desk to collapse under its weight (as it was placed in the center of an ""L"" shaped desk and there are not support legs in the area).  The furniture contractor said no additional leg was necessary, but added a small supplemental bracket where the two halves of the desk meet to form the ""L.""Once tightened, the sliding mechanism is smooth and easy, and doesn't slip down under the weight of my hands on the keyboard or books, drinks, etc. on the desktop.I'm slowly working up to more and more standing time, but currently sit for a couple hours midday to give my back and heels a rest.  I highly recommend a standing pad to reduce the pressure on your feet and back.  Desk works great both in the standing position and in the seated position.The concept is spreading here and the desk is definitely a conversation starter.  I say go for it!",2

I used to have a much more expensive electric desk, but I had to buy a new option at my new place of employment, and bought this on the recommendation of our ergo team at work.  I typically do not like keyboard trays, but this one is very solid/secure, and the good thing about it is that you can get the keyboard to the perfect height when sitting or standing, and the monitors will adjust separately up/down.  Very nice.The instructions for assembly are extremely clear, and there are YouTube videos you can use too.  I did have to use both adjustments (special, included tool for one, wrench for the other) to tighten up the tension so that the whole unit would stay solidly up or down, and so that the monitor adjustment (a separate one) would also.

I like the extra worksurface but when standing I need a document holder to do my data entry.  This was interesting in the least because most document holders are solid and then block my monitors.  I am using a 3m legal size document holder with clear plastic and positionable legs.  I have the holder slanted way down so it is is below my monitors but slightly elevated from the flat worksurface.  Works great but I bet if Ergotron created a clip on legal size document holder with a moveable data entry guide it would be a perfect solution for monitor clearance.  Plus, my workstation is a semi-circle shaped where the computer should go.  I originally put the clamp off to the side which worked great but I didn't like having people walking quietly up to my back.  When clamped in the semi-circle area the keyboard ledge is a little long and will not go all the way down since it hits my desk.  I do not think I would have it that low due to my height anyways.  I tightened the top tension adjustment and can put alot of pressure on keyboard area and the desk does not move down.  Great!  I do not feel sluggish all day but up and ready to go.",1

Pounds,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2014","Several people at my office are using these, so I wanted to get one for home to try it out.  I had two 22"" monitors on risers before I installed the Ergotron and had to swap one out because it did not have a mounting bracket.  Installation took a couple of hours, but the instructions were clear. I did end up with a lot of extra screws, but better to have an excess than to be short a couple.  I have my laptop on the shelf (with my mobile phone charging) and a wireless keyboard and mouse on the keyboard tray. The surface is fine without a mousepad.In the first few weeks, I could stand only 1-2 hours at a time, but now I can do about 4 hours of work on my feet. I have a plastic carpet protector over a medium pile carpet in the office, so I did not go for a standing pad under my feet, but the folks at the office do have those.With the laptop on the shelf, cable management takes some work, so you may want to budget a few dollars for cables lengths that match the setup you want.Things to consider:Standing pad under your feetGet the right length cablesCan you mount your monitor?",1

Propping my monitors on a stack of books was a drag, and I just wouldn't do it.I've purchased many Ergotron solutions over the years, and I regret waiting this long to research a sitting standing option that was sleek and sturdy. The Work-Fit S is everything I wanted, beautifully engineered, moves from sitting to standing effortlessly, and attractive enough.

Lyon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2016","I do enjoy this workfit system! The construction was excellent in dimensions (for books and such) and the installation was not difficult if you are savvy with instructions. I added the Conversion Kit for my laptop and that also works well. The adjusting of the monitor and laptop are done easily by sliding them left or right and a screw is in place to tighten them into place. The system can be adjusted to fit whatever weight you place on center shelf  very easily (with work or school related reason, not defiance). The station is worth the expense due to the ease of work, by transitioning from sitting to standing and vice versa. It beats having to push a button and your whole desk rises and then you forgot what you were doing. With that said, unless you need the contents of your desk at an arms reach, this is a great invention! If you are a student or a writer, I would only recommend purchasing the workfit with the shelf in the middle.",2

Would personally like to know the engineering that translates the tightening of a hex bolt to an increased counterweight.Like any exercise tool, the benefits of this device is dependent upon the habits of the user.  I have found that I got tired faster than expected from standing, and that it becomes harder to focus for certain tasks while standing, which may vary between users.  For instance, my plantar fasciitis prevents me from standing barefoot, but is mitigated by wearing shoes with a generic orthotic.

The ability to fine tune the height of the keyboard tray and monitors separately is nice.  The unit is stable with two 22"" monitors and I have no bouncing issues.As this unit clamps to the front of your desk, it's important to remember that this pushes you out from the end of the desk.  I'm not at the office now, but I'd say it adds a good 12"" from the edge of the desk.  At first I set mine up in the corner of my desk (it's an L shaped desk) and I was not able to lower the stand to sitting position as the keyboard tray would catch on the corner.  Once I moved it to a longer straight section, I was able to sit in a chair fine.Don't cheap out on purchasing a good anti fatigue mat.

On some other products, the keyboard rests on top of the desk/work surface when lowered to the sitting position.  Assembly was quick and easy (I always read instructions for product assembly).  You will need to consider the design of your desk/work station.  My preferred location was directly in line with a mounted under desk drawer.

I have had it for four years. It is sturdy and does not wiggle or shake.  It clamps onto my existing desk without scratching. Assembly was incredibly easy. I have recommended it to numerous friends. When I was working full-time, I stood at this desk until around 2 PM. Then sat down for the rest of the day. When you move the unit up and down, the movement is smooth and controlled. Once you get it to the height you want it doesn’t shift easily. In other words, the counter-weight system is well-designed. Yes, it is a lot of money. But WELL WORTH every penny. My back and neck are happier. I plan to keep this riser for many more years.",2

I have been using one for many years, recently changed employment so I had to buy one for myself. It is easy to put together and extremely easy to use. I am a paralegal and without this stand, I would be stuck sitting for 8 hours every day with few breaks to walk around. My circulation is better with is a break to go from sitting to standing without disrupting the flow of work. I am also tall, at 5'9 a standard work desk is too short for me, this stand puts both the keyboard and monitors at the appropriate height so that I am not hunching over and can maintain my posture. It does take up a lot of workspace on your desk, but my overall health is worth the lost space.",2

Note: several were recommended for comfort due to medical conditions (i.e. needing to stand periodically).  Shipments arrived very fast and packaging was excellent.  All parts were labeled clearly.

A lot of co-workers opted to raise their desks. Then they needed to buy a taller chair. With this, I am able to sit and work, and then stand as I need to, being able to raise the monitors and keyboard simultaneously. The only drawback: the monitors are mounted to a stationary bar. Before,I could pull one closer to lessen head movement when looking between the two. But, all in all, I'm glad I went this route.  It is fairly heavy, and does require some assembly. I'm glad my IT guy was willing to help get me up and running.",1

The shelf above my desk prevented it from maneuvering properly, as well as the wall behind my desk. This made the unit stick out further than my desk and making it hard to reach my phone or anything else on my desk. The monitors are only adjustable to go up and down, not tipping it forward or backward, and my right monitor kept slipping to a crooked position so I had to put a pencil under it to keep it from doing that.  The tension on my unit had to be tightened every couple of weeks (using a tool that I had to borrow from someone) and we were never able to make it anywhere close to perfect. The assembly required special tools and was much more involved than I would have liked.  I just took my unit down, again dis-assembly was very involved, because I could no longer deal with the shortcomings and the headaches, literally, of dealing with the non adjustable monitors, after the 5 months of trying very hard to like this product. Of course, too late for a return.  Very disappointed.",-2

After spending at minimum of 1.5 hours to set up, I am not crazy about the unit.  The directions are awful, they are all pictures, no real explanations provided.  One piece I put on upside down and it fit, had to go back to fix.There is no way to adjust how far away the monitors are.  I understand they can't be as far away as they are on my standard desk but they are way too close now with no option to adjust.  You also cannot adjust the monitor angle, it is fixed.  I have a privacy filter on one of my monitors and not being able to adjust is making it difficult for me to see my own screen.They are sending someone over to adjust the tension as I don't have another large block of time to set aside to get this correct.  A leaflet was included in the box indicating you could have someone install for you.  I called the Ergotron number, was given a different company and number to call.  They asked for the model and my location.  They charge $279 to set up the unit.  This seems extreme to me considering the cost of the unit itself.  It also tells me the technicians who do this often also spend a decent amount of time to install and get the tension correct.I mounted this to my desk and it looks awful when walking into my office and makes the desk surface completely inaccessible while the unit is being used.We are going to be trying a different model in our office, hopefully that one fairs better.  I would not spend money on this without some modifications being made.",-2

I don't have employees dancing around their desks, but they do have the ability to sit and stand at will now. It also raises the awareness about ergonomic positioning to others as they pass by.  The armature is adjustable for different desk depths which is nice for mounting in cubes with 30"" surfaces.However, the assembly is slightly more than I bargained for.  There are lots of parts - but, they can be assembled by following the instructions.  Mounting to an existing cube farm is difficult and requires 2 people and 20-40 mins of time.  The fine print I missed is that the weight of larger graphics monitors will overpower the spring used for monitor height adjustment (9-14 lbs each).  Had to use a block to keep the monitors at the right height.  Also, the keyboard tray is not adjustable in any way - it only has one height and one angle.  For a company with 'ergo' in the name, you would think they could deal with one of the most important ergonomic issues - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  They failed to cover a step in the instructions to tighten the screws on the back of the monitor slide so the whole upper part doesn't rotate side to side.  Also, the zip ties they include are crappy plastic that break if you breathe on them.It is a cheaper option than a height adjustable desk with keyboard tray but not nearly as adjustable for people with real ergonomic issues.  And, can be mounted with little disturbance when the employee is not there, since you have to dismantle their monitors and thread the cables, etc. to mount it.",-1

Pull the outside edges toward you like you were closing a large book) but having smaller monitors wouldn't be as affected by thisInstall tip:Use a power drill with a nut driver to both install and adjust the arm.  I had a Snap-on ratchet screw driver so my install was technically by hand but it would have been easier and faster with the power drill.  My coworker also got one of these and did the whole install with a normal flathead screwdriver she could fit into the end one of the tools provided in the box and it was a pain.  The adjustments made with the hex wrench are easy to make by hand but the nuts are a pain to do by hand.Misc. ideas:- I command-striped a little cup to the front of the work surface to be a pen cup. (Not in the photo) Works great.- I also have headphones wired through the arm (via an extension) and I put two command strip hooks facing opposite directions on the front edge of the work surface and use them to wind the headphones around to keep them organized.  (Not in the photo) Again, works great.- if I get gutsy I might try bending the monitor arm to more extreme angles to get the monitors to wrap more but I'm not there yet. :-pWould like to give this 4.5 starts but amazon won't let you do that and I do have a couple legitimate gripes so 4 it is.EDIT:I moved desks in my office so I wanted to provide a few updates.(1) DEFINITELY do the install with a power drill.  It's SO much easier!  And the arm feels more secured to the desk, too.(2) Go wireless on your keyboard and mouse.  In my previous setup I had my CPU off to the left and my keyboard cord was juuuuuuuust long enough (I already had a wireless mouse), but changing desks meant that I either had to have the CPU away from the corner about 12"" (as shown in the picture).  The only way to accomplish this was to go wireless on my keyboard - and get a longer display port cable for one of my monitors, but that's a different story.(3) Either make sure your monitor cords will be long enough to put your CPU where you want or be willing to live with wherever you can put the CPU. (Excuse the cord confusion in the photo, I've gotten them more organized since I've taken the photo.)(4) I'm 5'-8"" and I've found after a bit of use that I have to have the arm extended to it's maximum height in order to not get achy shoulders while I stand at my station, so keep this in mind if you're a taller person.Overall, I'd still give this 4.5/5 if I could.",1

I priced replacement adjustable-height desks and I didn't want to spend that much--besides I  like the desk I have. It matches the rest of my furniture and I wasn't in a hurry to replace it. This is the best of both worlds. I can stand some of the time, sit for some tasks, and swing this to the side to have access to my entire desk when needed.  I mix it up now and have been for a few weeks now. I also bought a cushy pad to stand on to keep my feet from complaining. I didn't buy the ergotron one but I might choose to at some point.I chose this model because it clips to the back of the desk. My wonderful husband assembled it for me. He was very impressed with the quality of the product and said it was easy to assemble. (He recommends having an area with a lot of space--good thing he didn't try to do it in my office.)I was able to adjust it to have the keyboard be at a good height while sitting. I also bought the kit to convert the dual-monitor to a laptop and dual monitor setup. (At the time I bought this, the price for that kit from the vendor selling at Amazon was too high, and their wait time was too long--I chose one of the other vendors listed at the Ergotron site.)  I have a 27 inch monitor on one side and the laptop next to it. You adjust it to handle the load you put on it and it's easy to move. I guess I'm a gentle typist--it feels secure enough--not bouncy. I wondered if it would feel funny to work on but it's fine--maybe a little movement compared to a stable desk but not enough to be an issue.I'm very happy with my new arrangement!",2

As suggested by another review, this is not extremely simple to assemble if you are night mechanically inclined.  You will need a 1/4 inch ratcheting socket wrench to easily adjust the tension.  A appropriate sized socket is included with purchaseI installed and adjusted it in less than 90 minutes - including drilling a hole in a desk top.  It easily handle two 24 inches Dell monitor and the extra tray is fantastic for holding items like key, coffee cups and tablets without blocking the view of the monitors.The height adjusts almost effortlessly when moving from the seating to standing position as well as when adjusting down.  Keep in mind that this will extend from your desk by the width of the keyboard tray.My back is already thanking me for this purchase!",2

Solt,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2013","It Is a very heavy, well built unit. It is not to hard to put together but there are a lot of pieces. After making all the adjustments of the springs, the unit is very sturdy, the key is to make the spring pressure tight enough so it takes the same amount of force to raise it as it does to lower it. Once you get the ""balance"" you will be very happy with this unit. There is a little bouncing if you type a lot, but it doesn't take long to get used to it. The zip ties are no good if you tighten them, I left them loose so the wires would slide through but they keep the wires close to the arm(I broke the first few trying to tighten them). I have only been using this for a couple weeks, but so far so good.",1

I did a lot of research into other products and liked the flexibility this one offered.  Most the staff who have Ergotron station in my office have the front desk mounted devices that run up down on a pole.  This unit has a single free floating arm that adjusts with tension and can be mounted on the back of a desk or in a grommet hole.This Dual Ergotron product with drop keyboard gives much freedom and because of it's flexibility, I get to keep my overhead bins attached above my desk, a space saver plus.Adjusting the tension on these is the key to a well installed device, part of the set-up did require 2 people.Mine unit adjusts easily to standing/sitting and stays where i leave it. I can even rest my hands on the keyboard while I'm working without moving the device. There is slight movement when typing, but nothing I'm concerned with.  I'm 5'6 and the height fits me perfectly when standing and would probably accommodate someone a couple inches taller very easily.  I believe there is an add-on piece for taller people.When fully extended you will be standing a couple feet from the front of your desk as the unit fully extends it pushes back in to your space a bit.  Not an issue for me, but good to know for those with small spaces.",1

I also wanted a keyboard tray that would be below the desk level. I had hip replacement surgery a couple of months ago, and sitting 8 to 9 hours at a desk working from home was bothering me. I did a lot of research and decided on the Ergotron WorkFit-A, Dual Workstation with Suspended Keyboard. It's been great. I am a hard typer, so when standing it does wobble a little bit, but it's not enough to bother me. Assembly took some time, but this is because I was not in a hurry.

If you have a standard 30"" tall desk, the keyboard will not be at the proper ergonomic height for most people.

Their website states ""transforms everyday offices into dynamic, active workspaces"".  This is definitely not true unless you adjust your existing set up to conform with their product.Also, once you have two monitors positioned, along with the weight of the mounting arm and the unit itself, it becomes too heavy for me to comfortably lift.

Ergonomics are excellent.  I'm 6'2"" and it works great.2. Solid as a rock.  I'm a big person and I can lean on it heavily and it doesn't move.  Yes you can make it rock a tiny bit, but it doesn't move a millimeter when I hammer away on my keyboard.3. Roomy.  I'm so glad I got the bigger TL.  Plenty of room on the keyboard stand for a standard keyboard and mouse.  The top platform has a 23"" monitor and my 15"" laptop with docking station.  There's still room for my calculator, iPhone, planner, etc.4. Good looking.  Yes, my desk looked better without this on top, but I was surprised by how professional it looks.  The fit and finish are excellent.  Several people have commented on that.5. It came with the nicest looking wire loom for the cables I've ever seen.  The self-adhesive cord holders that mount under the top surface just behind the keyboard stand (for the mouse and keyboard cables are slick.  I didn't need all the wire ties, they gave me or the rubber feet for the monitors, but there they were.6. I'm standing 3/4 of the time now.  I knew it would be helpful for my back &  health, but I underestimated how much more productive I would be standing than sitting.  When I want to sit, it's easy to lower.  Raising it back up again is a cinch.7. The straight up-down motion, as opposed to the ones that project forward when raised is a great feature.  I can't see any negative with it and if you have close quarters, it is invaluable.I could go on, but you get the idea.  I cannot encourage you enough to buy a cushioned surface to stand on.  However, don't blow your brains out with the specialty ones for sit/stand desks.  I bought an $18 one at Costco that was designed for kitchen use.Finally,  I don't write a lot of reviews, just for the products I love or hate.  If I haven't been clear enough, this is an awesome product.  This is much nicer than the Vari-Desks I have seen.  Don't skimp, buy the best.",2

It is very solidly built, steady as a rock, and beautifully engineered.  When typing there is no bouncing or wobbling of the platform, keyboard or monitors.  The adjustment from sitting to standing position is very easy and the mechanism is quite and very smooth and does not take a lot of strength to raise.  It takes just seconds raise or lower it.  The height adjustment is variable - the unit clicks into position to lock at the selected height when the spring-loaded handles on the left and right are released.  This means that you can easily raise it to whatever height you are comfortable with.  I am just over 70 inches tall and prefer it close to the maximum height.  At its lowest position it is not too obtrusive and I find that I do not have to adjust the monitor height at all when transitioning from sitting to standing and back again.The stand weighs about 70 lbs but setup is a breeze because it comes preassembled.  Just unpack it and place it on your desk, remove a few more packing materials, and you are good to go.  I originally ordered the Ergotron WorkFit Dual Monitor Kit (97-904) as well because I was concerned that with my two monitors (24"" diagonal screens) the stand would be unstable when raising and lowering it, but I ended up cancelling my order for the kit because the monitors sit very nicely on the stand and feel quite secure.  An added benefit of this arrangement is that I can move the monitors around to adjust their distance from my eyes and their relative angle, which I could not do if I mounted them to the stand using the kit.One thing I would note is that the dimensions on the Ergotron website imply that the unit is 23.25 inches deep but the keyboard tray projects an additional 4 inches so that total depth is about 27 inches.  This was not a problem for me because my desk is 30 inches deep.  Also I would say the color is charcoal grey not black, but that is fine too.  I am very happy with this stand and can recommend it without reservation.",2

I did some research and this brand is apparently the best. There is literally no set up except to put your stuff on it.I have two large monitors that fit perfectly on this stand.

It fit pretty well with the back hanging off just a little bit but it’s still very sturdy.The set up was virtually nonexistent since it came ready to go. It definitely needs two people to lift onto the desk since it’s 50+ pounds. It’s super easy to lift into a standing position (which I do multiple times a day) and lower into a sitting position. I also love that the keyboard doesn’t come out from the unit when standing because I think that may make it hard to see the monitors.The issues I don’t like is that my desk is a standard height of 30 inches. You add the 5” for the Ergotron and and ~4.5” for the monitors and I’m constantly looking up at my monitors. I am going to have to purchase a chair that can raise height but still have my feet touch the ground to be able to see the monitors easily.Other than that, this is a great product and I’m glad I purchased it!",1

I was worried the construction would be cheap and wobbly.  But it's actually really solid.  It works really well.  I bought the monitor attachment so I could move it up and down when I stand and sit.  I think the ability to do that is important, and by using their attachment it frees up more space for my junk.  The top surface is big enough for my note book, papers, post its, and calculator.  And the keyboard area is a good size as well.  The only complaint, or more like suggestion for improvements, is that when moving it up I have to set it at the right height every time.  It would be great if you could preset it to the preferred height so it went right to  it when raised.And I'm really liking spending more time on my feet and off my butt.",1

Ray,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2017","This is an outstanding product! I saw it in action last year while visiting a ready mix company. I returned to my company and ordered two sit/stand desks from another company to see how it would do. The desks were about $126 cheaper than this Ergotron model...you get what you pay for. They were pretty good but the up and down was VERY hard to do. The two guys I got them for had a hard time brining the desks up and down. I decided to buy four of these Ergotron WorkFit-TL, Sit-Stand Desktop Workstation, Black (33-406-085) to see how they compared to the two I purchased from Halter (Halter ED-258). There is no comparison. The Ergotron is so easy to raise and lower even with dual monitors on it. The workspace is so much better too. You definitely get what you pay for. I liked these four so much that I just purchased two more and now almost all of my guys will have a sit and stand desk. This Ergotron desk may be a bit more than most but you will not be disappointed. The keyboard space is long enough to hold the keyboard and a mouse. A great product so far!",2

Benton,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2017","I love my Ergotron sit/stand desktop converter! I researched a bunch of different brands before selecting this one. The biggest selling point for me was having easy-to-use FRONT levers to raise and lower the unit .  A lot of other models have the levers in the back of the unit and customer reviews stated how difficult it is for them to reach around the whole unit every time they need to raise or lower their unit. I bought the wider Ergotron model and I can tell you there's no way I would want to reach around back every time I want to raise or lower my unit. Having them right up front is the only way to go!!! Plus, the extra wide lever design makes it very easy to grab, unlock, and lock back into place.  An another unique design of the Ergotron that I really like is the way the entire unit raises and lowers straight up and down. It doesn’t expand outward, taking up more room like some of the other units. To me, these two features alone were well worth the extra money for this product.",2

Without knowing anyone using an actual standing desk I decided the cost was too much to risk. I chose this converter and I am very pleased with it. I have 2 - 27"" monitors, speakers, and a microphone on the main desk platform and still have room for a paper notebook and other miscellaneous items on the surface. On the keyboard shelf I have the keyboard, mouse, and a few other small items.  The mechanism raises and lowers easily and is very stable. I was worried that it would move around as I wrote on the surface but that is not the case. I do have some minor movement when I type but I pound the keyboard pretty hard and have the desk at full extension. The movement is not enough to really bother me. The only 'feature' that I would like to see, and this is minor, is that the keyboard shelf have some front to back depth adjustment.",1

Well  made, very sturdy,  works  smoothly,  is easy to raise and lower (& I am over 75).  But be sure your monitor cables are long enough to  reach the desktop's highest level,  in case someone unfamiliar with your desktop gets hold of it -  it can move up pretty quickly if you don't have complete control over it when you depress the levers.  My two 27 inch monitors fit fine on top and tend to slow the upward lift,  but a single smaller monitor might be in danger if a child or unsuspecting visitor tried it out without warning. I researched this item fairly extensively and am glad I chose this model.

After walking around the office and trying other people’s stand up desk, I was disappointed by how weak they felt, or how much they shook in the upright position, or how some models leaned out away from the desk when they were lifted up, or even how short or wide some of them are. Some of the desk even felt heavy lifting, so I took a gamble and bought this model. All I can say is that I Love It. The Ergotron feels sturdy, it lifts up and down with ease, it’s wide enough to hold both my 27” and my 24” monitors with some room to spare. Definitely worth the added expense!",2

Two key design features: (1) the top platform has enough room to put papers directly in front and to the side of the monitor so you can work while standing; and (2) the entire platform moves straight up and down.  The Varidesk--which I tried first and quickly returned--does neither.  The Ergotron is very easy to adjust the height, with no squeaks, rattles, jerky movements, or instability.  As I've learned for all home office equipment that is used on a daily basis, you get what you pay for--this one is definitely worth the higher price point!",2

I talked to support and did research to see if there is a way to retrofit it to the new desk - but no success.While I liked the slim profile of the mount, and how well it handled my 34"" ultra-wide screen, there are a few points where things aren't great:1) Overall poor support from Ergotron in figuring out how/if possible to get this to work on a thicker desk,2) Not being able to handle a thicker desk, especially when LX (cheaper than the MXV) is able to handle over 2"" thick desks3) No cable management4) Plate connecting to monitor is black instead of whiteIf I had to do this again; I'd go with the LX or even one of the generic brands that provide USB hubs within the clamp portion of the mount. The slim profile isn't really worth the extra cost, lack of cable management, and inability to handle thicker desks. There are much better mounts out there for lower price than this, making the overall value of this mount poor (i.e., 2/5 stars)Separately, my experience with Ergotron has also been terrible, sent them emails and been on long chats with overall slow and poor quality of responses. If you are a business buying a bunch of mounts, maybe you'll get better service, but as an individual customer - it's clear they don't care.",-2

I have the HX attached to my main desk with the C clamp, and the LX attached to another desk with the grommet mount. I have another desk in the office that I wanted to mount a 27"" monitor, but its design doesn't accommodate a C clamp (too shallow because of the board under it) and I didn't want to drill a hole.Then I came across this model (MXV). From the photos of the reviews from Japan it looked like it could fit my needs, and it sure did. If the lip of your desk is 3 mm, then this arm would mount beautifully. It's specifically designed for this type of application, because instead of the bulky knobs that require so much space, this one uses the Allen wrench to tighten the two round plates under the base.It's little thinner than LX and not all movements are ""tool free"" like in the more expensive LX and HX models, but it works perfectly fine. It comes preassembled in the box, so you can take it out and attach it to your desk immediately.As for the thickness of the desk (as mentioned in another review), the one I received had an extension which would have accommodated thick desks. In fact the default  position of the clamp  was too wide for my desk, so I had to move it a little higher.Overall, I'm very happy with this arm, especially since nothing on the market would have fit the desk without modifications. It's a bit pricier than others, but it's also unique with the slim form factor.",2

I talked to support and did research to see if there is a way to retrofit it to the new desk - but no success.While I liked the slim profile of the mount, and how well it handled my 34"" ultra-wide screen, there are a few points where things aren't great:1) Overall poor support from Ergotron in figuring out how/if possible to get this to work on a thicker desk,2) Not being able to handle a thicker desk, especially when LX (cheaper than the MXV) is able to handle over 2"" thick desks3) No cable management4) Plate connecting to monitor is black instead of whiteIf I had to do this again; I'd go with the LX or even one of the generic brands that provide USB hubs within the clamp portion of the mount. The slim profile isn't really worth the extra cost, lack of cable management, and inability to handle thicker desks. There are much better mounts out there for lower price than this, making the overall value of this mount poor (i.e., 2/5 stars)Separately, my experience with Ergotron has also been terrible, sent them emails and been on long chats with overall slow and poor quality of responses. If you are a business buying a bunch of mounts, maybe you'll get better service, but as an individual customer - it's clear they don't care.",-2

However, after having it for a while , I’ve realized this item is not only over priced but lacks features.For starters the metal is not sturdy or strong at all. It really has difficulty holding my 16lb monitor and I have to tighten the screws to the max and on top of that it easily got a dent from my screw driver falling off my pocket while assembling.On top of that it doesn’t even have basic features like swivel horizontally and so you can only adjust your monitors angles vertically and if you have different monitors then get ready to have them at a angle you will not like.Basic features like a bar to move the arm without pushing or pulling the monitor is an Extra 80-100 dollars depending on time of sale, competition like VIVO actually provide that arm for FREE.Cable management is literally get your own cable ties and manage it yourself, while competing products actually have a plate to hide cables or go through and here it is non existent.I’m disappointed with ergotron and if for the price I am getting something like this where it lacks basic features and get all those and more at a fraction of the cost then I would go elsewhere.",-2

This is nonsense, and the tool should be provided if the sizing is non-standard.The back plate does not hold to the dual monitor bar well. only a single screw is given to hold the monitor from wobbling and it is insufficient.The good:The stand itself is good quality, powder coated, and visually appealing.The dual monitor bar is about 28 inches long (or accommodating to 14 inches per monitor horizontal-edge to center). so it may potentially allow monitor sizes up to maybe 27 placed on the very edge if you have monitors without bezels. I have thick 3/4inch bezels on my 24inch monitors. If you have curved monitors, you may need a spacer plate for proper alignment.So there it is… a good quality stand with sub-par instructions. have a 10mm ratchet wrench handy if you can find one.this is going back if I cannot easily find a ratchet wrench of 10mm size. wtf Ergotron!",-1

You then can't get them perfectly aligned. One or other of them is always slightly out from the other.- I can never get them to sit perfectly horizontal, there's always a slope.All that said, good for the money, well built, feels solid and freed up lots of room on my desk.",1

I can pull them out, push them back, tilt them forward or sideways, raise them, etc.* I can mount it against a wall, push the monitors back, and only require about two inches of buffer between the desk and the wall. This allows me to use my full desk depth and not require buffer off of the wall.* Sturdy. Tensions are adjustable. No sagging after a week of use.* The rail allows both monitors to be easily aligned, minimizing the hassle of manually aligning individual arms.I mounted two 27"" 2k (16:9) monitors and they fit fine. The Ergotron website compatibility checker said they wouldn't fit, but they do and I have about 1/2"" buffer left on the rail. Between that and that it's rated for up to 20 lbs per monitor, I would imagine that almost any set of 27"" monitors would fit on this. Larger monitors will likely require the next size of of the Ergotron 2 monitor rail mount.The biggest downside is probably the cable management, or lack thereof. The only provided cable management is that the lower half of the arm has a removable plate at the bottom that allows a couple cables to be run through it. I have 2 display cables and 1 power cable per monitor (6 total) and they don't come close to all fitting. I have to do the cable management myself.A more minor downside is that if the monitors are pushed back with the arm angled to the side (ex, there's a wall behind the monitors) the monitor stand won't align with the center of the monitors unless the monitors are very high. The arm is made of two pieces of unequal length (all Erogotron arms are), so angling the arm to the side and having the top piece double back the bottom piece yields a center stand that is 2-3 inches offset from the center of the monitors.As an aside, here's a detailed schematic showing the exact measurements: https://www.ergodirect.com/18667-ergotron-45-489-026-lx-desk-mount-dual-direct-arm-polished-aluminum.html",1

I get it working and it works for a while then you update OS and it stops working again.  IMO they should not be advertising this as MAC compatible.  Works fine on my Windows machine at work.  It appears that they are not putting the proper resources into making sure their utility software and wireless setups are compatible with MACs.  They want the added sales from MAC users but not willing to support it properly.  All I get from tech support is excuses and finger pointing to Apple OS and their security protocols.  I personally do not want to hear excuses.  I just want it work and I  do not want to spend hours and hours constantly making sure it works when I need it.,-2

I thought I'd get something different for home use, and after some research decided on these. Unfortunately, I was not able to completely assemble them myself -- I got most of the way there, but could not get the monitors properly adjusted. I watched all the ""how-to"" videos I could find, multiple times, but I could not replicate them. Someone else had to finish assembling them for me.Furthermore, I'm disappointed in their range of motion. When I use my standing desk in the standing position, these arms won't raise the monitors high enough, so I am forced to read with my neck scrunched down -- which partially defeats the purpose of having a standing desk. Ultimately, I will probably replace these monitor arms since they lack the flexibility they are supposed to provide.",-1

The Allen wrench was too long so I had to go to lowes and get a smaller one so it would stop hitting against my desk when I would tighten. Then once I finally got it tightened up. Went to mount the VESA mounting screws to my monitor and they weren’t long enough. So had to go back to lowes again and get some screws that was long enough. Incredibly difficult to reach the screws for adjusting the monitor. Don’t know if I would buy this again but this is also my first monitor mount.,-1

I appreciate the simplistic zip tie solution for cable management, but do wish for a clamp instead of just letting the ties hang.The arms are sturdy and I am still dialling their tensions as I use them. I move my monitors frequently for different applications and so often find myself needing to take care when raising the height to avoid popping the caps off the second arm base. I would have appreciated a bolt on top of the arm connections to prevent them shimmying up when moving my monitors up.Overall very good.

My only monitor arm experience prior to these are with Humanscale monitor arms.So far I'm really liking these. They have less wobble than the Humanscale arms I have on another setup at home. I don't move my screens very often, but the times I have, they move easily and stay exactly where I stop them at. Not much movement at all either when I'm lowering/raising my standing desk.Install was pretty simple overall. The only minor complaint I have is with a little tab that is inside the of the upper arms that attaches to the lower arms. From what I can tell, the metal tab is for the small set screw to push against so the upper arm has more/less tension against the lower arms (See my second photo with the red arrow). After doing a dry install to make sure all parts fit and where I wanted it be mounted at, I took the upper arms off of the lower arms, and the tabs from both upper arms fell out. Took me a little bit to figure out where they came from since they're not mentioned in instructions specifically. I just popped them back in, but they can fall out easily if you're not paying attention. Just something to keep in mind in case it happens to you.Aside from that, the only thing I wish this had was a pass through for the monitor cables in the base portion of the mount. Would make for a cleaner look if the cables were hidden within the base portion of the mount, although that would require a larger hole to be cut for the base mount.Overall, I'd definitely recommend these mounts for a dual Apple Studio Display setup.",1

The stability, the strength, and how universal the construction of it all is, it’s actually astounding. The maximum size and weight each arm is rated for is 27in and 20lbs, but the curved 32in MSI Optix I have on a single arm is at least 20lbs. I haven’t modified the strength or locks on either of the arms or mounts, and they feel rock solid.Ergotron actually thought of everything. My desk, like many others, has a ‘lip’ or edge that hangs off to increase the structural integrity of the desktop. This started to worry me as I wasn’t sure if the clamp-press mechanism would be wide enough for the edge ‘lip’ hanging from my desk. When it arrived it was exactly that size fully widened, so it wouldn’t fit. However in the box there were parts to convert the base of the arm to attach to a desk via a bolt through a hole(e.g. a wire organizer hole, drill hole). This saved me from having to heavily modify my desk or return the arm, and made the entire building process a breeze even with hurdles in the way.",2

They have a wide range of movement so you can tilt the monitors and access the bottom/back to manage cords and whatnot. Sturdy and well built with great resistance which helps keep the monitors in place. I highly recommend these!!!,2

Very heavy duty and well designed, the arms were easy to setup and position.  The manufacturing for these arms is flawless; really well done using quality materials.  I thought that some of the design features are very well done.  Good resistance to movement, nice cable management channels, tool-less VESA mount screws.  I'm really enjoying these arms and will be selling my other aluminum arms shortly.  I purchased these because of Ergotron's prevalence in hospitals, but am now an Ergotron fan because of my stellar experience with their product.  I've got a second set of monitors that I need to mount and will be purchasing a second set of these bad boys.",2

I had bought the AmazonBasics version first because it was cheaper, but I couldn't figure out how to make the monitor plate not face the ceiling.So I returned that one (twice) and bought this one -- but lo and behold, once again the monitor plate was facing the ceiling. But this time I found a chat, and got a quick answer. The rep told me to hold the bottom between my feet, and then gently rotate the top. I had been trying to rotate in the wrong direction. And it really does help to brace the thing with your feet. So yes I could have kept the less expensive AmazonBasics version of this product. In any case, it's terrific!And one more thing -- the mount doesn't fit on the desk edge due to the modesty panel. But we didn't use the alternative hardware for putting the mount in the outlet hole of the desk. Instead, after removing the outlet hole cover, we inserted the mount THROUGH the hole, and then screwed on the bottom part by crawling underneath the desk.",1

Although those arms did well enough, the tilt was too weak and the heavier of my two screens would often droop if I touched it wrong, defeating the purposes of movable arms as I could only touch the monitor lightly.For reference, my heavier monitor was the 27'' Asus XG27UQ UHD 144Hz AS. The feel of the arms feel like it could handle something heavier with no problems, assuming that the arms are rated for them.Finally decided that I'd try these Ergotron arms (the dual option) and was immediately taken aback at how heavy and dense every single part of the arms were. These things feel like machined metal and although I still feel the price was steep, I can't help but still feel it was somehow worth the money. As these things are not gas assisted, they should hopefully last a lifetime.Installation was incredibly easy, with the clamp option already pre assembled to the base. I made the mistake of thinking I had a defective product due to the arms not being able to move once you attach it to the monitors without attaching to the base, but noticed a small fine print saying that adjustments only work once the arms are actually mounted to the base with the monitor. And lo and behold after putting them on they adjusted just fine.Would definitely recommend, assuming ergotron don't mess with the production.",1

I have got two hp Z27 4k screen, and each is about 9-10 kg? They are heavier than any usual screens and given its size, hard to find a proper arm can bear their weight. I am a bit OCD, so I have to make sure that my screens are properly aligned.Given up on multiple relative cheaper arms, I want to give it ago after read reviews and watched youtube videos to demonstrate this arm. It is expensive, but I think it worths the price. Well built and looks nice for a matte black finish. Easy to build, major parts just need simple assembly, takes about 10-20 mins, most of the time spent on adjusting the angle and tensions.If you have heavy screens, I suggest to buy this one, no need to buy the arm for a single screen if you have two screens and worried about the strength (i thought about this too), it seems to work pretty well so far.",2

It just wasn't made quite that well, and did not have the positioning abilities that I wanted, plus it wasn't tall enough for my standing desk. This arm is much, much better - it's very well made and holds my monitor very securely. It's also very easy to move the monitor to just about any position I want with very little effort. So it works for my stand up/sit down workstation, which is just what I needed. Why four stars? Because I am 5'2"" tall and this are does not have the height I was looking for. Unless there's an adjustment that I don't know about, maybe. From what I've seen, it looks like the top arm is at its highest position just like in the picture on Amazon. I can get the monitor to go down, but no further up. It's impossible to tell from the very scanty instructions which joints are repositionable and which aren't, so maybe I just don't know how to get it to go higher.  And I also may be too picky, but I want my monitor at eye height so I don't have to look down at all, I want to be able to look straight ahead and have my information straight in front of me.  This arm is about 3"" too short of that. So I have the extension arm on order, and am hoping that will give me the extra couple of inches I want for this arm to be perfect for me. However, this is just a personal preference. Other than that, this is a great piece of equipment, it looks like it's built to last forever!!!! Easy to install, too, even with the crappy instructions. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to be able to reposition a computer monitor regularly, especially if you're in a stand up/sit down workstation like I am. This arm is just perfect for that, with the exception of the height problem. And that may not be a problem for anyone else. If anyone out there knows how to adjust that top arm to go higher than the approximately 45 degree angle it's at please let me know!  Overall, very well worth the money and I'm glad I shelled out the extra bucks to move up to this arm from the one I had.Update: I received the extension piece for this monitor arm that is sold here on Amazon. It's basically the same piece as the part that attaches to the pole. It took all of a minute to install and re-position my wiring, and the height problem was solved! Now my monitor is at eye height, which is exactly what I was trying to get accomplished. So now this is a five star review! If you're interested in the extension arm, it's the Ergotron 45-289-026 Mounting Extension. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but it solved my very irritating problem, so it was well worth the money. My workstation is now set up exactly the way I want it, with no eye, neck, or back strain from bending over just a little to get closer to my monitor screen. This is an excellent, heavy duty product and I can see no reason why it should ever need replacement. Here's the link:

It is beautifully designed and made.  It is quite heavy & sturdy.  The design is superb.  The parts are all made of heavy duty steel and bolted together with fine screws.  There are 2 Allen wrenches for adjustments.  I used the through table mount but there is also a C-clamp mount.  It can be used with 1 or 2 arms depending on your needs and size of the space.  I used 1 arm.  The instructions that came with it were detailed and excellent.  I had no trouble assembling and installing it.  There are also on-line instructions and several videos at the website of the manufacturer.  It is fairly expensive for a mounting, but it is a pleasure to have and use.  I expect it will last a lifetime.As the instructions note, it is difficult or impossible to move it well until the VESA plate is screwed onto the monitor.  After that, it is readily moved.  The Allen screws and be adjusted to more or less tightness.",2

The cheaper ones are no more than clugs with badly fitting parts and whose screws need to be loosened, if they haven't been stripped, if you want to move the monitor position. In its price range and above I haven't yet found a decent competitor except for the Humanscale M2 or M8. The LX is a well made, nicely designed, unit well worth the price.At first, it wouldn't hold my monitor up -- the upper arm kept sinking -- and yet my monitor, at 15.4 lbs., was well below the 20 lb. max capacity for this unit. The adjustment for the weight of the monitor is #2 on the scant pictographic instructions. The picture instructions are not the best--not the worst but. . . Anyway I searched for an adjustment to the spring-tension canister in the upper arm that counterbalances the monitor's weight. Pushing the upper arm up and the screen mount down reveals the adjustment screw head at the end of the canister and the larger supplied wrench fits it. 3 half-turns clockwise made no diff. So I added three more half-turns; better but still slowly sinking. I added a 3 more half-turns--much better. 3 more for a total of 12 half-turns and the balance was perfect. You need to ease your way up to the right number of turns to get it just right balance and to avoid overtightening. Once adjusted correctly, the montoro stays in palce but can be moved easily up and down.What's nice about this unit is that, once you have it set up, you can move the monitor around and up and down without readjusting the tension or loosening/retigthening any screws. Although, if your desk is on casters or wheels, you will want to lock them, which is a good safety rule anyway. The elevation movement is smooth and easy--you can move it up or down with one finger. The horizontal swing movement is much stiffer. It helps if you spray the two large post joints with silicone lubricant liberally and then wipe away thoroughly all of the excess. This won't make the swing movement light, but it does ease it up a bit. By post joints I mean the large joints where the upper arm meets the lower and were the lower arm meets the desk mounting post. These joints have no bearings; they have plastic sleeve-type bushings. Compared to the Humanscale: the Humanscale moves horizontally as easily as the LX moves vertically while the Humanscale moves vertically as stiffly as the LX moves horizonstally--either way I'm not sure the difference is worth the extra money for the Humanscale. This stiff horizontal movement is less than ideal but far better than what I've seen on some of the cheaper units offer. For this price I could live with stiffness given all the other postive features.The LX comes with a heavy duty clamp base and a drill-a-hole-in-the-desk grommet type mount--both come in the box. All of the parts are in a two-layer plastic strip, sealed into multiple compartments with each compartment labeled as to contents. Much better than those units that come with all the screws etc. all in one bag and you have to sort them by count and looks against their picture in the instructions.It's not quite as pretty as the Humanscale M2 or M8, which cost about 60% more, but much more nicely finished than the cheaper units I've seen up close. The LX, with less attractive desk mounting pole, has a greater range of vertical position than the Humanscale.If you can afford it, this monitor arm is a very good choice. If you can afford more, then it's a tough choice between this at its price vs the Humanscale arms at the higher prices. For the money, this is a much better deal, thus, my rating of 5 stars.",2

This arm is expensive, but honestly for something you can keep using its worth the premium.  I always thought a monitor arm is a monitor arm but this product changed my perception of that.This arm has very smooth motion, very easy to move it around and dial in the right setting you need for the situation. Once you got it positioned it is extremely sturdy and stays where you set it.  You can continually adjust this thing with ease, no need to mess with tension screws or jank actions.It looks slick in matte black, which is a lot nicer than the plastic or shiny materials used in other mounts.  Not really a big deal but its sometimes the small details.Installation was easier than any other arm i've installed. The parts are laid out properly and the way it goes together in parts is a lot more smooth than other designs.  Its pretty much 3 lego pieces and you're done, the base is just a base so its not top heavy while you're trying to secure it to your desk.  Monitor cant be nut locked in place so you have to remove the entire last segment to replace your screen, but that adds to the stability of the monitor as it doesn't shake at all.Having a screw to disable rotation is great for my OCD tendencies, you can get very slight rotation but getting it fully strait takes zero effort, no need for rulers.",2

Sadly it is the most expensive. Here is what made a difference to me:1: Stable (other products as well, but this one FEELS stable whereas the others do not)2: Assembly (best in class - including heavy monitor installation)3: Ease of use (best in class - easy to maneuver, easy to move, stays put)4: Aesthetics (bought the aluminum version and it looks really good)5: Quality (this is by far the heaviest, beefiest, well made product in its line)The cons list is short:1: Price (it's expensive, but has from what I can see a best in class warranty offsetting a lot of the inherent cost)2: The set screw ring eats into the back of the post. I wish they would have used a channel or something to help remedy the digging in. This will in time show to my room.3: There is no limiter like the HX (however no others I have used has this to my knowledge)My setup:-----  ------------ -----|  | |  | |  ||2K | |  4K  | | 2K||  | |  | |  |-----  ------------ -----Each of the 2k 27"" monitors use this product.The 43"" 4k monitor uses the Ergotron HX.The 2k left back faces the room. The 4k back faces the corner of my desk. The 2k right is up against a wall.My right monitor is mounted 11"" from the wall with 1/4 gap from the wall to the arm. Math is needed to get it right, so be cautious. The HX has a limiter on the arm.On the cons, I can look past the price as it is a buy once cry once item and a 10 year warranty which means this will definitely outlast my other arms I have in other rooms at a fraction of the cost increase in price over the other items I would trust my expensive monitors to. I have had this monitor setup for 6 years and will likely continue to do so for my workstation. It is PLENTY of space for all my VMs, documents, photo editing, side browser window TV, and communication platform. I expect these arms to last at least 10 years, but if they don't and the warranty does NOT cover something, I will buy another set. I do not expect any of my other monitor arms to last past 3 years.Another item to check out based on my findings: the AVTL is the 2nd heaviest duty mount I found. For non-critical mounting, that is a good mount in my opinion. HOWEVER, I do not know the US presence of the company and do not know how long the mount will last with its 3 year warranty.I am not saying this is the best mount out there but it works for me. I have another room with the AVLT Dual 13""-43"" Mount. I paid less than $190 after tax. The same dual monitor setup here cost almost $650. I do expect to come close to the same cost per year on both items (with the Ergotron edging out slightly at $65 per year vs AVTL $63.33 per year if it lasts the full warranty term). HOWEVER, if you compare apples to apples and do not use a dual monitor mount, now the value is with the Ergotron. The same setup with AVTL as I have on my main workstation (3 single arm mounts) would have cost around $450 after tax whereas the full Ergotron setup set me back $955. Now the cost per year is in the favor of Ergotron for sure as one of my monitors is at the brink of breaking 33lbs (so I did not want to use the almost at limit arm from AVTL where I couldn't find their US presence easily).I hope this helps someone else out there make their decision but I do NOT have any buyers remorse (but I just got them installed today so... YMMV)",1

It's very solidly built, fairly well thought out, and once set up it adjusts easily.  When I unpacked, I was surprised at how heavy it was -- it is really solid.  There are a couple of small caveats but they aren't enough to diminish my rating.First, the adjustment for the counter-spring for the vertical movement is next to impossible.  The design calls for inserting an Allen wrench into the area behind the joint where the monitor mounting plate is attached to engage the rod which controls the spring tension.  First, it is pointless to try the adjustment without the monitor in place since it is the monitor's weight one is attempting to counterbalance, and that means that the monitor will make it impossible to see into the recessed area where the wrench needs to go.  There is nothing in there to guide the wrench so it is practically impossible to fit it into the hex-head on the end of the rod.  Meanwhile, with the monitor and other parts of the arm in the way one cannot just continually turn the wrench -- one must turn it, then remove it and reorient it before inserting it again -- so even getting lucky at getting the wrench seated the first time won't help much.  Lucky for me that the factory setting was almost perfect for my monitor so I didn't have to monkey with this that much.  It is a bad design and I hope they are smart enough to change it for future offerings.My second caveat is really minor, but it just seems like they could have easily handled it better.  One installation option involves installing the arm on a surface by running a bolt in the platform of the arm through a hole in the table's surface and then using a wingnut to clamp a small plate underneath the mounting surface.  This works well but the bolt is very long -- I'm not sure why they need a bolt that long.  In my case, there was a drawer beneath the surface where I was mounting it and the excess length of the bolt interfered with the drawer.  One option to fix this is to use a shorter bolt -- that might not be easy to do, however.Where the bolt fits through the platform of the arm, it drops into a square hole and the bolt has a square section at the top of its shaft which locks into that square hole to keep the bolt from turning.  It might not be that easy to find a replacement bolt with that square section as I suspect that it is not a standard part.  Another option is to take a hack saw and cut off the excess portion of the bolt.  Unless there is sufficient room in the mounting area to accommodate a hack saw, this would entail mounting the arm, marking the place to cut the bolt and then removing the arm to retrieve the bolt (and one would likely need a vise to hold the bolt while cutting).  It would have been easy to avoid all of this, however.  The bolt itself is at the bottom of the hollow upright tube which the arm is mounted on -- if they had just welded a nut to the platform and threaded the bolt through a lock-nut, then the welded nut, it could be adjusted to whatever height was desired before installing.  To avoid having to install, mark the bolt, and then remove for adjustment, one could likely just estimate the length needed based on the surface on which it is to be mounted (to be fair, one could do the same with the hacksaw method but with the downside of needing to obtain a new bolt if the estimated length turned out to be too short).One last complaint involves the provisions for cable control -- the cavity in the arm for passing the cables is a little awkward to use and seems a bit small.  It works well enough, however -- the real problem is that there is nothing similar for the upper arm and since a little slack is needed in the cables to allow for moving the monitor around, angling the screen, etc., one is faced with having cables drooping down behind the monitor.  I alleviated this a bit by using some velcro ties to hold the cables to the upper arm so that the slack portion is only from the end of the arm to the monitor.These are minor quibbles, however, and only affect the setup.  Once the arm is in place and adjusted, it works great, easily holds my 22 inch monitor, and I am very happy with it.",1

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",2

It took me over an hour to get the cheaper ones setup, also I could never quite get them at the right height + depth + tilt all at the same time.With these it takes a few minutes tops to setup and you can place them in pretty much any position as long as you leave 1-3 inches of space behind your desk. Definitely recommend them if you can afford them but the budget ones will get you by. Generally I think this is a product you buy once.One recommendation I would make is for dual monitors getting two separate poles for more customizability. It's a bit more expensive but I've found sharing a pole can limit the range of motion if you have two large monitors.",1

The ""tightness"" of it's adjustable parts clearly old, and the base it scratched up.  Also the box looked warn and everything about it feels like I got porked into paying for a new item but received a clearly used and worn one.  The problem is I need this now and don't have 2 weeks to wait for another one.  First time I've ever had to submit a negative review of something I purchased on Amazon.  And it's too bad Ergotron has to get a low review from a customer because of Ingram's poor service. I would imaging that this LX Arm would be nice if it didn't seem like it was used for the last year.  It doesn't seem tight and the adjustments don't hold the secondary pivot arm in place that well.  The construction quality is pretty good, but again it seems like it was used by someone at Ingram for a while before they packaged it back up and shipped it out to me.  Maybe someone will sent me a NEW one and I can return this.  I need it now.",-2

The bolts initially didn't move at all and I noticed green goopy machine screw grease messily spread around the parts where the bolts screw in.

It took less than 6 mos for this to happen. Ergotron is a large company. They are well staffed. Customer service immediately let me know Ergotron doesn't sell any of these parts. They don't deal with end users. They deal with hospitals, company management, and the like. They like to sell in bulk and they make bank.

BUT... I was disappointed that they sent open box, previously installed product. If I'm paying a premium price for an arm this shouldn't be. It installed ok and it will hopefully have no issues. I need it now or I would send it back without hesitation. To begin with, none of the main arm parts were sleeved. I assume it comes that way because an empty sleeves had been tossed back in the box, but no one bothered to re-sleeve anything. The hardware pouch had been opened in 3 places (Poked finger holes. So tacky!). Both Allen wrenches were missing. I have a butt-load of tools so I was able to find the right wrenches but many people might not.  One of the arm finishing caps was loose and rolling around in the box (had been taken out of the pouch). Adjusting screws for one of the joints and the front tension had been tightened all the way in. The screw head on the tensioning screw showed metal filings and heavy scratches indicating it had been worked quite a lot with a wrench. The instructions were crumpled and obviously used. Not a big deal but again, it all felt like getting used product and I'm left wondering what other paper work might have been missing. I'm holding my breath there are no other issues with it. Its seems to be working fine for now but still wondering why it was sent back which I assume is the case. Check out what you get carefully. I recommend sending it back if its been opened and you can spare the wasted time. This should have been inspected and sold as refurbished product with a new hardware pouch tossed in at the very least. My review may be an anomaly. If so, go for it.",-1

I was extremely disappointed by its build quality and design - the mounting clamp relies on cheap mini-screws that offer a poor range of mounting options and scratch your desk. The base mount and the arm support connections don't feel sturdy, and the 'safe-screws' that 'connect and lock the arms' are poorly designed, scratching the own arm junction to offer more 'resistance' to the joint.Don't get me wrong, this product is not TERRIBLE itself - but it is definitely not worth this price to the point it looks like a scam brand.Check the picture that I uploaded here: that upper ring goes up and down freely on the main base stick, and the ONLY thing that holds it in place is that tiny screw that bruises the paint. It also stays in place due to an offset motion stress that the monitor weight generates when mounted.The arm joints don't feel secure at all for frequent motion.I bought both models for my desk setup and I deeply regret the amount of money I spent on them.",-2

It works well when installed, and I am happy. However, QC is an issue and not everyone will have the ability to troubleshoot these issues if they're less than fortunate with their order.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I may have gotten a faulty product, but it's impossible to loosen some of the adjustment screws. I mean literally. The screws are different sizes and the tool they provide you (and refer to in the manual for all of them) does not fit every size. I had to strip their tool to fit the smaller ones, which made it unusable for larger ones. Using my own tools to try to un-jam them (thankfully I own a set of Allen wrenches), they're stuck on radically tight, again, following the directions in the manual. It's lovely to put together and very simple. I can tell the range of motion is excellent when not-faulty, but I was expecting this arm to be the end of my cursed journey buying gas spring arms, and this was one of 5 disappointments in a row. I might need to suck it up and invest in the Wacom Flex, sadly.",-1

A very slight movement of the table, such as might result from moving a mouse, causes an objectionable amount of vibration of the monitor.  Apparently, the arm acts as a lever and magnifies the tiny initial vibration, making it quite noticeable.  Another problem is that my table is only 24"" from front to rear, and the back of the monitor needs to be aligned with the back edge of the table for optimum viewing.  The best I can do is to get the back of the monitor 3 1/2"" from the back edge of the table, at which point the middle of the monitor is 3"" to the right of the center of the table.  It may be possible to adjust the monitor to get it closer to the back of the table and centered, but there are no instructions included with the arm on how to do this, and my attempts to adjust it  have been frustrating.  Finally, there are two hooks on the bottom of the top arm so you can tie the power and video signal cables up out of the way; unfortunately, the hooks are shallow, and moving the arm often dislodges the ties attached to the cables. I paid a lot of money for this arm, but it does not do what I need it to do.",-2

Undoubtedly, it is a sold monitor arm, made well and built to last. The issue that I had, however, is that the adjustments were far too hard to make. After loosening the adjustments for the swivel (monitor angle) and the extension (up and down), it was still far too difficult to do without making direct adjustment to the arm itself. Pushing on the monitor did almost nothing. In fact, while I was pushing on the monitor, the monitor arm popped of the base and hit my desk, putting an annoying dent in my brand new desk! After some adjustment, I was able to prevent the arm from leaving the base, but it was still far to difficult.I have rarely had such an immediately negative reaction to a product. I have already processed a return. I only wish I could return the dent it made in my desk!",-2

The manufacturer of the arm refers you to Apple.  You discover this after you receive the arm.  When you receive the adaptor from Apple you discover it doesn't fit your iMac.

Sie waren nicht gefettet und aus der Anleitung ging nicht hervor, dass das erforderlich ist.Das mittlere Arm-Lager ist ungesichert, d.h. wenn man den Monitor ungünstig anhebt, dann könnten sich die beiden Arme dort trennen - die Folgen möchte ich mir nicht bei einem Apple Studio Display ausmalen.Die polierte Aluminiumoberfläche ist extrem empfindlich gegen Finger- und Handabdrücke und sieht ganz schnell unansehnlich aus.Obwohl ein Großteil der Arme aus poliertem Aluminium ist, ist die VESA-Mount-Platte schwarz.

It looks smart and stylish with its silver and black colours.2.  It feels solid and robust.  Well engineered, not flimsy or wobbly.  The desk clamp in particular is solid as a rock.3.  Price was reasonable (reduced to about £106 from £160) cheaper than similar - e.g. Flo.4.  Frees up desk space underneath. (Ie it is a monitor arm!)Weak points1.  Has no way (as far as I can tell) to stop the ""elbow"" swivelling right back and banging the wall behind the desk.  Some rival products do have this feature.  I have worked around this by altering the position of the clamp sideways relative to where I position the monitor usually.  It's not easy to explain, but now when I push the monitor away the front arm swivels more than the back one so I don't bash the wall.2.  It is not easy to put the monitor exactly where I want it.  For example, It doesn't want to move straight up and down - the movement is more curved because of the way the arm articulates.  So it kind of moves sideways as well as up/down.  I can overcome this, but i have to wrestle with it a bit.  Likewise moving fwd or back, the screen does not automatically stay straight.3.  The biggest problem by far is that it is NOT HIGH ENOUGH.  It was ok (just) at max height, until I raised my seat slightly to improve my sitting posture - but I can't raise the monitor any higher.  The claimed height range of 18 inches is totally misleading.  The arm's lowest position (without a monitor attached) is touching the desk.  The highest position is 18"" above the desk.  But with a monitor attached it won't go so low of course.  So the actual range is only 12"".  And who would want their monitor touching the desktop anyway???  With my 19"" monitor attached the top of my screen is 22"" from the desktop.  It needs to be about 24"".Ergotron make a tall pole version of this product - I would recommend anyone reading this review to buy that version instead so you get 5 inches more height. (I am a very average height male by the way.  Not super tall.).I contacted Ergotron (in Holland) to try to get a tall pole.  They do NOT sell it separately.  The person I spoke to was very helpful and would have sent one free if they had one available - but they didn't.  It was looking like I would have to send the whole thing back.  But I found a small local engineering company that made me a new pole for £30.  (This includes cutting a thread into it so it screw into the base - it's not just a pole, it's a bit more complicated than that!).  This was still cheaper than buying the tall pole version because the short pole version is currently reduced by £60.  But all in all a frustrating experience, because why why why do they sell this poorly designed version at all???One last point - I think all the similar arms such as Flo have equally flawed design.  In fact they are worse - at least Ergotron offer the tall pole version.",-1

Huge dissapointment here.I followed carefully the instructions and out of the 5 adjustments the 2 closer to the monitor mount are barely moving. The rest of movements -these regarding the two arms-  i.e. 360 degrees rotating and up-down arm lift are ok.The forward (down) tilt just behind the monitor is practically impossible, although the bolt is unscrewed to the very end!!! The opposite, (backwards tilt) is a little easier but neverthelss hard...! I recall this problem was emphasized by another amazon reviewer here. The same happens with the 180 degrees ""horizontal level turning"" which occurs just behind the mount. This one has not even an option of fastening or loosening something which implies that should have come factory adjusted...In conclusion if I dare to make these 2 adjustmets -even for just a little bit- the force that I need to use on the monitor is so much that I am afraid of damaging it.The result is that after purchasing a L(u)X arm... practically I am only left to adjust the monitor position only by the ""2 arms adjustments"" plus using wisely the long pole and position on desk to mitigate the loss.It looks like that Ergotron is designed to work properly only with 10-11 kg monitors. Normally when the adjustment mechanisms compensate this type of weight the result should be easier and smoother movements. But this narrowing of optimal use consists a serious DESIGN FLAW for lighter monitors (that are certainly included in Ergotron list!!!) and the consumers that are attracted by the design and the quality of the materials, must be properly informed.This design flow means dissatisfaction for me regarding the Ergotron LX. Especially for the price.",-1

The clamp is pretty thick so if you have anything under your table it may get in the way of the clamp. For example I had a cable hider attached to my table but I can’t use anymore because the clamp prevents it from being attached.For the price you would want something like wires to be handled well.",0

If you aren't, ignore the following.If you want to save 40 dollars, and improve upon what you bought, go to the hardware store, buy a 1"" schedule 80 pre threaded aluminum tube, and please buy aluminum the base is also cast aluminum and if you cheap out and buy cast iron, you will have serious problems with the base and tube welding itself together and destroying whatever paint or coating you use to finish your new tube.  And yes, you need schedule 80 tubing if you're making it longer.  Take apart your stand, its 3 screws holding on a plate that hides the threaded portion of the stand, and remove 3 more insert screws around the circumference of the base.  From there you should be able to easily unscrew the tube, though if you have trouble, use a bit of heat and can easily remove your old tube.From here on, cut your new tube arm to your desired length, file the sharp edges, paint it black, take your old tube cap off, pop it on the new one, and reassemble.  At most you're spending 5 dollars on aluminum tubing, and 5 more on a pipe cutter if you don't have one or a saw.  The tube itself should take well to any kind of paint, or you can just leave it unpainted because aluminum doesn't rust for that hip industrial look.The rest of the arm itself is really well built, if annoying to adjust as it has a very limited range of motion, and the process of finely tuning exactly where the dials need to sit so you can actually move the arms, is unfathomably narrow.  Too much and you're fighting the arm to move it up, too little and your monitor is dragging the arm down.  After messing around with it for far too long, I took it apart, degreased and regreased all the parts, and it adjusted a lot better.That being said, while the build quality is pretty outstanding, its got too many problems to recommend in the slightest.You get what you pay for, but that's it unfortunately.  With a bit of work, you could make it absolutely exceptional.  But to pay an extra 40 dollars for a longer tube is absurd, and an extra 10 on that for white paint, is worse.  Just spend the 200 dollars and get something better, with a wider, more easily done degree of adjustment.",-1

It did make me question the quality of this mount...Otherwise, the mount is OK. I have a 24 inch screen mounted and works according to the specs. It has two joints on the main frame that rotates freely, and it has one tilt joint at the screen base (also has rotation). It is nice for watching movies. It is quite 'heavy duty'. Most of the parts are metal (except the plastic insert). You could seriously hurt someone if you decided to wack him on the head with this mount.",0

This arm did not go up as high as I need it to, and I'm average height (5'7""). When it says the arm goes up 13 inches, that means most typical monitors (mine is 20"") will be only about 10 inches off your desk at the base. Not high enough if you are sitting/standing with correct posture.My husband cleverly fixed this by cutting a block of wood to fit underneath the base of the unit to give me the height I need (essentially, the clamp encompasses my desk and an inch-thick block of wood). Other than the limited height range, I am very happy with the product.",1

This arm was provided by my employer, I have it holding a Dell U3415w monitor that has a VESA mount rating of 18.60lbs, which is below the 20 lb rating that Ergotron states for the LX Desk arm.Installation was a breeze and it really is a quality stand, it is far more adjustable than my existing stand  I had for my previous dual-display (24"" monitors) setup..but it is apparent that adjustability has tradeoffs.When installing heavier monitors you do need to follow the instructions and adjust the tension of the arm resistance of the monitor will slowly (or perhaps rather quickly) ""settle"" to a lower height (if the tension was too great a light monitor may do the opposite and rise).I am somewhat disappointed as the monitor has a ""wobble"" to it when mounted on the LX Desk Mount LCD Arm.  This cannot be taken away by adjusting tension, as it is give within the physical components (that felt so solid when I took it out of the box).  I have an adjustable height desk, and when in the ""standup"" height the desk has a bit of a shake to it when I am typing...with the Ergotron LX that results in the monitor swaying side-to-side, and in a clock/anti-clock-wise orientation (even with the rotation locking screw in place).This would likely be a great stand for a desk that was wall mounted or otherwise very sturdy, but an adjustable height desk will always have a bit of give in it.  My previous stand does not exhibit this problem, for this monitor or the previous ones...and that stand was 1/3 the price tag of this arm.  I feel I will accept losing adjustability and go for stability and buy a different arm for my use.",-1

Immediately obvious that it is a high quality product.The arm will support monitors up to 25lbs and 34”.The tall pole is about twice the length of the normal desk mount and it increases the height you can set the monitor at by about seven inches. The arm, shown in the photos, that sits on the pole is actually optional. You can choose whether to fit that or not. This is where the long pole comes in to play really because that first arm adds four inches or so to the monitor height so if you choose not to fit that arm then you will most likely need the longer pole to achieve a good height for the monitor.The normal arm puts the monitor centre at about 15 inches above the desk max so the long mount so this increases that to about 22 inches max. However I found the arm was most happy at a little less than maximum.The pole comes with two mounting options. Through a hole or a table top clamp. The “through a hole” mount requires an 8 to 51mm hole, and can manage a desk up to 57mm thick. The clamp can manage up to 60mm thick desks. The through the hole method there is a steel plate that fit underneath the desk that can be screwed to the desk  I used the clamp and found that in fact it would go a little further than 60mm, I measured 65mm.The one annoyance with the arm is that there is a small steel shim underneath the screw adjustment for the arms. The shims measure about half an inch square. During my experimenting these kept falling out when I disassembled the stand. Just keep an eye out for them. There is a notch cut in to the aluminium behind the hex screws and they slot in with the curve facing away from the screw. You have to remove the inner plastic sleeve to see the slot clearly although you can see it if you turn the arm upside down.I did discover that you need the tension higher than you probably think you do! If you gently rock the table back and forth, if the tension is not high enough then the monitor will lose height. Adjust the tension until this doesn’t happen.I also found that it was much safer to attach the second arm to the monitor before you fit it to the rest of the arm. It’s just easier to do this than to try to fit the monitor afterwards.Oh and be careful when you are DIY’ing it, aluminium marks easily.Something I really liked were the screws that it uses to attach to the monitor. These are tool-less, which makes it a lot easier...no screwdriver to drop. Ordinary screws are provided if you prefer the higher security.In the end I actually returned the product. The reason was that the monitor just wobbled too much as I typed. Looking at the stand I realised this was the “ball joint” directly behind the monitor. It just isn’t rigid enough and I suspect that is because it’s too small. The entire monitor wobbled clockwise anti-clockwise. So no, after all that messing around, it didn’t suite me. Personally I think one of these wall mounted would suit me much better. That way there is no reason why it should wobble. If the wobble bothers you then don't bother, but if you are fine with it then you could do a lot worse than this great looking stand.",0

Ich habe mich letzten Endes doch für 3 Sterne entschieden. In der Rezension vergleiche ich diesen Monitorarm mit dem ca. 60€ teureren Monitorarm ""Flo"" von CBS (auch auf Amazon erhältlich -> leider nur in weiß)Um es gleich vorwegzunehmen: Der Monitorarm macht im Prinzip einen guten Job bzw. das wozu er gedacht ist. Er hält bzw. hielt hier bei mir einen 27 Zoll Monitor, der ca. 4,5 Kg schwer ist, ohne Probleme und sehr stabil.Kommen wir einmal zu den positiven Punkten:- Der Monitorarm kommt gut verpackt, mit allem Zubehör- Neben der klassischen Befestigung per Tischklemme, ist im Lieferumfang auch eine Befestigung über ein ""grommet hole"" also einem Loch im Schreibtisch vorhanden- Die Tischklemme kann direkt per Drehknauf am Tisch befestigt werden bzw. sodass kein Sechskantschlüssel bzw. Werkzeug gebraucht wird. Dies ist sehr praktisch, da man nicht unbedingt unter dem Tisch herum kriechen muss um die Klemme zu befestigen -> Das ist klasse :)- Neben normalen Schrauben für den ""VesaMount"" liegen ebenfalls Schrauben bzw. ""ThumbScrews"" bei, welche ohne Werkzeug befestigt werden können bzw. um den eigentlichen Monitor am Arm zu befestigen -> Das ist ebenfalls sehr klasse und praktisch :)- Der Monitorarm selbst gliedert sich in 3 Teile bzw. einmal den Fuß mit Stange (welcher am Schreibtisch fest gemacht wird), einem ersten Arm welcher auf die Stange geschoben wird und einem zweiten Arm welcher auf den erste gesteckt wird. Das ganze wird über Kunststoffgewinde gehalten bzw. machte einen stabilen und guten ersten Eindruck. Weiter ist der komplette Monitorarm, neben der Abdeckung für das Kabelmanagement, aus schwarzen matten Aluminium was sehr schön aussieht.- Der Standfuß des Monitorarms ist recht groß geraten bzw. größer als bei den meisten anderen Monitorarmen. Komplett aus Aluminium macht er ein sehr stabilen Eindruck bzw. gerade für große Monitore. Ob es wirklich ein Vorteil gegenüber einem kleinerem Standfuß ist sei dahingestellt bzw. ist rein subjektiv von mir ;)Jetzt einmal die negative Seite:Ist der Monitor einmal befestigt und der Arm justiert, wird der Monitor hier zumindest ohne Probleme gehalten. Jedoch ist das Justieren recht fummelig, da teils nur eine recht grobe Einstellung möglich ist. Dies betrifft vor allem das ""Tilt"" bzw. die Neigung (X-Achse) des Monitorarms. Wie schon andere beschrieben haben ist hier, selbst auf leichtester Stufe, das Neigen so schwergängig das man 2 Hände und gut Kraft braucht. Ich könnte mir vorstellen das dies bei einem schwereren Monitor einfacher geht.Das Hochfahren und Absenken des Monitorarms ist einigermaßen leicht. Durch die einfache Steckverbindung der zwei Arme wirkt dies aber teils etwas wackelig, da sich die Kraft nicht auf die Feder für das Hochfahren auswirkt sondern auf die Steckverbindung, wodurch diese ab und an leicht mit angehoben wird.Die Drehbewegungen (Y-Achse) der Monitorarme sind ausreichend leichtgängig. Die Drehbewegung (Y-Achse) direkt am Monitor dafür leider überhaupt nicht bzw. viel zu schwer (leider kann man diese auch nicht justieren).Fazit und Vergleich zum CBS ""Flo"" Monitorarm:Die schwergängige Bewegung des Arms, ist für mich der Hauptpunkt für die 3 Sterne Bewertung. Für rund 140€ sollte man hier doch mehr erwarten können bzw. zumindest ein leichtgängiges Verstellen des Arms mit einer Hand. Dies ist hier leider nicht gegeben. Diesen Arm gibt es jedoch noch in der  AmazonBasics Variante gut 40€ billiger -> (Einschränkungen hierbei: Es können wohl keine Erweiterungen von Ergotron benutzt werden und der Garantiezeitraum ist kürzer). Wäre der Arm für 70€ bis 100€ erhältlich hätte ich gesagt OK das passt bzw. da dies neben der Einschränkung hinsichtlich der Bewegbarkeit ein guter Monitorarm ist.Möchte man jedoch die Monitorposition des öfteren neu ausrichten, kann ich nur zum 60€ teureren CBS Monitorarm raten. Bei diesem Arm wird auf eine Steckverbindung verzichtet bzw. kann die Federeinstellung des Arms, über eine Anzeige abgelesen werden, wodurch das Justieren deutlich einfacher ist. Weiter ist der Monitorarm wesentlich leichtgängiger und trotzdem sehr stabil. Der im Verhältnis geringe Aufpreis lohnt sich hier meiner Meinung deutlich mehr. Daher werde ich leider diesen Monitorarm von Ergotron zurückschicken.",-1

I have a 32 inch monitor on it and it holds it no problem. I installed it as I watched the Ergotron youtube video on their youtube channel for how to install it and it was almost too easy, haha. Very, very simple to do.The one thing I don't like is how stiff this thing is.  I know how to adjust it and it's so stiff that I actually removed the tension screws on 2 of the joints which means there is no added resistance and the arms are are able to move without any friction or added stiffness caused by the adjustment screws.  And it is still very difficult to adjust.  To make sure I get it where I want it, how I want it I have to stand up and move it.  I'm also 6'1, 185 lbs, so it's not a strength question. This thing is just too stiff.I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it.  It does work, it holds the monitor and it looks good.  But if I had to do this all over again I'd try the amazon basics one because I bet it hold the monitor just as good and maybe it's not so stiff. I'd recommend going with the amazon one, to be honest.  If you are super worried about strength and stability and you don't need to move your monitor much, get this.  If you move it around a lot, try the amazon basics one.  That's as fair and honest a review as you'll find.",0

Sadly it is the most expensive. Here is what made a difference to me:1: Stable (other products as well, but this one FEELS stable whereas the others do not)2: Assembly (best in class - including heavy monitor installation)3: Ease of use (best in class - easy to maneuver, easy to move, stays put)4: Aesthetics (bought the aluminum version and it looks really good)5: Quality (this is by far the heaviest, beefiest, well made product in its line)The cons list is short:1: Price (it's expensive, but has from what I can see a best in class warranty offsetting a lot of the inherent cost)2: The set screw ring eats into the back of the post. I wish they would have used a channel or something to help remedy the digging in. This will in time show to my room.3: There is no limiter like the HX (however no others I have used has this to my knowledge)My setup:-----  ------------ -----|  | |  | |  ||2K | |  4K  | | 2K||  | |  | |  |-----  ------------ -----Each of the 2k 27"" monitors use this product.The 43"" 4k monitor uses the Ergotron HX.The 2k left back faces the room. The 4k back faces the corner of my desk. The 2k right is up against a wall.My right monitor is mounted 11"" from the wall with 1/4 gap from the wall to the arm. Math is needed to get it right, so be cautious. The HX has a limiter on the arm.On the cons, I can look past the price as it is a buy once cry once item and a 10 year warranty which means this will definitely outlast my other arms I have in other rooms at a fraction of the cost increase in price over the other items I would trust my expensive monitors to. I have had this monitor setup for 6 years and will likely continue to do so for my workstation. It is PLENTY of space for all my VMs, documents, photo editing, side browser window TV, and communication platform. I expect these arms to last at least 10 years, but if they don't and the warranty does NOT cover something, I will buy another set. I do not expect any of my other monitor arms to last past 3 years.Another item to check out based on my findings: the AVTL is the 2nd heaviest duty mount I found. For non-critical mounting, that is a good mount in my opinion. HOWEVER, I do not know the US presence of the company and do not know how long the mount will last with its 3 year warranty.I am not saying this is the best mount out there but it works for me. I have another room with the AVLT Dual 13""-43"" Mount. I paid less than $190 after tax. The same dual monitor setup here cost almost $650. I do expect to come close to the same cost per year on both items (with the Ergotron edging out slightly at $65 per year vs AVTL $63.33 per year if it lasts the full warranty term). HOWEVER, if you compare apples to apples and do not use a dual monitor mount, now the value is with the Ergotron. The same setup with AVTL as I have on my main workstation (3 single arm mounts) would have cost around $450 after tax whereas the full Ergotron setup set me back $955. Now the cost per year is in the favor of Ergotron for sure as one of my monitors is at the brink of breaking 33lbs (so I did not want to use the almost at limit arm from AVTL where I couldn't find their US presence easily).I hope this helps someone else out there make their decision but I do NOT have any buyers remorse (but I just got them installed today so... YMMV)",2

Moncure,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2012","Whoah. When I first started shopping I could not believe the prices of the LCD swivel mount arms in general. I was prepared to pull out my grandfather's Erector Set and start fabricating my own hack-job of a monitor stand, or go to Home Depot, buy some metal banding, hinges, cinderblock, screws, and some OSB to fabricate my own industrial-style workspace for about 25% of the price of a fancy swivel alone! But after thinking reasonably and logically, I realized that I may as well invest something that suits the aesthetic of others as well as myself. because I don't always work alone. And I don't have an office in my garage. Plus people spend time actually designing and creating items exactly like the Ergotron swivel with form, fit, function (and, it's in the name) ergonomics in miond for a living. I'll lean on others when they are skilled at something I'm not. So here goes my review.Overall, the fit and finish of the components on the Ergotron LX desk mount could not be better for my workspace's design intent. With a brushed and apparently (I say apparently with caution) stainless steel on black look, the product both walks the walk and talks the talk with respect to its rigidity, appearance and construction. That said it is a very heavy item - so take heed - if you got a wobbly desk this thing will make it more wobbly. But that has more to do with  desk selection than the product. The point is this is a product that from what I can see is MOLDED metal and not an extruded piece of [insert expletive here] that was assembled by someone with little to no knowledge of the metal arts.The product itself has various places to loosen the resistive points on the arms, so you can obtain plenty of degrees of freedom (just look at it) when it comes to repositioning. Just be wary of the ceiling if, say, you're placing this in a nook that has a ceiling that slopes down and intercepts the reach of the product - which is what's going on with my current setup.Overall, after about a month of use I am pleased. I can bring the monitor closer to my kids and away from my workspace when they want to watch movies, and I can place it in the most comfortable position require depending on how I orient myself at work.I installed this on a more traditional desk with a rather measly lip on the back. With the included hardware, however, I was able to screw through the desk and pull up with the clamp. In such manner I have sort of haphazardly rigged it to my workspace. However, this was my choice - the better choice would have been to either (1) utilize a desk with an opening for an integrated monitor stand, or (2) utilize a workbench style desk (the latter being the best likely option for me, and probably the best fit for the mount arm).The most SALIENT advice I can offer any consumer of an LCD arm - this one or any other - is to be very careful when pairing it with a monitor. When shopping for monitors at retail,  pay attention to the location of the VESA mount on the display. My monitor's mount is on the bottom of the pedestal that it usually stands upon independently. In order to attach the arm, I had to position the round pedestal vertically, then mount the arm on the base of the pedestal. For that reason, the weak link between the LX Desk Mount Arm and my monitor is my monitor's flimsy hardware. With the mount attached, my display is rather wobbly. Had I PURCHASED A DISPLAY WITH A VESA MOUNT OPPOSITE THE VIEWING SIDE (say. close to the center), I would likely have experienced no wobbliness. But because I didn't consider the physics before buying my display, about 1"" x 1/4"" x 3"" of thermoplastic supports my monitor rather tenuously after the very solid steel arm mounts to the pedestal mount. So make sure your monitor is of the rear-placed VESA mount variety - not of the sort described above.Finally, the integrated cable management system extends all the way until the last vertical arm - but it would be nice if if went, say, 180 degrees or something similar so the cables could be routed under the desk. But overall the product is great - and you will be shocked at the weight and ""meatiness"" of the product compared to others out there for sale on Amazon which I have seen and touched.Don't be afraid to take the plunge even though this item ""seems"" pricey - this is about as near perfect as you're going to get when it comes to a strong, reliable, durable, and well engineered monitor arm. Every time I end up purchasing a relatively expensive item that I've extensively researched, I am reminded that the maxim ""you have to pay for quality"" is still true. And finally - make sure that you have a VESA mount on the rear of your monitor - not on a pedestal base - or be prepared for the wobbles.",1

M. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022","TL;DR: want the white version?  Want to mount directly to the desk, without a clamp?  You'll need another part, and that's neither inexpensive nor easy to figure out.First, I'm happy with the arm, basically.  It isn't quite as easy to relocate as I'd hoped, but I've been tinkering with adjustments and I'm getting close to what I want.However, I have a major issue to emphasize, and it's about the depictions of arm and mount in many of the photos.  As an example, look at the primary image of the white arm.  What isn't obvious is how the arm is attached to the surface on which it is mounted.What is shown is the nicest and most professional installation of the system, which is where the base is attached via a ""grommet"" mount; basically a hole is drilled or otherwise reused and you have what is pictured - the arm attached to a base.  However, it is important to know that the white arm does NOT COME WITH THE NECESSARY HARDWARE TO INSTALL IT IN THIS MANNER.  It DOES come with a desk clamp, but the first three images don't show this.  More to the point, the parts necessary for cleanly mounting the arm via a hole in the work surface are much less complicated and ought to be less costly to manufacture and ship than the fairly beefy clamp that is included.The page does, far into the detail section, have this text: ""For White arm model, order separate grommet mount accessory.""  But it's really rather unusual to have the same item packaged differently depending on the color choice; after all there's a color choice option that one might change after already having read through the entire description, and it's easy to miss the fact that ordering a white version actually results in different parts in the box.It also makes, for example, the white version $20-35 more expensive than the polished aluminum.  And - then the question, if you really want the white model, what is the ""separate grommet mount accessory"" that is mentioned?This is an e-commerce site.  Why is there no link to the correct part?  If you go to the Ergotron site, find the part number needed (for the record, it's ‎98-035), type that in the search box - you get two parts that appear to be identical other than the cost, but one is 98-034 - which will NOT fit the base.The arm is nice.  The Ergotron site is complete - but relying on the photos of the white model and ordering without understanding that your only choice is to use a clamp unless you find and order another mounting option is not satisfactory.  Hopefully this might help at least one other buyer.",-1

I bought the 8” pole but you should just get the taller pole. It was my fault for getting the shorter pole, but my vesa mounting holes are towards the top half of my monitor so it doesn’t sit high enough for my seating position and size. I reached out to support to try and buy the taller pole but they only sell it as a kit for like $80-100+ which basically replaces the whole stand and not even in solid black.My new project is finding a metal fab near me to make me a new tube because the size is between two standards at Home Depot. Glad they asked me if the pole had threads because I didn’t remember it having any.. it does.. so even if I had to buy an 8 foot pole for two feet I’d still have to find someone to match the threads.I would recommend buying the tall stand and not using all of it instead of buying the shorter one and wishing you had an extra couple inches. It will be future proof and could have the option to add a second monitor if you’d prefer.",-1

Paluda III,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2022","I'm using two of these.  One for an Asus PG279Q and the other for an LG 34GN850 curved ultrawide.  I needed arms that could extend at least 20-25 inches to keep them in a good position while using simming peripherals that push me back almost a foot from the desk.  These definitely have the reach.I went with the permanent install via drilling a hole instead of the clamp type install.  The kit comes with all the hardware you need for this and was easy to swap.  The only tools you need that aren't included are a phillips head screwdriver and a drill.The arms very sturdy and I have no doubt they would hold up to the 25lbs listed in the spec.  If you have a lighter monitor you will likely need to back off the tension all the way.  My Asus is 1 pound over the 7lb minimum, and I had to do this to make it easy to move up and down.The only two things keeping this from a 5 star review are that the cable management for the upper arm piece is pretty bad.  They include two zip ties to just tie the cabled to spots on it.  The bottom arm at the mount base actually has a removable cover though.  The other thing is they are not that easy to push in or pull out horizontally because the arms go together by just sliding onto the base and the upper arm sliding onto the lower arm.There's no bearing, just a plastic sleeve that is split on one side and a set screw with a springy metal piece that gets pushed against the sleeve to add some drag to the rotation.  Also, once you put the arms together with weight on them, that sleeve WILL fall out if you take the arm back off the joint.  Not only that but that springy metal square will go flying out of its slot as it's held in place by the lip of the sleeve.  The sleeve is initially held in place by a bit of double sided clear tape on one edge and that's it.",1

Having had an imac and thunderbolt displays on them for years they have not lost a single gram of tension.  They have never sagged and are rock solid.  One thing i noticed is i went to buy more and amazon has this exact monitor arm under thier basics brand in solid black.  I bought two of those and they are georgeous.Excellent value for the money. I used this arm to mount my 27"" imac late 2011 and two thunderbolt monitors (separate arms for each one).  I hope this helps you if you are considering but worried about weight.  I was but decided to try it out.  Technically the 27"" imac fits the weight requirement barely so I was a little skeptical on stability.  I used the desk mount version to mount the imac (logistics reasons only) and used the wall mount to hang the two 27"" thunderbolt displays to the right and left (again mounting logistics).  It is solid and will work for you so long as you follow the manufacturers guidelines and dont need it to extend more than it is designed ( felt i needed a disclaimer there:)The arm is amazing for its reach flexibilty and positioning.  A few tension adjustments and your monitor just floats perfectly. For the Imac you will want almost max on both height and tilt.  I had some ibm arms that i paid over $300 each for and they did not have nearly the adjustment range.  I ended up getting the extension arm for this mount and it provides almost infinite config options.  I highly recommend it but you need to be careful you dont fully extent because at almost 3 feet out the leverage and weight become sketchy.  I use the extension just as an articulation point to get a couple extra inches so it rests almost on top of the original kit.The arm is brilliant in terms of design because its super simple to adjust tensions so they work.  Its also A great value for the money.  It gets even a 27"" imac where you need it floating above your desk.  I bought three of these for the price of one of the ibm mounts granted this was 3 years ago.My only issue is with the finish on the metal.  If you are going to highlight silver make sure its clean and not marked up when you ship.  When I opened the item I noticed a bunch of marks on the shiny silver pieces of the arm.  Not a deal breaker but a bummer when you get a new item.  It should look like new right?  That said the arms are behind the monitors and I dont really care what they look like because they are doing the job. so thats why the get a 4.5 stars.  If i was buying for looks and not function this would get a 2 star rating. I would actually just prefer an all black arm so they dont stand out and it would eliminate the issues on the finish.",1

I was also unable to find an add-on solution offered by Ergotron (if someone knows of one, please leave a comment with the details).Pros:- Looks good.- Stays where you set it.- Good price for the quality.- Tension adjustments for all articulations (except 360 screen rotation and pan).- Easy to assemble (helpful step-by-step assembly video is available on the Ergotron website).Cons:Note - If you don't have an issue with the arm protruding beyond the back of the desk, neither item listed below should be an issue for you (so it's safe to disregard both).- No 180 degree rotation stop option - If your desk backs to a wall that you don't want marked/dented by the arm repeatedly hitting it when you put the monitor in its fully retracted position (or if you just don't want the arm protruding beyond the back of your desk for whatever reason), this product falls short. For my application, the arm would be greatly improved if Ergotron had engineered a solution for this common issue. After giving it some thought, I was able to come up with a very simple way to keep the arm from damaging my wall by placing 3/4"" adhesive vinyl bumpers on the ends of the upper and lower arms (see pics). Now the soft bumper contacts the wall rather than the metal arm. I also added another bumper to the upper arm where it comes into contact with the ""Tall Pole"" when the monitor is put in a low position and then retracted (see pics).- No pan tension adjustment - It appears this product intends the pan motion to be accomplished primarily via the tension-adjustable joints in lower arm rather than the non-adjustable pan joint nearest the monitor. There's no issue when the arm is mostly extended because the lower arm does not contact the wall while panning. However, when the arm is retracted, the (very stiff) pan joint nearest the monitor will not move before the joint in the lower arm does. So when panning in the retracted position, the lower arm uses the wall as a leverage point. In the absence of a mechanical rotation stop, it would be nice to be able to adjust the tension in the upper pan joint so that it would move there more easily (instead of all the movement taking place in the lower arm).Also, if it hasn't already occurred to you, it's probably a good idea to take some measurements to be sure your current monitor cable will be long enough. Because of the extra length this arm adds when extended, you may want to consider buying a longer monitor cable at the same time you buy the arm. Standard monitor cables are about 5-6' and unless your monitor is very close to your machine, a standard cable might be too short.If I haven't added an update to the top of this review, this product is still working out great for me.",1

Gamut,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2012","I really like the quality of these Ergotron arms. They are less expensive than those by Humanscale, they offer more add-on options, and they look great. The packaging was perfect and they provide enough hardware to bolt-mount or clamp the arms, even providing extra screws. The instructions were above average compared to what we usually get with hardware and other equipment these days.I am giving these four instead of five only because they are still not tall enough, even being the tall version of these poles. I have a console desk (you know, the ones that have a monitor riser built-in) and I used these to expand it to accommodate both standing and sitting work situations. The height of the console desk is a standard 40 inches and these arms/posts are just three inches shy of putting the monitors where a six-foot person needs them to be when standing and with the arms extended to maximum height, positioned at the top of the poles, and with all four mounting points bolted. I wound up inserting an inch-thick board on top of the surface where the clamp attaches (the surface is glass anyhow, bottom of the clamp gripping the metal chassis) and I bolted the top edge of the mounting bracket to the bottom two holes on the monitors as a quick fix. This works for now when I adjust the height from the arm and *not* the monitor, but I am still going to need to add some more metal reinforcement so that someone unaware of this doesn't break the monitor's plastic backing. I am not comfortable with only two of the four mount points being used anyhow. I also wish that the clamp could have been extended an additional inch but I doubt that Ergotron's engineers predicted that their monitor arms would be used for this type of solution. (hey guys, if you're reading this, here is a cool way to use your product and you're oh-so-close to being ready for this, out of the box!)Although I could have just gotten a single arm with the dual-monitor version, I got two of these to mount each of my two monitors independently and from the opposing left and right edges of my desktop.",1

Well made, does not feel cheap at all and I can trust it with my expensive monitor. It's nice having the monitor at a comfortable height and distance.I used the clamp desk mount option and did not drill any holes. It was not clear if the desk mount would leave any permanent marks on the desk surface, so I used a very thin cardboard spacer just in case.I gave it a 4/5 rating because the directions are image-based, no written words so they can be used internationally. The drawback is that they are cryptic and lack depth, so it took a while to figure out how to fix the height so no movement occurred. Also, what little print there is, is very small, just like all the instructions for many other products - I guess they don't use people over 40 in testing. However, there are several videos posted that are very helpful, so if the directions don't get you up an running in 5 minutes, check them out.",1

For a long time I had my 24"" Dell LCD on the top shelf and my midi keyboard on the second shelf.  I could push the midi keyboard back and work on the bottom shelf.  Was great for working and music recording.  However, as I get older I found myself having to tilt my head to get the mid and/or reading part of my glasses to see the monitor.  I tried computer glasses, but they didn't seem to work, and seeing as they would have to constantly be replaced, I was looking for another solution.  I put the monitor on the lower shelf and that helped, but it took away my workspace and I had to lift it up when I needed my midi keyboard.  So I looked for a desk arm and decided on this one.  I have it mounted on the back of the top shelf and it reaches over the top shelf and the monitor is about 2"" from the bottom desk.  I can move it out of the way when I need to record work.  I will try to get a video review up showing how I am using the monitor.Anyway, I couldn't find any info on my monitor, so I estimated the weight (Lazy, didn't disconnect it and weigh it).  I would say the Dell is a little over 10lbs, so the arm won't always keep it in position.  However, I find this a minor issue,  In my daily hover over the desktop, I'm at an equilibrium point and the monitor sits a few inches off the bottom desk.  If I need to put it up, and can rest it on the top shelf.I am entertaining the idea of getting windows 8.  If I do I will be getting a touch monitor and the 2 arm LCD mount.  I am happy very happy with the construction and quality of this mount and will buy from this company again.Feel free to ask any questions on my setup.CheersJim",1

Its always a little nerve racking mounting a very expensive cintiq (I have the 22hd) on anything other than what was built specifically to hold it. In the end, however, I forget that I ever used anything else. It feels extremely natural to pull the screen down to your lap and work on it at any angle you feel like. I was amazed to find that it held my desired angle even when I was drawing on it (which is the whole point of course).There were two disappointments that I had with the device. The first is that the instructions came somewhat shredded. Almost in a comical fashion. I basically have the outside borders and the middle has been ripped out. Its not floating around in the box somewhere either. Its just gone. Now, this isn't a particularly complicated device and moreover the directions can probably be found online somewhere, it was just annoying. The second problem I'm having is that it wont keep the monitor more than about two inches off the desk. This cintiq is heavy, almost at the limit, but it seems like it should hold to a place I move it. That said, I dont ever have to raise it and it holds extremely well in all the drawing positions I use, which are usually pulled forward into my lap, so its not even a big enough deal for me to search online and see if the fix is somewhere in the missing chunk of instructions.If you use a 22hd with the stock stand, you need this in your life. It feels so much more natural, like the way a cintiq is meant to be experienced. I get full 360 degree rotation at any angle I like, and for that reason alone I can't imagine going back to the stock stand.PS. my setup actually has the arm attached to the table on the right side of my desk instead of the back of the desk. It works just fine. I'll upload some pictures as well.",1

I turned the tension screw all the way clockwise, counterclockwise and in many positions in between. I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out and if there was a solution online. The box did have an extra strip of moving tape on it, nothing like manufacturers use. I think I got the previous reviewer's return!UPDATE (4 stars): After almost ordering the Amazon brand to replace this one, I read from a review of the Amazon arm that it is a rebranded Ergotron.  Also, one of the reviewers wrote a tip to give it a lot of force, if it seems stuck.  I was already applying so much force, I thought I'd break it.  I also found the manual for a different Ergotron model that actually said to turn the screw ""counterclockwise"" loosen the joint.  The manual for this LX model has drawings of arrows, which look like the opposite direction is true.  So after playing with it some more, it began to budge.  I really had to use some strength, but then it gets a little smoother after that.  It never gets to the point where the joints feel light like it does in the instructional videos when it bends by the weight of the monitor.  Maybe mine happened to be a really tight one.",0

I confirmed on the Ergotron website that the arm was able to support my monitor (Please make sure you verify which Ergotron arm supports your monitor -- it does make a difference!)[...]Do not just look at the weight capacities of the arm, the thickness of the monitor also impacts how much weight the arm can hold because the thickness shifts the center of gravity.It comes very well packaged and when you first look at it, it is very impressive.  It is heavy and just a beautiful piece of engineering.  The assembly instructions are actually very easy, the pictogram they provide is unnecessarily convoluted and would be greatly enhanced with just some written words.  There is an online video on their site that does a good job explaining how to assemble and use the arm.I used the edge-clamp assembly and it is very sturdy and not intrusive at all on my desk.  I can not imagine this ever coming unstable; it feels now part of my desk.There are few things I would have liked to see better executed on for the arm:1. After assembly the arm kept on falling down and was unable to support my monitor.  I called their customer support and he walked me through a how to tighten the arm-tensioner with a hex-key provided with the arm.  I would have preferred it was tensioned in the factory better, but also there is no mention of this tensioner in the manual provided.  I would have never found it myself without calling their customer-support.  BTW, their customer support was excellent.2. The cable-tray built into the lower-arm is too small; it can barely hold the wires to my monitor.  Also the ""cable-ties"" on the upper seem like a last minute-hack.  You spend all this time and effort designing this beautiful arm and it is somewhat ruined by the cables being hung from the upper-arm with zip-ties.I would definitely but it again.",1

Once I applied the proper amount of tension it held the Cintiq like a champ and I can now position the display in more useful positions for drawing and clear more space on my desk if need be. The arm is high quality, solid metal. Feels very sturdy and looks sleek. The wire containment also worked well for the Cintiq's thick cable.The only negative I can give the arm is that the mounting options aren't flexible enough. If it's physically possible (and it may not be) it would be nice if the clamp could work up to 3.5 inches for thicker desks. Also, it would be nice if they included multiple carriage bolts with different lengths. I had to drill a hole into my desk that led to a drawer and the included carriage bolt was simply too long and stopped the drawer from opening, so I went out and purchased a shorter carriage bolt and that did the trick. It would be nice if maybe they offered accessories like this on their site (or suggestions).Overall, for the price, this is a great solution for mounting a Cintiq and getting that beast into a good, natural position for drawing. Only time will tell if the arm maintains its level of sturdiness.",1

I addition to internet searches, I checked several similar products at Frys, Staples, & Office Depot. All of these I found to be  overpriced and/or functionally inadequate or inferior to this product.  At this point in time, this product seems to offer the best price/feature ratio.After doing the research, I decided to try the Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm 45-241-026. I've been using this device for one week now.  I would recommend it.  Here's why:PROS:1. Relatively fast/easy to install out of the box.2. All key components are die cast or stamped metal.  Only the two trim caps and the cable tray on the back arm section are plastic.3. Provides up to 24"" extension from the base.4. Functions very smoothly, allows for monitor placement in any position.5. Seems durable. I would expect an above-average service life for this product.6. VESA mount compatible (400 mm/4 hole).7. Well designed and engineered, with a sleek ""hi-tech"" appearance.8. Includes parts for either ""clamp on"" or ""through desk top"" mounting. I used the ""through desk top"" for maximum reach and the mounting is very solid.CONS:1. A bit pricey, but probably worth it if it lasts as long as I expect it to.2. The cable management on the ""forearm"" consists of 2 tie wraps. A simple snap-in plastic tray (like the back arm) would look much better and only add a few pennies to the production unit cost. However, this is a minor point.3. There is a slight, momentary LCD wobble when the arm/monitor is repositioned, but again this is a minor point.After combining this monitor arm with a good slide out keyboard tray, a good workstation chair, and an ergonomic mouse, I'm much more comfortable at my computer.",1

I use more than 1 of these.So they are worth while. However they aren't as flexible in their use as one might think.Or at least I expected more from them than they provide.It's plagued a little I think by some lack of imagination in the design.Part of which makes the tall pole more useful.Some things that are not so obvious about any of this type of arm:1) the really high position it seems to be holding the picture is really at about the same height as the monitor would be on it's own stand.2) That's almost as high it will let you raise it using just the arm motion3) it won't let you face the monitor downward much. At most maybe 10 or 15 degrees. So you can't set this up next to a low seat or a bed and then position it so you're looking up at it.4) the monitors are rigidly in place. it you bump or tap them, they will jiggle and bounce.The tall pole version at least allows you to start it at a high level than normal so you sort of get to raise the monitor above the height your stand would have allowed.But the pole still doesn't allow the monitor to face down.So overall nice to have but a bit of a let down because they seem like the should have more degrees freedom in their movement than they actually do.",0

First 3x Dell U2415 on a horizontal only 3 screen mount. Then 1x U2415 and a U3415W on a 2 screen horizontal only mount. Now due to some neck and back strain that I am trying to alleviate, I've moved the U3415W to this Ergotron.It assembled easily. I opted for the 13"" over the 8"" pole, to maximize available height. And it's good that I did, since my widescreen is now only just slightly above eye level with my preferred chair and arm position.I figured this would wobble quite a bit -- but was pleasantly surprised that it doesn't as much as I thought. And, like I saw somewhere on the product page, it does hold my 35 lbs widescreen, after tensioning the raise arm appropriately.My only complaint is that that 13"" pole version is a whopping $60 more than the 8"".",1

I didn't purchase the extension, but I liked having the option if the mounting didn't work out right.It was easy to install on my desk, and when tightened down the base becomes very solid.  The arms installed easily, and it was equally easy to connect my LCD panel with the included thumbscrews.  Hand tighten the thumbscrews, but be careful not to over tighten.  I over tightened one of the thumbscrews and it became a little deformed. Not a big deal, and is still works fine.The one place where this arm loses a star is in the system for concealing cabling.  The lower arm is great, with the wiring running inside of a channel with a cover that you can snap on or off.  The upper arm is another matter entirely.  It also has a channel for the wiring, but instead of using a removable cover, they put a hook on each end of the arm and the only way to secure the wiring is with a pair of zip-ties.  Really bad design, since if you ever want to change something you have to cut both zip ties, something which isn't really easy, and replace them afterward.By the way, there are two versions of this, a short pole version and a tall pole version.",1

McGowan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2011","The instructions aren't the best, but the product is fine.  You'll figure out the installation just fine; take your time and hold the parts in your hands to visualize proper assembly.  However, do read the instructions and heed the warning about removing certain screws!For mounting ASUS 24-inch LCD monitors, the factory tension settings worked fine.  Tighten clamp to desk, install first arm, screw second arm to appropriate holes on monitor (the ASUS had VESA mounting holes) and then slip the two arms together.  Attaching power and signal cables to the arms is the final step.I bought two of these and clamped one to my wife's old-style wooden desk and one to my converted drafting table.  Both installed without the need for any additional spacers or force-spreading devices (think wood or metal block to expand the footprint of the clamp plate).The desk sits about ¾-inch away from a wall.  Moving that heavy wooden desk to reach the knob for tightening clamp was not appealing, so I made a tool from 2-inch schedule 40 PVC pipe.  Just trace the clamp fingers onto one end of the pipe and saw out the waste with a hacksaw (about ½-inch deep or so).  Space the fingers so they fit snuggly on the clamp, so the tool doesn't slip off while you are reaching in from the bottom middle front-side of the desk.  Clamp tightened fine, and all is well.  I left the tool in place behind desk, so I could find it, should the need arise to remove or adjust clamp.",1

Sturdy enough. I wish I got the HX arm as it wobbles a bit when I type on my standing desk, but admittedly, I SLAM my fingers when typing. Should be more than OK for most cases. Only thing that really bothered me was the assembly. I stripped the allen bolt that is used for the stop/height adjustment on the rod, and its stuck too high up on the rod to fit the middle arm attachment and the screen arm attachment, so I had to skip out on the middle arm for now. Will need to use special tools to remove that bolt, and then find the same bolt elsewhere since it didn't come with extras. Ultimately my own fault, but there could've been preventative instructions and spare bolts to go along. Just something to keep in mind when assembling.",1

You have to adjust the Lift arm quite a bit from the factory setting to get the monitor to float properly, but once you have it dialed in it handles it perfectly fine.

The included bracket didn't extend far enough around the lip and still have enough screw to keep it tight. The lip is about 2.5"" tall, and 1.5"" deep.My solution was to take a 1""X6"" board to place out of sight under the lip, so the screw had something to tighten onto. This has worked just fine.In reality, the screw is hardly needed since the weight of the base sitting on the desk is enough to keep the monitor stable. But, if you're like me and want things secure, it works.The only other limitation I feel the arm has is the cable management. It is kind of an awkward set up to have zip ties on one part of the arm and a nice tuck space on the other.",1

The arm is very sturdy and solid.  I was prepared to mount it onto my Ikea work table by drilling and using the supplied hardware, but the clamp mounting is more than adequate to hold the arm and monitor.  The primary reason for the Ergotron arm is to move the monitor for viewing while working out on exercise equipment in the room.  The monitor has a hookup to a desktop computer as well as an HD switcher for DirecTV or PlayStation 3, so there are four cables running from the back of the monitor and I attached them to the arm with a tie.  It is not a real space saver for the desktop, since there must be available room for the arm to swing into place when moved, but this wasn't a concern for my setup.  The installation was pretty easy and intuitive, with the only challenge posed by finding the adjustment screw for keeping a heavy monitor in place.  My keyboard is setup on a desktop separate from the mounted table, so there isn't any shaking of the monitor, but slight monitor movement could be a concern if the mounted table wasn't solid and heavy.  I'd recommend the arm for most uses.",1

The instructions consist of a detailed diagram, but it was relatively easy to figure out. The mount fit my monitor, and the screws were the right diameter, but too long--they could not be screwed in all the way, and the monitor wobbled. I solved the problem by placing rubber faucet washers around the screws, between the mounting plate and the monitor back. I had them on hand, so it wasn't a big deal, but I think washers should be included for just such situations.The joints have just the right amount of ""stiffness"" to be easy enough to move when you want to, but stay strongly in position  My one quibble is that to change the height you need to unscrew the retaining band using the tiny allen wrench that was included. The screw is probably necessary for stability, but they should have made it a thumbscrew so we don't have to fish out the wrench all the time (and it's probably going to get lost eventually anyway).Overall, this is an excellent product that I am glad I purchased.",1

I have had it for several months now, and overall I am very pleased with the purchase. I initially bought it to add some height to my monitor and I liked the idea of being able to position it however I want. I have a 24 inch Dell monitor connected to it and it works great. However, I would echo prior reviewers in that the pole is a little short and the range of motion is a little less than what I had imagined. It seems to me that if they could lengthen it to allow users the option of more height for their monitor if they desire. It would be nice if they had some sort of rotation stop that would allow you to click your monitor in to perfectly horizontal and vertical positions, but that is not a big deal. I have noticed some shaking if I bump the desk, but it is not bad and generally the monitor sits solidly. The cable management ties are a joke because I screwed up on my first attempt. A dollar at Lowes for a pack of these solved the problem nicely.  Overall, I would buy again because it works, looks great, and has given me back my desk space.",1

My desk has a shelf the monitor sits on and with the leverage of a 23"" LCD it was twisting the flimsy shelf on my desk.  Wall mounting worked out surprisingly well.  Just remove the clamp and screw it right to the wall.  I used all 6 holes with 3"" lags.  There is a small amount of flex when using it this way due to all the weight not being transferred to a desktop.  The L bracket is fairly thick and shows no signs of bending after months of use.  The arms have adjustments for controlling the amount of force it takes to move each section.  Tons of flexibility.  I move it 180 degrees daily depending on whether or not the LCD is being used as a TV or as a monitor.  Definitely a well made solid product.  Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack-luster wiring management.  I used spiral wrap around the wires I ran to my LCD (DVI, component, RG6, audio, power) which looks ok.",1

The ability to bring the monitor off the table edge and into my lap is extremely satisfying for sketching with normal posture.  The quality of the build and ease of setup is superb; I've had no problems and no complaints.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because you have to tweak the tension of keeping the monitor up (meaning, the arm will prevent the monitor from sagging).  This tweak has to be balanced with the ease of mobility.  What this ultimately means is: the monitor will hold its position... but if you pull it out too far and don't rest part of the monitor on a desk, the monitor will ""bounce"" while sketching.

I bought this (and a separate mounting bracket that is needed) to hold up a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD based on many user review recommendations. Unfortunately it only sort of works for this purpose. While it moves easily and you can tilt the Cintiq no problem, it still seems too heavy for the arm. I have to make sure it stays rested on my desk surface other wise it slowly droops down, and for some reason it wants to tilt to the (your) left if unsupported (yes I have tightened the thing almost to breaking as well).

Gay,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2011","I have two of these and mounted a 27"" Viewsonic monitor on each. The monitors do not allow for the bracket (a 4 hole bracket) to be mounted on the center, so the mount is slightly to the side. This wouldn't be a problem except the screw to prevent the screen from rotating doesn't fit snuggly and allows about 1 degree of rotation. This was fixed by adding a bit of wire around the screw. Once that was rigged up, I have spent several days trying to find the exact right tension for the set screws to allow me to still move the monitors, but have the monitors not slowly droop. At this point I have it so that I don't notice the droop in real time, but the next day the monitor isn't where I left it.Gravity does always win. And I'm sure there is a way to get just the right tension, but so far I've always found too tight or too loose.",-1

I'm using it to hold a 20-inch LCD monitor--mostly in a vertical, or portrait, orientation--and it easily supports this weight. It's easy to move to a new position or orientation, and once there, it doesn't move around.Assembling the arm was more difficult than it needed to be. The included printed instructions were ambiguous, and I finally went to the manufacturer's website to view a video of someone assembling the arm. This quickly cleared up my confusion, and the arm then went together nicely.The arm comes with two sets of mounting hardware, one for through-hole desktop mounting and the other for mounting on the desk edge. I used the latter, and like the rest of the hardware, it's quite sturdy. Two allen wrenches are included, which are needed for assembly. Large thumbscrews make attachment of the arm to the back of the monitor very easy.",1

Since I wanted to put a 27"" monitor on it, I wanted to make sure I found one that was strong and well made. This one certainly does the job! As others have noted, the one complaint I have is that the mounting post isn't very tall, and since the joints don't move upward very far, the highest I can raise the 27"" monitor is about 5"" above the desk. If I could raise it just 3 or 4 more inches, that would have been great, but all things considered it's just a minor detail. It's strong and stays where you put it.

The instructions say to insert a screw (provided) into a hole on the monitor mount plate if you don't want to rotate the monitor between horizontal/vertical. However, the hole shown in the instructions is not in the same location as the one on the mount plate, and when I insert the screw into the only hole that goes all the way through the rotating and stationary parts of the mount plate, the monitor is still rotates up to 15 degrees.

It just wasn't made quite that well, and did not have the positioning abilities that I wanted, plus it wasn't tall enough for my standing desk. This arm is much, much better - it's very well made and holds my monitor very securely. It's also very easy to move the monitor to just about any position I want with very little effort. So it works for my stand up/sit down workstation, which is just what I needed. Why four stars? Because I am 5'2"" tall and this are does not have the height I was looking for. Unless there's an adjustment that I don't know about, maybe. From what I've seen, it looks like the top arm is at its highest position just like in the picture on Amazon. I can get the monitor to go down, but no further up. It's impossible to tell from the very scanty instructions which joints are repositionable and which aren't, so maybe I just don't know how to get it to go higher.  And I also may be too picky, but I want my monitor at eye height so I don't have to look down at all, I want to be able to look straight ahead and have my information straight in front of me.  This arm is about 3"" too short of that. So I have the extension arm on order, and am hoping that will give me the extra couple of inches I want for this arm to be perfect for me. However, this is just a personal preference. Other than that, this is a great piece of equipment, it looks like it's built to last forever!!!! Easy to install, too, even with the crappy instructions. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to be able to reposition a computer monitor regularly, especially if you're in a stand up/sit down workstation like I am. This arm is just perfect for that, with the exception of the height problem. And that may not be a problem for anyone else. If anyone out there knows how to adjust that top arm to go higher than the approximately 45 degree angle it's at please let me know!  Overall, very well worth the money and I'm glad I shelled out the extra bucks to move up to this arm from the one I had.Update: I received the extension piece for this monitor arm that is sold here on Amazon. It's basically the same piece as the part that attaches to the pole. It took all of a minute to install and re-position my wiring, and the height problem was solved! Now my monitor is at eye height, which is exactly what I was trying to get accomplished. So now this is a five star review! If you're interested in the extension arm, it's the Ergotron 45-289-026 Mounting Extension. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but it solved my very irritating problem, so it was well worth the money. My workstation is now set up exactly the way I want it, with no eye, neck, or back strain from bending over just a little to get closer to my monitor screen. This is an excellent, heavy duty product and I can see no reason why it should ever need replacement. Here's the link:

The cheaper ones are no more than clugs with badly fitting parts and whose screws need to be loosened, if they haven't been stripped, if you want to move the monitor position. In its price range and above I haven't yet found a decent competitor except for the Humanscale M2 or M8. The LX is a well made, nicely designed, unit well worth the price.At first, it wouldn't hold my monitor up -- the upper arm kept sinking -- and yet my monitor, at 15.4 lbs., was well below the 20 lb. max capacity for this unit. The adjustment for the weight of the monitor is #2 on the scant pictographic instructions. The picture instructions are not the best--not the worst but. . . Anyway I searched for an adjustment to the spring-tension canister in the upper arm that counterbalances the monitor's weight. Pushing the upper arm up and the screen mount down reveals the adjustment screw head at the end of the canister and the larger supplied wrench fits it. 3 half-turns clockwise made no diff. So I added three more half-turns; better but still slowly sinking. I added a 3 more half-turns--much better. 3 more for a total of 12 half-turns and the balance was perfect. You need to ease your way up to the right number of turns to get it just right balance and to avoid overtightening. Once adjusted correctly, the montoro stays in palce but can be moved easily up and down.What's nice about this unit is that, once you have it set up, you can move the monitor around and up and down without readjusting the tension or loosening/retigthening any screws. Although, if your desk is on casters or wheels, you will want to lock them, which is a good safety rule anyway. The elevation movement is smooth and easy--you can move it up or down with one finger. The horizontal swing movement is much stiffer. It helps if you spray the two large post joints with silicone lubricant liberally and then wipe away thoroughly all of the excess. This won't make the swing movement light, but it does ease it up a bit. By post joints I mean the large joints where the upper arm meets the lower and were the lower arm meets the desk mounting post. These joints have no bearings; they have plastic sleeve-type bushings. Compared to the Humanscale: the Humanscale moves horizontally as easily as the LX moves vertically while the Humanscale moves vertically as stiffly as the LX moves horizonstally--either way I'm not sure the difference is worth the extra money for the Humanscale. This stiff horizontal movement is less than ideal but far better than what I've seen on some of the cheaper units offer. For this price I could live with stiffness given all the other postive features.The LX comes with a heavy duty clamp base and a drill-a-hole-in-the-desk grommet type mount--both come in the box. All of the parts are in a two-layer plastic strip, sealed into multiple compartments with each compartment labeled as to contents. Much better than those units that come with all the screws etc. all in one bag and you have to sort them by count and looks against their picture in the instructions.It's not quite as pretty as the Humanscale M2 or M8, which cost about 60% more, but much more nicely finished than the cheaper units I've seen up close. The LX, with less attractive desk mounting pole, has a greater range of vertical position than the Humanscale.If you can afford it, this monitor arm is a very good choice. If you can afford more, then it's a tough choice between this at its price vs the Humanscale arms at the higher prices. For the money, this is a much better deal, thus, my rating of 5 stars.",2

This arm is expensive, but honestly for something you can keep using its worth the premium.  I always thought a monitor arm is a monitor arm but this product changed my perception of that.This arm has very smooth motion, very easy to move it around and dial in the right setting you need for the situation. Once you got it positioned it is extremely sturdy and stays where you set it.  You can continually adjust this thing with ease, no need to mess with tension screws or jank actions.It looks slick in matte black, which is a lot nicer than the plastic or shiny materials used in other mounts.  Not really a big deal but its sometimes the small details.Installation was easier than any other arm i've installed. The parts are laid out properly and the way it goes together in parts is a lot more smooth than other designs.  Its pretty much 3 lego pieces and you're done, the base is just a base so its not top heavy while you're trying to secure it to your desk.  Monitor cant be nut locked in place so you have to remove the entire last segment to replace your screen, but that adds to the stability of the monitor as it doesn't shake at all.Having a screw to disable rotation is great for my OCD tendencies, you can get very slight rotation but getting it fully strait takes zero effort, no need for rulers.",2

It's very solidly built, fairly well thought out, and once set up it adjusts easily.  When I unpacked, I was surprised at how heavy it was -- it is really solid.  There are a couple of small caveats but they aren't enough to diminish my rating.First, the adjustment for the counter-spring for the vertical movement is next to impossible.  The design calls for inserting an Allen wrench into the area behind the joint where the monitor mounting plate is attached to engage the rod which controls the spring tension.  First, it is pointless to try the adjustment without the monitor in place since it is the monitor's weight one is attempting to counterbalance, and that means that the monitor will make it impossible to see into the recessed area where the wrench needs to go.  There is nothing in there to guide the wrench so it is practically impossible to fit it into the hex-head on the end of the rod.  Meanwhile, with the monitor and other parts of the arm in the way one cannot just continually turn the wrench -- one must turn it, then remove it and reorient it before inserting it again -- so even getting lucky at getting the wrench seated the first time won't help much.  Lucky for me that the factory setting was almost perfect for my monitor so I didn't have to monkey with this that much.  It is a bad design and I hope they are smart enough to change it for future offerings.My second caveat is really minor, but it just seems like they could have easily handled it better.  One installation option involves installing the arm on a surface by running a bolt in the platform of the arm through a hole in the table's surface and then using a wingnut to clamp a small plate underneath the mounting surface.  This works well but the bolt is very long -- I'm not sure why they need a bolt that long.  In my case, there was a drawer beneath the surface where I was mounting it and the excess length of the bolt interfered with the drawer.  One option to fix this is to use a shorter bolt -- that might not be easy to do, however.Where the bolt fits through the platform of the arm, it drops into a square hole and the bolt has a square section at the top of its shaft which locks into that square hole to keep the bolt from turning.  It might not be that easy to find a replacement bolt with that square section as I suspect that it is not a standard part.  Another option is to take a hack saw and cut off the excess portion of the bolt.  Unless there is sufficient room in the mounting area to accommodate a hack saw, this would entail mounting the arm, marking the place to cut the bolt and then removing the arm to retrieve the bolt (and one would likely need a vise to hold the bolt while cutting).  It would have been easy to avoid all of this, however.  The bolt itself is at the bottom of the hollow upright tube which the arm is mounted on -- if they had just welded a nut to the platform and threaded the bolt through a lock-nut, then the welded nut, it could be adjusted to whatever height was desired before installing.  To avoid having to install, mark the bolt, and then remove for adjustment, one could likely just estimate the length needed based on the surface on which it is to be mounted (to be fair, one could do the same with the hacksaw method but with the downside of needing to obtain a new bolt if the estimated length turned out to be too short).One last complaint involves the provisions for cable control -- the cavity in the arm for passing the cables is a little awkward to use and seems a bit small.  It works well enough, however -- the real problem is that there is nothing similar for the upper arm and since a little slack is needed in the cables to allow for moving the monitor around, angling the screen, etc., one is faced with having cables drooping down behind the monitor.  I alleviated this a bit by using some velcro ties to hold the cables to the upper arm so that the slack portion is only from the end of the arm to the monitor.These are minor quibbles, however, and only affect the setup.  Once the arm is in place and adjusted, it works great, easily holds my 22 inch monitor, and I am very happy with it.",1

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",2

It took me over an hour to get the cheaper ones setup, also I could never quite get them at the right height + depth + tilt all at the same time.With these it takes a few minutes tops to setup and you can place them in pretty much any position as long as you leave 1-3 inches of space behind your desk. Definitely recommend them if you can afford them but the budget ones will get you by. Generally I think this is a product you buy once.One recommendation I would make is for dual monitors getting two separate poles for more customizability. It's a bit more expensive but I've found sharing a pole can limit the range of motion if you have two large monitors.",1

I research things over and over and over....I know! it's a monitor mount! big deal! Right? Wrong. For me, not only does it have to work flawlessly, but it must look good and must provide a Chanel to run my wires through as to look as clean as possible.  I have set this up, moved it around numerous times and it always maintains proper tension, looks terrific and works flawlessly.  I have a 24"" LG monitor attached to it and could not be happier.  I recently bought another for my son heading to college...the adjustments to perfect it perfectly are wonderful.  I would not look at anything else.  Trust me! I have done the research, I took the risk and purchased it.  I assure you, if there was ONE thing I did not like, I would have sent it back.  It's not inexpensive so it better be right....and it is!

I've never used the included stand that came with my cintiq, and nor would I care to. The ergotron does everything a person could about want, better, faster, and easier. I can recline in my chair and pull the Cintiq into my lap, tilt it back and lay a picture book on 1 half of the screen *to ref draw from it*, or rotate my screen to stand vertical giving me a humongous tall drawing area, or even lifting the stand to put my screen up high so I can stand while drawing if I am in the mood for such, or move the screen to face any-which way in my living room as I see fit.A good arm mount like this just isn't for Cintiqs, everyone should have one of these who doesn't have a huge screen display! I can easily pull the screen down right into my face for reading small text in high res, move it up and tilt it to face downwards at me while reclining back in extreme comfort while gaming or watching movies, and easily push it back when I need to get up.  For drawing this thing is awesome. Being able to pull my screen right into my face is so handy for drawing as I look to study small details., but it's equally impressive for entertainment use. I at all times can have the screen exactly where I want and even positions I never even considered. Should people have this much power I wonder.? Are we ready as a society?The various sections of the arm are adjustable with the included tools, to make it as loose or as tight as you'd want. I did have to adjust the tension of each piece a little bit. Some were too tight, others too loose. Again this was easy to do, just follow the instructions and look at the diagrams carefully. I have seen no evidence of sagging or weakening, it's just as stiff as the day I got it, and even if it did start to loosen up, I can tighten the tension screws more. I have it tight enough that I don't move the screen while pushing the stylus pen on it, and yet loose enough that it takes very little muscle to put it into any position I want. Moving it or rotating to aid in drawing is so easy, easier then how it would work with the Cintiq's official included stand yet it also does so much more then it ever could.Wacom should partner up with these guys and include the Ergotron with all tablets light enough to work well with them. Speaking of which, I got a 22hd not only because it's cheaper then a 24hd, but also because I knew it would be a better fit for the ergotron and how I'd use it, in addition to being under the max weight limit. This ergotron arm is so strong, and I could easily tighten it up to support even more weight. It would not surprise me at all if it can work well with the 24hd if you took off its' monstrous 60 pound stand, but technically even then you will still be over the weight limit.The clamp base has holes in it, so you can also drill screws through it to make it more secure. I have not drilled any screws to reinforce it, nor would I want to. Like all pieces of this arm, the clamp is very heavy sturdy steal, and very tightly has been clamped into place. I tried to see if I could make it budge or make it slide around, and I can't. This is a much more solid stable clamp then the pictures show. The Cintiq and arm mount are not going to slip off and fall over unless my entire desk does. As stable as the ergotron is, there is a little shake as I press more firmly and work quickly with the stylus, but this isn't an issue imo, and a very small price to pay to have such a mobile screen.My only complaints after a month and a half of heavy use, is I do think the instructions could have been.... better.

W. Dietrich,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023","I've been using this daily for about a month now. I have an unusual setup for my computer ""station"" which is my recliner with this monitor arm attached to a printer table to the side of my chair. I swing the monitor to in front of me while working on the computer (by working I mean gaming) and anytime I get up I have to swing the monitor out of the way. It gets a lot of use every day. And whenever my cat wants to join in with ""working"" I lift the monitor up higher and tilt it down slightly so my cat can sleep on my chest and I can see over her.OK the nuts and bolts of it.It swings around easily, lifts up or down easily without moving on it's own and most importantly to me it stays tilted in whatever amount of tilt I give it. My old monitor holder would tilt completely face down all on it's own (then I would need to get the Allen wrench and push and pull it back into position and lock it down again), this one hasn't shown any tendency to do that at all. Nice.Assembly is easy. Clamp the base to a table (or drill a hole and use the hole mount) using the huge star shaped clamp screw, it's big enough to need just your hand and not need tools, next adjust the height of the arm stop if needed, the swing arm just slides over the base rod (no screws or bolts) and sits on top of the height adjustment. The second arm connects the same way as the first arm connected... slide it over the post on the first arm. The plate that attaches to the monitor comes with it's own screws that have huge knob heads that don't need tools to tighten. Then align the part attached to the monitor with the end of the swing arm and drop the big pin through the holes of both parts. That's it, all done except for connecting the power and video cables.I was planning to use the through the hole mount on this but tried first the table clamp. Glad I did because it works very well. The arm has a huge range of rotation... if it wasn't for the cabling to the monitor it could turn 360 degrees endlessly.  With the rod the arm sits on (which can be adjusted for height when clamped to the table top) and the two arm joints, one between the two arm sections and one for the monitor there is a wide range of adjustment to position the monitor. Plus the monitor can be adjusted side to side, rotated to portrait or land scape mode, moved up and down and tilted.The only thing that would prevent this monitor holder from being your perfect monitor holder would be if you don't have a table top to attach it to.",2

This mount is not a set-and-leave type, where you need to set it once and stick with that location.  You can adjust it as much as you want, and it holds position.  The only adjustment that may take some time to make is the position of the arm on the pole, because a ring underneath the arm must be adjusted to maintain the height position.  However, the height range without adjusting the arm is already pretty significant, and I do not see that it would be necessary to adjust the arm height on the pole very often.  Adjustments are smooth and they stick - I do not have problems with the monitor falling out of position after I adjust it.The other reason that I picked this particular unit (besides the ability to adjust frequently and easily) is the tall pole.  This provides a larger range of movement, and if your monitor is on the upper end of the rated size scale, you will probably need it.  I was really happy about this choice, and although I have  not really needed that extra height yet, I am really happy that I have the potential for it.When the mount arrived in the box, my first impression was that the parts were all solid and well-made, heavy construction.  Assembly was really easy (no-brainer) and when put together, it was clear that the quality construction was as solid as I thought, and all parts worked smoothly together and fit easily. Ergotron did not stinge on any of the parts - they are all solid, good quality.I mounted it to the desk with the clamp, instead of drilling holes, because the desk will be moved to a new apartment soon, and I want to have flexibility of placement in the new place.  The clamp provided good stability for my monitor, and I have had no problems with vibrations or the clamp slipping while I am adjusting.  I may leave it in the clamp even after moving, since I have not had any problems with it.I was torn about purchasing the dual mount so that I could have the flexibility of setting up dual monitors in the future, but ultimately decided not to.  Now that I have the mount, I realize that I can buy the same mount again and mount both arms on a single pole to achieve the same setup as the dual mount system.  Or I can set the mounts side by side.  So, I feel I made the right choice and I am not limited.Overall summary: highly recommend!Pros: quality parts, solid construction, easy assembly, easy adjustment, adjustments hold after you make them, extra height range with tall pole, choice between clamp or through-desk mounting, rotates freely between portrait and landscape viewing (fun fact - this rotational direction is not limited at all except by your cables that will wind up if you continue to rotate - you could keep rotating indefinitely if your monitor were cordless).Cons: takes a little more time to adjust the height position of the arm on the pole (this is no big deal for me). Also, having a wall directly behind the mount will limit movement away from you to some degree, because the arm will be restricted by the wall - you will not be able to retract it as far against the wall as you would if the desk were free-standing.  However, it seems obvious that you will not be able to achieve the full range of movement if there are obstructions.",2

The LX has a capacity rating of 20lbs, and it extends 2 feet. I'd be trusting the construction of it to hold up my $2000 tablet in the air safely! So you can't blame me. However, after receiving the LX in the mail, it was definitely far better built than I thought it would have been. No plastic parts -- all 100% (heavy) metal. It came with mount hardware to clamp onto the edge of your desk, or drill through your desk for inner-surface placement. I tried it on the edge of my desk first, and while the clamp held firm and showed no signs of falling off, let's face it, I'm taking no chances here. I also wanted a little more ""universal"" flexibility in accessing the cintiq, so it being off to the opposite edge of my desk was a little too far away. Thus, I measured out the optimal spot to drill a hole in my desk and mounted it SOLIDLY through the top. I have an IKEA Gallant corner desk, so I drilled it through right where the curved-corner area is. Drilled and bolted in place, there's absolutely 0% change of the clamp failing and falling off the desk, and the arm can reach both sides of the desk easily.(I'll be submitting some user pictures so you can see my Cintiq setup with the LX. Check them out!)So now with my 21UX on the LX, it allows me to ""float"" the 21UX in front of me, lowered to hang half-off the edge of my desk. It's basically in my lap by this point, offering me optimal ergonomic usage. I find myself no longer slouching when I draw, and I can withstand much longer sessions of drawing in my chair. It's nice that I can *float* the cintiq to where I need it, instead of moving to where it needs me to be.Another reviewer here on Amazon wrote that the LX had a hard time holding up his 21UX, and it would slowly droop over time from the weight. I'm wondering if he carefully tightened the primary tension bolt at the top of the arm? I had to put a lot of tension into the arm, at roughly around 85% tightened. But at that amount, the LX holds the 21UX unbelievably firm, in the air or lowered onto my desk in drawing position.Really you can't go wrong with the Ergotron LX. I'm literally using it with, probably, the toughest thing it will ever have to go up against. I feel safe with my 21UX mounted to it. It's that solid. Sure, there's a little bit of wobble if it's free floating -- but it's nothing that appears concerning, not like the thing's about to break or something. In fact, the Ergotron wobbles less with the Cintiq on it than my NEC monitor on its stock stand. How's that for overbuilt?It's really worth the investment for all 21UX owners who want some greater control over this behemoth. I even recommend it as a top-notch (and good looking) option to those looking for articulate arms for their normal LCD monitors, or hell, even your 12WX if you got one. Ergotron makes other attachments for the arm, such as extenders and a laptop tray. You can really make it work for your workspace well. It's nice being able to simply push the Cintiq out of the way to be up next to my primary monitor when it's not in use. It's nice to reclaim some of that desk space since the Ergotron mount has considerably less footprint than the Cintiq on its stock stand.Stop looking, get this mount. You won't find a better one for this weight range.",2

I plan on ordering a 3rd. They are expensive but I definitely feel like it’s worth the extra money. They are extremely simple to set up and even easier to adjust tension. Mine are holding up two 32” monitors with ease. The desk footprint is a bit larger than others I have used but they definitely feel more sturdy with the extra contact area to desk. The white and grey match my pc and monitor. I think they are much better looking than black ones. My only complaint would be that when fully raised the center of the monitor is not exactly the center of pole. It’s offset by 3/4” when pushed all the way back.  That could be because of the geometry of my monitor and no fault of the stand. My monitor is pretty wideFront to back so it may line up with a slimmer model.,2

I have to concur.This thing is a beast, made of solid aluminum and made with heavy-duty metal springs and joints, and while it says the rated weight is 20-25 pounds, I am fairly certain it is strong enough to hold far more (But dont quote me on that), as the 27QHD weighs just shy of 20 pounds and this thing does not even flinch when holding it in any position. It takes a bit of getting use to in order to properly attune it to the weight, but that goes for anything you put on it really. It also has wire management that allows you to run cops from the monitor through the frame of the arm itself, a couple twist ties for cord management, etc.Which is another advantage this arm has over the stand: Positioning. While the Ergostand may be more stable overall, it can only move the screen vertically a small bit. The Ergotron XL Arm has much better movement and range, such as actually lifting it up so you can stand and use it at a comfortable height, move the screen to the side so you have space for other things when not in use, or even being able to completely rotate the screen around, which for a digital tablet is absolutely useful for getting those perfect strokes without having to mess with the actual application orientation, or for getting the right shape screen you would prefer, such as preferring ""Portrait"" over 'Landscape"", for example. For someone that has to use this thing for hours and hours every day, the mobility the Arm affords you is indispensable for comfort and flexibility.I believe the weight rating applies to the fact that with enough weight on the end of this thing floating around, it will be putting quite a bit of strain on the desk/table/whatever to which it is mounted, potentially causing enough strain to break the desk/table/whatever.  Considering that whatever is attached to this thing most likely costs at least as much as the arm itself, I would assume you do not want that happening. However, even just the arms neutral position (Letting the top arm rest on top of the mounting bar) holds the monitor fairly well and still provides a wider range of motion than the Ergostand while not putting as much pressure on the desk as if the arm were extended.For this particular device I had to use an adapter since the base VESA screws for this arm are only 100x100, but thats not a big deal, it works well with any adapter.Overall very pleased with this purchase, a good investment no doubt.",2

Had to fiddle with it once the tablet was mounted so i could access some of the tension spots but watching videos helps.Im using it with a long ikea desk (1 inch thick) and my cintiq pro 24"". It holds the weight perfectly and i can draw without it moving around unexpectedly.However, im mounting it in a way that isnt shown in the manual (so the rating is still good, the product is fine... My desk is not) but if you are planning something similar to me, know that an ikea desk WILL NOT hold the weight of a heavier tablet or monitor.My current desk set up consists of 2 monitors and a cintiq 22hd (none mounted) and I was using the arm to give myself space for the cintiq pro. Since i also stream, i needed it placed in a way that allowed me to move it out of sight as needed.I placed the arm on the front of the desk, about 6 inches from the right side. It held up fine without the tablet and easily moved around my monitors, to my chair, and out of the way again.However, the cintiq pro series is very heavy (about 30-45 lbs). The desk lasted about 1.5 hours before cracking and i had to take it off before losing a chunk of the desk along with my new tablet. This was caused due to the pressure of the arm being focused on the side of the main bracket, as opposed to the front of it. The pressure was too much and it sunk into the ""wood"" top.  I knew what the risk was by doing this and expected this to happen, so i want suprised, but wanted to let buyers know to reinforce or rethink their positioning.This can probably be fixed by making sure you have a heavy duty top, additional under support, and/or an additional leg installed near the arm.Luckily this was a garbage desk i got from a friend so i wasted no money in the test.Arm is great though! Works better than i thought it would honestly :) very useful",1

It took about 20 minutes to install. The only tool required was a small screwdriver to remove the mount from my monitor (It's a Dell 2407WFP, by the way).My desk has a glass top surface (on top of wood), so I was worried about the stand scratching the glass, cracking the glass, or not getting a good fit against the glass. Luckily, the base has rubber pads so that it grips the glass very well without scratching it.The build quality is excellent. The parts are weighty and feel solid. The monitor moves around very well and has quite a large range of motion on this arm. One odd aspect of the installation is that the 2 articulated arms are not bolted together in anyway -- each one sits on top of a plastic flange and is held in place just by the weight of the monitor. This sounds like a shaky set up but it works out nicely in practice, although there is a little bit of play around each flange (given that they are not manufactured perfectly).The one drawback is the cable management system. The lower arm (which is optional) has a removable cover and is hollow so that you can route wires through it. However, neither the base nor the upper arm has any built in cable management. Seems weird (to me) to have the capability only in one part (and the optional part, at that) and not have it in the two required parts. Even weirder, they include 2 cable ties in the box so that you can cable tie your wires to the upper arm to hold them in place. This was the option I chose, and it works fine, so my rating is still 5 stars, even though it is an odd design.I was able to get a couple square feet of usable desk space by using this arm instead of the standard monitor base, plus I can now swing the monitor around to watch movies from my bed (it's a weird angle -- the room is L-shaped), and to top it all off, I got overnight delivery for free :) Highly recommended.UPDATE:After using this for several years, I still love it. In fact, I just ordered a second one to go to a dual-display set up.When I moved a couple years ago, I lost the plastic flange that fits inside this arm. I emailed Ergotron to tell them about this, and they mailed me a new flange for free. They didn't even charge me for shipping. That level of customer service is so rare!!! I'd give 6 stars if I could.",2

I love the look of the matte black and how much more desk space they have given me and how easy they are to put together. They clip to the back of the desk in the form of a mount and are easy to adjust to where ever you might need them to be placed. The bases are large and study but smaller than the monitor stand base which is great for saving room. They are adjustable up and down along with swiveling in and out. I've had these for a couple years now and have no intention of changing them out. Sure they are worth a pretty penny but if you have a heavier monitor it is worth it to have piece of mind that they will not drop your monitor.I would be careful about making the tightness too much on the mounts though as if you do, it will mark the pole with a silver circle from the Allen Wrench spot. It might not matter to most as that would normally be on the back but I rotated my adjustment hole to the front due to owning a L-shaped desk. It was easier for me this way then needing to pull the desk away from the wall each time I wanted to change something about my set up.",2

I always had a hard time getting the included stand to rotate the screen properly, and since I use a dual screen set-up, it was an absolute pain to comfortably position the keyboard/mouse for other functions on my cluttered desk. This ergonomic desk mount has solved all my problems.I wasn't totally sold that this mount could actually hold something as heavy as a Cintiq, but sure enough it can. I can float it around my desk and it seems to stay in place no matter how I position it. You do have to tighten all of the joints quite a bit before it will hold, but within 10 minutes of assembly I was happy with the tightness.Assembly is very easy, though I would recommend asking a friend to help you when you put the monitor on to ensure you don't drop your screen. There are 3 main parts that just pop together and it includes all necessary screws and a few tools to help adjust things. However, you'll need a Phillips screw driver to finish mounting your screen.I like that it clamps onto the desk, so you don't have to destroy a desk to use it. I also like that it has a huge range of rotation in pretty much every direction. You can spin your screen 360 degrees in either direction and move it left and right as far as your screen's cable will let you. It does move up and down, but you have a limited range of heights to choose from. You can still get it pretty far in either direction though so it's not too much of an issue. At its lowest setting, you can easily get a screen into your lap (my favorite feature for the Cintiq), and at its highest you can probably get 6 or 7 inches of clearance off the desk. You can choose to lock the arm into a certain position or leave it flexible. Even when flexible it holds its position unless you force it to move, so you don't have to worry about it dropping your screen.If you're a Cintiq 21UX user, definitely get this arm. It's amazing how flexible my Cintiq has become with it. I always hated the stand it came with since it forced you to strategically place the unit. With this arm you can just move it around with ease and set your desk up however you want. You can also finally sit back in your chair and draw!This arm will fit pretty much any screen under 20lbs, but I'd only recommend buying this if you intend to move your screen around a lot.",2

This is fantastic, but whether I was standing or sitting, I always came back to the same problem - my monitor height from the base of my desk was too low. What started out as a search for just a monitor stand eventually turned into a search for monitor arms because, let's face it, having options is never a bad thing. So, I spent a lot of time looking at various monitor arms in the $30-$60 range. Over a long week, I patiently read all reviews, noted the different arm combinations/dimensions, and paid particular attention to the cons of each product. Although it hurt my eyes the first time I saw the price tag on this beauty, I eventually realized it was the closest thing I would find to meet my functional expectations, and settling for anything else would probably bring more frustration than satisfaction in the long term. Ever bought something cheaper in order to save money, but ended up getting rid of it and buying the more expensive item anyway? Yeah, that sucks because you end up paying even more than the original cost. So... I stopped procrastinating and decided I would give it a shot, besides, we're talking about Amazon - I could always return it if I didn't like it. :)Here are some bullet points taken from my overall experience:-setup out of the box was easy-the mount/arm are very well built-my desk is less than one inch, but the mount fit like a glove and the unit is very firm!My overall productivity at my work desk has increased greatly. Now that I'm able to move into whatever position is comfortable, and manipulate my monitor position with ease, I am not sure how I ever lived without it. I am also very happy that I didn't ""cheap out"" and buy some of the other monitor arms that I was looking at previously. Speaking of which, one of them was a monitor arm attached to a 31 inch pole. Imagine that... a 31 inch pole protruding from the base of your desk like a giant antenna. No way! The Ergotron arm is very stylish, highly functional, exceptionally well built, and very easy to adjust. It has exceeded my initial expectations. It is a dream. I keep thinking it's going to disappear because it's too good to be true. Although it's not always the case, sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I'm very happy for making this purchase... very satisfied with the results.",2

Once I understood though, it was all very simple.The arm mount had surprising weight to it out of the box. I mean I guess it has to be strong if its holding up a screen I just wasn't expecting it. Not a con, just, surprised.My real mistake was not putting the mounted screen on first and attaching it to the corresponding piece on the arm mount. (pretty sure this is step one in the visual instructions). The reason I overlooked this was I initally fearful the piece and screen would slip from my hands and fall onto my glass desk as I tried to set up the mount in the right position. They also gave no written reasoning for why this was the first step so I thought it was just one of those steps I could skip and come back to..Apparently not.So, I tried to assemble the mount by itself, leaving the screen until last in my excitment and just before i screwed the screen on I realised it wasn't rotating as I was told it would. It was rather stiff and I tried unscrew all possible points where the mount might be loosened, but to no avail. Going over the instructions throroughly, I was more n more frustrated and sorely lost. I'm no engineer or product designer so in laymans terms: the screens weight is used by the air pump inside the arm mount to help it move around as it should. without the screen attached, it wont budge, even if you put all your weight on it. Least in my case anyways.  So if i'd followed the instructions unclear as they seemed, it would have been more simple to put together.The performance of the mount is brilliant. It doesn't move from it spot aside from a slight upward pull due to the air pump, but its minimal and not enough to interfere with your line of sight. The only issue I had as a digital artist with my tablet attached to this, was when rotating the screen various degrees, I often forgot about my cords that ran through the kindly given managment slots and combined with the constant rotating this way and that, I bent important cords slightly because of the pull. Will have to be more careful in the future.Overall great product even if I personally found the instructions difficult.",1

Both arms are Innovative brand 7000 series, considered industry quality high use business arms. I will compare the two below.Stability:In comparison, the Ergotron arm is a little more jiggly, but not enough to affect your computing work. The Innovative is solid.Mounting:Both can mount through desk, and when mounted in this way both are equally strong. The Ergotron out performs the Innovative 10-1 when clamped to the side of a desk, having a large and solid base and knob that can be hand tightened. The clamp comes completely assembled. The Ergotron arm also allows for differing desk thicknesses for mounting, while the Innovative does not--but is plenty deep for anything I can imagine to which you might want to mount it. Between the two, the Ergotron is the easiest to mount, and for side desk mounting, the most solid.The Innovative arm requires you to build the clamp and use an Allen wrench to tighten it to the desk. The clamping piece is thick enough, but not wide enough, and it doesn't give you the ability to mount the clamping mechanism deeper when space allows. I had one of my monitors fall off once because the side mount clamp worked loose.Fluidity:Both arms are satisfactory, but the Ergotron arm is quite a bit easier to move and more fluid. The Innovative is a little stiff for my taste. (Update: October 22, 2010. I finally had had it with the Innovative rotation plate sticking. I took it apart and put a wedge between the pin and backing and hit it with a hammer, lightly, in order to loosen it a little. The cast steel pin just popped off. It's just too tight, and not adjustable, from the factory. Monitor rotation is extremely sticky and annoying to adjust. Depending on the replacement part price, I may just trash that arm and buy another Ergotron.)Price:No comparison. You can buy almost three Ergotron arms for the price of one Innovative arm, of which then 7000 series go for around 310.00USD each.I really have no problems with either product's quality, but the side mount engineering of the Innovative arm is a nader compared to the quality of the arm itself, and so too for the rotation difficulties. If I had to buy all three arms again, I'd go with Ergotron, mainly for the price but also for the superior desk clamp and movement fluidity. However, I've had the Innovative arms for over two years with no mechanical problems, and the Ergotron only a month.",1

As others have said in their reviews, the photos do not really show the solid quality of this monitor arm; this LX arm is top quality steel.  That's right, not plastic, not aluminum, but steel.  The only plastic part is a decorative panel that hides the cables along the bottom of the arm.  Anything that is weight baring is made of heavy gauge steel.  Also, as some else said in their review the Ergotron arm looks like someone shipped you the arm of some futuristic robot.I bought this LX desk mount to hold a LG 34"" UltraWide monitor (the 34UM95-P).  Ergotron recommends the MX desk mount for large and heavy monitors, but I have had this for over 2 months now and everything is great.  Even though the LG 34UM95 is a 34"" monitor it only weighs 14.9 pounds (6.75 kg) without its stand, and the LX desk mount can hold up to 25 pounds (11.3 kg).I was concerned before I bought the LX arm that the LG, being an UltraWide monitor, would wobble from movement on my desk.  Once the LG monitor was mounted and the tension in the LX arm was properly adjusted the monitor is as steady as a rock with no wobble.  I can work and write on my desk and the monitor never moves from whatever position I have it in.Being able to have my monitor mounted on this arm has helped a lot.  My desk is now clear to host whatever I want to do, such as a graphics tablet; various books open to reference; or a midi keyboard.  My last computer was an iMac, and even though it is a great computer it dominated my desktop.  I wish I would have known then to get an Ergotron arm (specifically if you have an iMac get the Ergotron DX arm, since it can hold the weight of the iMac).  Now that I have seen the quality and superior function of a monitor mounted to an Ergotron arm I will never not have one.I am already making plans to get a second LX arm to hold my laptop,  a third arm to hold a Wacom tablet, and the keyboard try arm that mounts under the desk.  I am going to have so many arms that people are going to mistake me for Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock) from Spiderman.",2

I've only had them a couple of months, so time will tell with regard to durability.The look of the white is really classy and works well with my office.  I ordered the silver/black ones before I saw these available...The silver and black ones are great for some peoples' set ups, I'm sure, but for my office, there's a lot of gray and white, and this looks perfect.Overall, very pleased.

I purchased this arm along with the laptop tray also sold by Ergotron for my Cintiq 13HD. Needless to say this review will be most helpful for artists with a digital drawing tablet who seek to mount it on an arm.I heard this arm in particular was a favorite among Wacom tablet users, so decided to go for the plunge. Wacom Cintiq13HDs do not have a port on the back for mounting however, so I had to consider a laptop tray as well. I ordered the arm and tray with Prime. It shipped and arrived on my doorstep in two days. It came almost entirely assembled, separated into the three different arm parts. After ogling the directions and trying to figure out how to adjust the tension on the different parts, I now have it fully assembled and attached to a sturdy table nearby my desk. The idea of the arm was to free up valuable desk space and help make my freelance art business a little more efficient, since I had to put my tablet away every time I wanted to use the computer without having the tablet in my way on the desk.So far I am very happy with the purchase. Both the arm and the tray work beautifully together. The lowest tension for the up and down tilt of the tray happened to be just right; I can adjust it on the fly if needed, but the pressure I put on my tablet when drawing does not push it back down as well. Another perk for artists using this is the fact that your tablet is no longer resting on the desk and is propped up at an angle, which means you can practice drawing with your whole arm rather than just your wrist, ultimately keeping carpal tunnel at bay.The arm itself is incredibly sturdy and very well made, with a nice professional looking finish. It wobbles a little around the rod on the clamp that holds it to the table, but I'm sure that can be fixed with a little adjusting. It honestly doesn't bother me enough to consider tweaking it though.All in all I would highly recommend this arm to anybody with a graphic tablet in need of desk space, or are seeking a more comfortable graphic design experience.",2

Everyone talks about how high these monitors arms can be adjusted, but I am short and was interested in lowering the monitor to avoid looking up and resulting neck pain.  I was looking for a stand that would allow me to place the monitor very close to the desk with about 1/4 on an inch clearance.  I also wanted to be able to move the monitor close to me when I am using it, and out of the way when  I am not using it.This Ergotron LX arm performs these tasks well because it has more joints than some of the other arms on the market and extra joints provide more flexibility. The arm is very sturdy, and handle the weight of my 24"" wide screen monitor well. It stays securely in place, yet remains easy to reposition.INSTALLATIONI ran into a couple of glitches during the installation1) The join that attaches to the monitor was extremely stiff. In the instructions and YouTube videos it is shown perpendicular to the monitor.  When it arrived it was aligned flat for packing and I could not budge it no matter how hard I tried. I had to get a man with muscles to force into the right position.  It took him quite a while, as he was afraid to break it by forcing it too hard, but eventually he gave it all he had and it moved.2) The installation instructions claim that desk clamp can be attached to desks from with thickness from .4"" to 2.4"". My desk is 1 3/4"" thick and I could not open the clamp wide enough to put it on. Luckily I have a thin leaf (6/8"") that comes out of the desk and the clamp attached to that just fine.I am very pleased with Ergotron LX arm and my new set up. I am attaching the photo that demonstrates the mounting of the new 24"" monitor along with the old 19"" inch monitor for dual monitor set up.Ali Julia review",1

Fit and finish are excellent and adjustments are smooth and easy. It's well designed and looks professional and classy, with real metal accents that appear to be brushed stainless steel. The materials used are top notch. All of the structural components are made of steel. These days, it's great to find a product that doesn't use plastic just to cut costs, even on stress-bearing parts that should  be made of metal. The only plastic parts I spotted are the end cap of the vertical base tube and cable management fitting. The manufacturer clearly cared more about quality than cutting corners. Mine had some light scratches on the brushed stainless steel parts, which aren't noticeable unless looking closely. I don't know if it was a return or if they're all like that.What I like best about this mount is the wide range of adjustment it allows. I have it mounted on the rear edge of my desk and can bring the monitor forward enough so that I can kick back in my chair with feet on the desk and still have it at a comfortable viewing distance. The height is adjustable enough so that I can rotate my 27"" widescreen to portrait mode, not that I plan to do so on a regular basis. Any monitor larger than 27"" would not work in portrait mode with this mount due to insufficient clearance at maximum height. The mounting hardware permits it to be mounted on desks of varying thicknesses and there's also a fitting to allow mounting using a small hole in the desktop.Pretty much all of the benefits mentioned in the product description are accurate and not exaggerated. This mount has helped reduce neck and shoulder pain, eye strain and probably back pain, since I no longer have to adjust my posture to suit the monitor's position or struggle to read on a screen that's too far back. I also bought the
332B Notebook/Laptop Extension Stand Desktop Clamp
for my laptop, together with the Ergotron. With these mounts, I've reclaimed quite a bit of desktop space, making it easier to stay organized.This mount is a good value and well worth the price. It's built to last and will improve workspace comfort for many years to come. Highly recommended.",2

The install went smooth with relatively easy to follow instructions (though the drawings were laid out in a pretty odd order) and sits nicely on my desk.Personally I used it for my Cintiq (which I don't have set up fully since I need to order a DVI-I extension cable, since on my last order I was sent the wrong cable) and it works perfectly, BUT... it feels like the Cintiq, despite still having a couple lbs of weight before being at the Ergotron's max supported weight, is really pushing the Ergotron to it's limits.The way I have my desk set up, an ideal situation would be two Ergotron LX desk mounts with an additional Extension arm for each to make them reach further attached to my 2 monitors, but unfortunately I don't trust it to support the weight of my Cintiq with an additional arm (the further away from the base, the more stress that will be placed on it).My only other concern would be that no felt was included, so with a heavy monitor attached to a desk can easily scar the desk, I'll be picking some up and attaching to it myself so my desk doesn't get ruined should I decide to remove the arm at a later date.I guess I write this review for two reasons:1) Ergotron LX is an excellent adjustable arm and I would recommend it to anyone with a Cintiq that has thought about the investment in the past.2) I also write this as a note to Ergotron developers: there is a definite market need for us Wacom Cintiq Users.  If Ergotron made the arm support a few more lbs (30 would be ideal) while having the reach of the LX + an additional extension arm, you'd have one HELL of a product for artists and drafters that use the Cintiq line of pen tablets.  So, Ergotron, if you ever come out with a product like that, marked somewhere in the 200-400 dollar range, I'd be interested in buying one (or two).  The distance is very important, because ideally, we'd bring it to our chairs so we can reduce stress on our backs while working (leaning forward or even sitting straight up and reaching arms out to the desk is incredibly painful after years of work).",1

I went back and forth on which model to get, either this or the one intended for heavier screens but once I got this set up it has been perfect.At first the arm didn’t seem strong enough to hold my monitor up, but a quick search showed me a specific bolt to tighten for increasing the vertical resistance and I quickly had it dialed in.The cable routing is nice and the clamp holds very securely on my desk (husky adjustable workbench wood top).  There is some wobble if you wiggle the desk too much (common for arms I think) but it’s really not bad and settles down quickly.My only gripe is that even after inserting the rotation locking screw there is still a fair amount of play left to right rotationally that has me spending a few seconds re-leveling my screen after any move.  Pretty minor issue though.Overall, this is a great monitor arm that should last a long time and has already allowed me to reclaim the dead space my old stand took up on my desk.  Highly recommend.",2

This monitor arm has a maximum down-tilt of 5 degrees, and I promise you, you are not going to be happy with the extremely limited down-tilt.  For my use case, I needed to mount a monitor to view CCTV footage that is somewhat higher up on the wall than the rest of my regular work/task monitors.  This particular arm is not suited for that.  I contacted Ergotron customer service, who were amazing by the way, and they quickly advised that there was no getting around the down-tilt restrictions on this unit.  They asked if I was within the return window with Amazon, which I was (by one day).  They advised that the best solution would be to return the product to Amazon and re-purchase the Ergotron MVX which has basically unlimited down-tilt.  I just received the MVX today, installed it, and they were absolutely correct.  The MVX was EXACTLY what I needed.  So, no fault can be given to Ergotron, the products are what they are - but I wanted to leave this review to hopefully save someone else the hassle of getting the wrong product for their needs and having to go through the whole return/re-purchase drama like I just did.  Ergotron customer service was A+ and the build quality on these (both of these) are excellent.  If you are planning on using the LX at eye level, it will probably work great for you.  But for the same price, I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to go with the MVX and have the ability to tilt in every direction as much as you might possibly want or need to.  YMMV, of course.",1

I did not use a drill, and I am not that strong. One bolts went in fine. The other was almost flush when it snapped. There are no spares, my office is a mess, and The project won’t get done this weekend unless I go to a hardware store and buy my own bolts (and of course ill have to remeasure because one hole has a chunk of bolt in it).

I received in earlier than expected but when me and my son tried to install it the mount would not let budge--the instructions said we had to give it several tries so we did that. Everything worked fine except we could not swivel the monitor at all--it would not budge. We used every allen wrench--we suspect there was a tool missing, but by that time we were so frustrated with the directions--which were all visual and not very helpful. It truly must be easier than this, but they wanted 100 dollars for me to get someone out here to install. I think I'll go with a knock off version--cheaper and I get to keep my sanity...",-2

There are few wall-mount swing arms that offer the versatility of the Ergotron Lx.  And there are even fewer that compete at this price, which is substantial but worth it in my opinion.Right out of the box, you can tell that this is a quality product.  From the heavy 80mm hardened steel mounting bolts, to the mounting wall anchor with plastic vanity covers for the bolts, to the precision movement in the arm itself, there is no doubt that you are getting what you pay for.  The Ergotron Lx both looks nice and feels nice.  I am very happy with my purchase, which was hard to do.  After all, it's ~$120 just to mount a monitor on a wall.  But when you consider the quality of the product with the ergonomic configurations it offers, it's totally worth the cost.  And let's be honest, ergonomics are expensive in general, so this is really not such a terrible price.The product installed relatively smoothly.  I did not have a drill bit that could completely bore an 80mm hole to accommodate the massive bolts, but after some ratcheting it all worked out.  After that, attaching the VESA mount to the Monitor was a cinch with included thumb screws or, if you don't like thumb screws, Phillips-head screws.  But who doesn't like thumb screws?  Then it was just a matter of sliding the arms on top of their respective mounts.  Adjustments for each of the joints could be easily done with an Allen wrench (provided, if you don't have one).Adjusting the Lx was simple enough.  You can tighten the spring-arm so that it can support your monitor weight or you can make the joints stiffer or looser per your preference.  I found that the joint to swivel the monitor right and left was a bit stiff even at its loosest, but I don't take issue.  The adjustment to tighten the spring-arm is hidden so you'll need to read the manual to find that one.The manual was quite detailed in many respects, but could probably benefit from some proof-reading.  There are no explanations -- only diagrams.  And not all of the items pictured in the diagrams are accurate.  Minor stuff though.  They'll have a picture of a Phillips-head screw, but be using a hex Allen wrench in the diagram.  The manual is also laid out weird so that it's not completely obvious which diagram is relevant.  But the product is fairly simple to install so the shoddy manual is forgivable.  I found that the suggestion for a 3/16 drill bit to bore the hole for the 80mm bolts was insufficient.  I went a little larger myself.Among that which has already been described, the unit also includes a plastic cover underneath the rear ""bone"" of the arm to manage cables to your monitor.  It clips in nicely to neatly hold strong a decent amount of cable.  The arm itself has a very impressive range of motion.  When you move it up and down, it moves the VESA mount synchronously to maintain the configured angle of the monitor.The reason I purchased this was because my monitor was too far across my desk and I had to lean over to see causing some major issues with my mouse arm being bent and all.  Now I have both newly freed desk space as well as much less pain in my mouse arm.  Plus I can see the monitor a lot better.  I could have purchased a $40 swing arm to get the job done,  but the versatility in being able to raise and lower the monitor on-demand is quite worth it.  I highly recommend this product.Positives:- Quality Design- Versatility- Ease of use and installation- Ergonomically pleasing- Aesthetic detailNegatives:- Instruction manual needs work- Only supports up to 20 lbs or 22"" monitors",2

I've installed countless ""el cheapo"" LCD wall mounts & none of them had self leveling arms or swivel for that matter. None of them were built like this thing is, cast aluminum arms and aluminum wall bracket. You will probably want to loosen the leveling spring with the enclosed Allen wrench before you try to figure out where you want to mount it.  It will outlive you if you install it and use it within its listed application. If there is one gripe to be had it would be that the joints are riveted together which would be no issue unless they loosen up over time. I haven't had it that long to determine that would happen. It has built-in cable routing channels and a black cover that clips over the underside of the arm. There are covers for the bracket as well as the open ends of the arm sections to give the clean look by covering up the lag heads.I'm impressed. I've been in the IT business for 20 years and I've never seen such a well made LCD arm. I installed this in my house, in my computer room, to liberate me from the decades of being behind a desk and fighting to find comfortable computer chairs. Seems like computer chairs get more expensive though built with less quality, cheaper materials, and even smaller dimensions. My last straw was investing 300 in a chair and obviously being less than happy with it I decided to go this route.I purchased the keyboard tray and arm from Ergotron as well. I have a Logitech G15 keyboard and it sits on the board but overlaps both sides by about 1-1/2"". Not enough to restrict mouse use on the slide pad. I can't quite get it situated where its comfortable just yet. It doesn't have a forward tilt. I have a feeling it will have to go to my local machine shop for some modifications. It tilts up for storage but doesn't tilt any farther down than 90 degrees. That's not good enough typing from a recliner. If it only had 10-15 degrees of forward tilt it'd be perfect too. If its arm joints weren't riveted a modification like this would not be hard. As it is I suspect we'll end up drilling the rivets to separate the joint behind the keyboard and knock off enough material where it hits in the down position to drop it a little more. This modification would definitely void your warranty but it would make the keyboard tray a lot more comfortable for folks that play from a recliner.All in all both products from Ergotron are top notch and worth the price. It's priceless to me, no more back pain from the hunched over the computer desk position. I almost feel a little guilty now for the other folks that are still gaming at their desks and I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. =)Update: After having used the keyboard tray for a week or so there are adhesive backed gliding strips under the mouse tray. One of the strips peeled up and got caught inside the keyboard tray, restricting its movement. I was just able to remove that strip from inside the keyboard tray. I would have thought that for 200 dollars nearly the glides would have been of better, longer lasting quality.",1

Great extension, one of the furthest I’ve seen on Amazon. Perfect for a deep desk like mine.2. Easy assembly if you’ve done this sort of thing before.3. Very easy to adjust my monitor on the bracket.4. Build quality of the mount feels solid.Cons1. Included lag screws are junk. They didn’t fit my 1/2 inch nut driver by a centimeter, which felt like poor machining. Other reviews mention shearing after install. Do yourself a favor and pick up a different set. I used a 5/16 4” lag screw set without issue.2. Instructions are very bad, but this isn’t too much of a con since there are only 3 pieces to assemble. Be sure to get your mounting height exactly what the instructions specified! This was the only useful information in the packet.3. High cost for what you’re getting, but a necessity if you need a more considerable mount for a deeper extension.",1

It is very easy and simple to install, just make sure you get the two bolts secured into the wood stud in the wall and not just through drywall, drilling a pilot hole for the bolts first help. After getting the bolts and plate secured to the wall, it's only a simple task of stacking the arms on top of each other to get the desired length.  I had purchased an extra arm extension to that I could extend my monitor further away.  The last step is to just take off the mount on your monitor and attach it to the wall mount.My computer desk is only a few feet away from my bed, so sometimes it is very convenient to just move the monitor and have it faced towards my bed so that I can watch movies on my computer right from my bed, and wireless peripherals make it that much better! Since installing this wall mount, I have not had any worries or problems with it, even with the extension arm, it feels very safe and sturdy.  This wall mount is a real space saver, my HP monitor had this gigantic and cumbersome mount that took a lot of space on my desk, now with my monitor floating over my desk, it is a lot more cleaner looking and there is a heck of a lot more room to place whatever other junk I may have on my desk.  If you have a cluttered desk, having your monitor float will make it look a whole lot cleaner or at least the illusion of it.  Just one caveat that you may need to be aware of, is that because the wall mount can hide the power and HDMI/VGA cables, and any additional wires you may have such as sound or for the usb hub on your monitor, inside its arms, it will shorten the amount of cable length you can work with.  For that I would suggest buying longer cables, since your computer and outlet may not be right under where you installed the wall mount.  Other than that, this is a great and high quality product, sure to impress anyone!",2

Schimmelman,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2014","I bought this to replace an arm that I had been using for over 15 years and finally gave it up.  It only died because of a manufacturing defect that took that long to break.  This arm is a similar design, but much more sleek and stylish.  It has more vertical and extension distances and the friction settings were perfect right out of the box.  It looks good and is heavy duty, using aluminum alloy parts.  Now for the modification part.My screen is above me when I'm in my easy chair, so it needs to tip down.  Several other reviewers have complained that it only tips down a slight amount, and it's true.  It's right there in the spec.  For some unknown reason they bent a couple small tabs from the steel part of the pivot so they hit against the aluminum casting to limit the tip.  It would be easy to grind the tabs off or grind the aluminum down with a dremel tool, but that would scatter metal dust and grinding powder all over and make a mess.Instead, I took a small pair of vise grips and took a deep grip on the tab, but not real tight, and used a bit of squeezing and bending to straighten it up about 2/3 of the way.  Then I took a tighter grip with the end of the tool right at the bend point and straightened it almost all the way.  Finally I took another deep grip that was tight to smooth out the metal at the bend.  Do that for both sides and in about 10 minutes your screen will pivot down, and there's no mess and nothing to paint.They could have eliminated a manufacturing step and produced a better project.  What were they thinking?I haven't noticed any side effects.  It holds the wires better than my other arm, and was 1/3 the price.",1

The first set of arms I purchased, 2 monitor arms and 2 keyboard arms, have been holding up very well, look great, and work great.I needed to purchase another monitor arm because I added another system to my office setup, and was a little surprised that Ergotron changed the finish - it is now a stainless steel 'like' finish, shiny and polished. This is a step up from a quality appearance from the last version of their product, which is more of an aluminum matte type of finish. I do like them both, and although they mismatch in appearance, I like the appearance of this arm better. *if you are adding to your existing Ergotron arms that have the matte finish, and appearance is an issue for you, you may want to consider this and possibly buy an entire new set - if you have the funds...Ergotron updated the cable management system - it is no longer the ""snap-in"" system, it is a solid cover now that clips into the arm. It slides and clips. It's a little tricky the first couple times you try it - after you understand how it is put together, it is pretty easy to add/remove cables.Installation is easy, given you have the proper tools - namely, you need a DEEP-WELL SOCKET with a ratchet to bolt this thing onto your wall. Do NOT ATTEMPT without the proper tools, otherwise you will strip the head and get frustrated and leave bad comments like I've seen others do.Black snap-on bolt head covers, along with the sleek new polished steel look of the arm, makes this a beautiful system. The tilt work a bit differently from previous version - more of a slide system moving up and down the rail - but I don't find it better or worse than the previous version arm.I love the system. I don't think you can find a better consumer rated system out there. High quality, functional, looks great.",2

I want to say I spent less than 30 minutes from the time I started to the time it was up and running.  I have set up other mounting arms that attached to the desk or were free standing.  With those devices I found that getting the monitor attached to the mounting plate is always difficult.  Attaching other devices to the edge of a desk can also be cumbersome.The design of this arm is very simple.  The plate that attaches to the wall does not have the swivel arm permanently attached.  That makes it very small and light.  I located the wall stud and drilled the two 5/16"" holes needed in just a few minutes.  The mounting bolts are three inches long, so you need to have a long drill bit.  I used a 1/4"" drive ratchet with a 1/2"" socket to install the two bolts.  The bolts are listed as 13mm but the 1/2"" socket did work.  However, it was ""snug"" fit for the socket.If you don't have a socket set, you may have trouble getting the bolts completely tight.  There is a ""U"" shaped area where the bolts fit.  You would not be able to get a crescent wrench or a pair of pliers in there easily.Once the plate was mounted to the wall, the first arm just drops into place on the spindle in seconds.Mounting the second arm to the monitor was also very simple.  Four thumb screws are provided.  It was very simple for me to lay the monitor on its face and line up the mounting holes.  The plate has holes for 100mm and 75mm.The provided thumb screws were the correct size to fit into my monitor.  Because you are only holding one of the arms while you attach it to the monitor, it is a one person job.  The arm is light enough to be held with one hand while you line up the holes.  Your free hand can then start the thumb screws into holes.  You are not trying to juggle the arm, a screw and a screwdriver at the same time.Once the arm was mounted to the monitor, it drops into place on the spindle at the end of the first arm.  At this point, you have a usable system.  By grasping the sides of the monitor, you can move it around or rotate it.The remaining steps are mostly cosmetic.  There are two plastic covers that snap over the top and bottom of the wall mounting plate to cover the bolts.  There is also a plastic cover to snap over the spindle at the ""elbow"" of the two arms.  That took less than two minutes to put those on.  You might want to watch the YouTube video on this arm.  It shows the assemble steps.Dressing the cable by attaching them to the arms was a little awkward.  Two black zip ties are provided in the package.  They are used to attache the wires to the mounting arm attached to the monitor.  There are two protrusions on the bottom of the arm that the zip ties go over.  You have to do this pretty much by feel when the monitor sits over a desk.The arm attached to the wall has a removable plastic cover that will expose the channel for the cables.  I have three cables to my monitor (HDMI, VGA and power).  Getting them lined up inside the cover and getting it reattached to the arm was also a little awkward.  The cables were a little stiff and kept wanting to jump out of the channel.  I was leaning over the desk and the top of the monitor trying to do this.Like some of the other reviews, my only downside on this mounting arm is the instructions.  The instructions consist of one sheet of paper approximately 11"" by 17"" printed on both sides.  They show five steps but is it not the logical order in which you need to proceed.Step 1 is a chart that shows how high off the floor the wall bracket needs to be.  There are four columns and six rows of entries.  Two columns are for 4x3 monitors and two columns are for 16x9 monitors.  For each monitor aspect ratio, there is a column for sitting and one for standing.  The six rows in the table are for various monitor sizes ranging from 15"" to 22"".The first time I looked at the chart, I found it confusing. I then realized the variations in the measurements was approximately 2"" for a seated user.  For example, the wall plate should be mounted 34.9"" off the floor for a 15"" 16x9 monitor.  A 22"" 16x9 monitor should be 33.2"" off the floor.  Since the mounting arm will move up and down approximately 6.5"", it didn't really matter how precise you mounted the bracket to the wall.I put the bottom of my wall mounting plate 4.5"" above the top of my desk.  The bottom of the 22"" monitor will come down to approximately 5"" from the top of my desk.Step 2 of the instructions was an ""exploded"" view of all of the mounting arm parts.  I don't understand why this is step 2.Step 3 is the wall plate mounting options. In addition to the bolts, plastic anchors are also provided if you want to install this into a concrete wall.  The instructions show an optional wall track and bracket that can be purchased separately.  That might be nice if you want to adjust the monitor between a sitting and a standing position.Step 4 shows how to adjust the tension.  There is a step 4a and 4b for the two different adjustments.  Step 4 covers about 80% of one side of the instructions.  Most of that is four different warnings in nine languages.Step 5 shows a set screw on both spindles that can be tightened.  I suspect that tightening these two screws would lock the arm in position.  A 2.5mm wrench is provided to do this.  If the first arm is perpendicular to the wall, you would probably not be able to get the wrench into the set screw.I do like this mounting arm.  I am considering getting a second one for other monitors on my desk.",1

Funciona perfecto para lo que es y tiene infinidad de movimientos y posiciones.Por todo lo anterior lo veo muy recomendable y no se si los habra mejores.La parte mala, es que el soporte a la pared viene con 2 tornillos de 8 cm que atraviesan cualquier pared normal de una vivienda. No solo eso, al estar sujeto solo en dos puntos y ser el punto de apoyo relativamente estrecho para la palanca que hace el brazo estirado, no lo veo como buen soporte y creo que acabaria machacando la pared (en caso de muchos movimientos diarios).Para que la instalacion sea perfecta tienes que comprar una de las siguientes dos opciones que se instalan con 4 o 6 tornillos de 5 cm (mi pared queda perfecto, pero no lo instalaria en pladur convencional):Ergotron wall mount plate  Part Number: 97-101-003 Dimensions: 3.5"" x 8.38"" (90 x 213 mm) Recommended for use with LX Arms when attaching to wall with steel studs.Esto sube el precio mas o menos unos 40€La otra opcion que es aun mas cara porque son dos piezas por separado, es por la que me decante:Wall Track  Part Number: 31-016-182 Cuesta unos 40 eurosDescription: 10"" Wall Track (aluminum) with cable management channel coverTrack Mount Bracket kit  Part Number: 97-091  Description: Track Mount Bracket Kit (aluminum) Cuesta otros 40€.Use with LX and MX Arms, 400, 200 and 100 Series products, Universal CPU Holder (80-105-064) or Utility Shelf (97-507-216)Por esta ultima parte es por lo que no le doy 5 estrellas al producto, que en si es muy bueno, pero deberia de venir con una base mejor para el anclaje o venir con estas otras partes incluidas con el brazo extensible.",1

Dafür gibt es 2 Sterne Abzug. Das erste Gelenk hinter dem Monitor zur Drehung nach rechts und links war so fest, dass ich den Ergotron LX Arm für Wandmontage schon zurück senden wollte. Es hätte mir glatt die Rückwand vom Monitor (BenQ 27"") abgerissen. Nach endlosen Versuchen mit dem Hersteller Kontakt aufzunehmen, war dann endlich eine deutschsprachige Hotline erreichbar. Ja, ganz einfach war das Problem zu lösen. Da für dieses Gelenk keine Verstellung durch Schrauben möglich ist, hilft einfach ölen. Ich habe Schlossfit von Sonax (gibt es bei Autozubehör) verwendet und endlich ließ sich das Gelenk leicht verstellen.Auf der Montageanleitung werden nur Montagehinweise für Monitore bis 22 "" angegeben. Ich habe den 27"" Monitor in 80 cm Höhe ab Boden angebracht; passt perfekt für den Schreibtisch. Die 80 mm langen Montageschrauben sind ein Witz für Neubauwände. Wer diese verwendet, kann an der Rückseite gleich einen Kleiderbügel anhängen. Ich habe 50 mm Schrauben gleicher Stärke verwendet und alles ist bombenfest. Die Wandstärke im Plattenbau war übrigens genau 50 mm, also Vorsicht beim Bohren.Was hier ebenfalls fehlt, da Monitore immer größer aber auch immer leichter werden, das Mindestgewicht laut Hersteller für ein Gerät (ohne Fuß!) beträgt 3,2 kg!!!Die Verlegung der Kabel in den Kabelkanälen mit Setzung der Abdeckung ist aufgrund des geringen Platzes nach einiger Übung und nur zu zweit möglich.Nachdem dieses alles übertanden ist, bin ich mit der montierten Halterung zufrieden. aufgrund des geringen Monitorgewichts sind alle Schrauben zur Arretierung der Gelenke nicht sehr fest angezogen. Es hängt nichts schief und es wackelt nichts.",0

They didn’t fit my 1/2 inch nut driver by a centimeter, which felt like poor machining. Other reviews mention shearing after install. Do yourself a favor and pick up a different set. I used a 5/16 4” lag screw set without issue.2. Instructions are very bad, but this isn’t too much of a con since there are only 3 pieces to assemble. Be sure to get your mounting height exactly what the instructions specified! This was the only useful information in the packet.3. High cost for what you’re getting, but a necessity if you need a more considerable mount for a deeper extension.",1

That being said, there are a few minor annoyances that hold it back from being truly great.First off, the arm has cable management channels, but it requires you to use zip-ties in the upper half of the arm; the mounting holes aren’t large enough to fit even a small Velcro tie through. The lower half of the arm uses a plastic sheath, but I wish that the plastic was both thicker and used a sturdier clasping mechanism. If you have thick cables or multiple cables going to your monitor, they can pull the plastic cover off when you move the arm side to side.My second gripe with this arm is the wall mounted base. While it is small and easy to hold up while mounting since the base is separate from the arm, there are no square edges anywhere on the base; every side is rounded. This means that leveling the base is nearly impossible, since you can never be completely confident that you’re holding the level perfectly straight, it could be off by a degree or two. I’d like to see a revision of this product with a flattened top or bottom edge. (or better yet, an integrated level)As for the actual functionality of the arm though, it is top-notch. The arm feels durable and sturdy, and is capable of holding up fairly heavy monitors with a moderate curve. I’m using an Alienware AW3423DW with it which is about 16lbs. I have had no issues adjusting the monitor at all; all the adjustment screws are easy to reach with the appropriate tool. I do wish the arm had a way to store the Allen keys used to adjust the gas arm pressure and tensions.Pros:- Sturdy, high quality parts and materials.- Easy to adjust- Zero wobble- Excellent range of motionCons:- Upper arm uses zip ties for cable management.- Lower arm cable management sheath is flimsy and pops out easily under tension.- Wall mounted base is difficult to level because of the curved edges.",1

Culver,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2022","Pros - Strong enough, I think, for a Wacom drawing tablet. A wall mounted alt of the desk holder version people get for the drawing tablet. One Arm works best, compared to the two.Cons - the amount of play it has when the tablet moves.I am unsure how well I can explain this, but having it wall mounted instead of making a hole in my desk for the monitor arm is what I was aiming for. Mainly for my Wacom Drawing tablet, which is rated to be 16 or so pounds. So something that I think would be strong enough to hold it was what I want. Even more so from a brand that many that also have a wacom, has used. Maybe it is just me, but I'm not well comfortable in the amount of wobble it has, when I use it. I'm more or less afraid of it breaking, and breaking my tablet. The amount of play is coming from the joint neat the monitor itself. Not the rotation pivot behind the monitor, but the joint next to it (part of the system that raise and lower the whole mount). Where the monitor itself can more side to side. That is where the wobble is mainly coming from. I am unsure how to fix that, but be warry when you use it for the tablet, not for standard monitor use. Something for this price shouldn't do that.

And since I use a full size desktop, getting an adjustable desk or labtop stand waa not practical. So i looked into this and so far I am impressed. It has full range of motion. Allowing to swivel side to side and adjuse up and down. After installing it just yesterday, here are a few tips.1) Remember because this is wall mounted, you have have to make sure you have a sturdy surface to mount it to. Additionally, you also probably need a stud finder, because it has to be secure, So i would suggest finding the studs in the area you want to mount it first to make sure you have a safe and steady place to mount it too.2) I used mine for a 24in monitor which works fine...make sure your monitor has the vesa holes to wall mount on the back, not all monitors do. The company's website is actually very useful in making sure you get the right mount for your monitor and vice versa. I would check it out.3) My only con is that the instructions are poorly written, so it took alittle patience to figure out how exactly to adjust everything. My suggestion is that you probably want to mount the bracket a little higher at eye level, because the arm adjusts up and down! so that its high enough when you stand up and can also be adjusted below the mounting bracket to eye level when you sit down. I mounted mine a little on the lower side so when I stand up the monitor is not quite at eye level like I wanted, but at this point I'm not going to drill any more holes in the wall so, it works for me, but you want to make sure you get it just right for you.",1

I have one substantial problem with its design in my application: I needed to mount the monitor using the LX Mount above an existing eye level monitor. The LX arm allows for a vast range of motion, except when tilting the face of the monitor down (minus 5 degrees max according to the product specs). The monitor I'm using has a abrupt drop-off in brightness when viewed from a low angle and is virtually unusable with the tilt limit of the LX Mount.I remedied my problem by getting a pair of longer screws for attaching the LCD at the top of the LX mounting plate, with rubber spacers between the mount and the LCD. This adds a bit more negative tilt to the face of the LCD but is a kludge for an otherwise elegant piece of hardware. The tilt limitation is particularly frustrating in that the tilt in the opposite direction goes +80 degrees from vertical, facing up.There's a detailed set of dimensional drawings on the Ergotron web site that will help determine if the LX Mount will suit your application:[...]",0

When I inspect the components, though, I don't see why they couldn't have been made to do so. Under normal circumstances you aren't going to want to be tilting the monitor down anyway. It wouldn't be ergonomic. But these arms are designed for dynamic conditions. Every once in a while you are going to want them up above you and tilted down. Too bad.

Hides cables very well. There were some major things I needed an monitor arm to do which this met. First is the ability to fully rotate the monitor after mounting. There are some products which allow rotation but you have to do a lot of work. I am able to rotate the monitor easy after installing with a simple twist. Second is the ability to move the arm around easily with no need to ""lock"" it. This met that, though to ""tighten"" the arms is not with thumb bolts but with an allen wrench. It's nice it came with it but if you loose then you would have to go to the local hardware store and purchase one. This is a very minor flaw.All in all this is a great arm for the price.",1

My monitor isn't overly heavy, so there was no issue with load bearing on the arms. Freed up the space taken by a monitor on my desk; so happy to have that real estate available! The only quibble, I had to add rubber bumpers to the arm joint: when you push the monitor back after use, the joint hits the wall, making a mark.",1

Das stimmt leider so nicht. Die Halterung ist super verarbeitet, die Montage relativ einfach, der Umbau vom Cintiq, man muss ja die Kabelführung anpassen, damit man auf den Ständer verzichten kann. Jedenfalls das ging alles super, auch die VESA-Mount Halterung klappt einwandfrei, alles leicht zugänglich, alles in Ordnung.Der Hauptgrund für diesen Aufwand war die GERADE-Stellung des Monitors, den ich auch als Zweitmonitor nutze, damit die Reflexionen vom Deckenlicht minimiert werden. Damit lässt sich der Citinq als Zweitmonitor besser nutzen, weil man nicht so schräg schauen muss. Auch, wenn ich mich über die Jahre schon daran gewöhnt habe. Jedenfalls das geht super. Der Monitor schwebt nun ca. 10 cm über meinem Schreibtisch und ist an der Wand befestigt.Ich habe eine Leichtbauwand mit Holz und Rigips. Nur Rigips würde das Gewicht sicher nicht tragen, aber die Wandhalterung hat 2 fette Schrauben (13er Schlüsselweite) und Löcher für 4 weitere Spax, die dann aber recht eng an der Halterung sitzen. Mit diesen 6 Schrauben mache ich mir keine Sorgen. Das wird halten.Warum nun nur 4 Sterne?Der Arm kann den Monitor nicht halten. Er sinkt so lange wie er kann, also bis zum Anschlag nach unten. Kein Problem, da ich die Höhe der Wandbefestigung in etwa so eingeschätzt habe, damit das passt. Und ich hätte es kaum besser treffen können. Die Monitorinhalte sind nun annährend auf einer Höhe.  Aber, wie gesagt, der Monitor kann nicht auf einen andere Höhe gehalten werden. Ganz klar ein Problem bei einer anderen Installation.Das Zeichen am Wacom geht super. Ich kann nun auch im Stehen zeichnen, was ich mal ausprobieren wollte. Aber normale, schnelle Bildbearbeitung, was die Hauptverwendung ist, geht wunderbar. Der Monitor wackelt natürlich ein wenig. Aber das ist zu verschmerzen. Klar, dass der nicht so fest sitzt, wie in der Tischhalterung.Der Plan den Monitor bis zu den Knien nach vorne zu bewegen, geht leider auch nicht. Da muss ich ggf. noch mal herumexperimentieren, welche Arbeitshaltung mir da besser bekommt. Wäre die Halterung in der Lage den Monitor vom Gewicht her zu halten, dann würde sich das eigentlich machen lassen. Naja, ein Feature auf das ich wohl verzichten kann.Der Monitor hängt nun erst ein paar Minuten. Sollte ich noch andere Erfahrungen machen, werde ich diese hier ergänzen. Diese Rezension soll anderen helfen, die auch überlegen, ob man den Cintiq nicht besser aufstellen kann. Ja, man kann, aber so die optimale Lösung ist dieses Produkt noch nicht. Für mich ist es akzeptabel, aber noch nicht das Optimum.",1

Das war eigentlich mein Hauptanliegen, weil mein Schreibtisch hinten eine Art Ablage hat was dazu führt, dass der Bildschirm viel zu hoch hängt.  Man kann ihn aber ohne Probleme ca 20 cm nach unten und 20 cm nach oben bewegen.- Die Beweglichkeit- Der Platzgewinn am Schreibtisch (Ich habe einen Samsung Bildschirm der einen riesigen ovalen Fuß hat. Abgesehen davon kann man diesen Fuß kaum  verstellen)- Die verstellbarkeit des Winkels.  Mein Monitor sieht aus unerfindlichen Gründen am besten aus wenn ich ihn ca. 5 bis 10 Grad vornüberneige- die leichtgängige Vestellbarkeit.  Ich habe bisher tatsächlich gar nix eingestellt und das klappt bisher wunderbar.- Der (dafür) faire PreisWas mir nicht gefallen hat:- Die Kabelvorrichtung. Während im nicht höhenverstellbaren Teil die Kabel verdeckt im Arm verlaufen sind sie am höhenverstellbaren Teil nur durch Kabelbinder an Haken befestigt. Dazu kommt dass die Kabelbinder bei starken Armbewegungen aus den Haken rutschen.- Der Monitor ist nach verstellen des Arms meistens leicht nach rechts oder links verdreht. Liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass die Scharniere ein wenig Spielraum zur Bewegung lassen müssen, dennoch muss man dort öfter nachjustieren. Da das drehen des Bildschirm ein wenig schwergängin ist, ist es Teilweise ein ewiges hin und her bis der Bildschirm endlich gerade ist.- Dass man anscheinend den Fuß für die Tischmontage nicht einzeln nachkauffen kann. Ich habe mir den Fuß für die Wandmontage gekauft (hält bombenfest obwohl ich ehrlich gesagt viel kleinere Schrauben als die gelieferten benutzt habe) und möchte eventuell in ferner Zukunft meinen Arm an einem Tisch montieren. Habe allerdings noch keine Möglichkeit gesehen diese Teil einzeln zu kaufen. Irgendeine Wand wird schon in der nähe sein :)Fazit:Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meinem Bildschirmhalter und würde ihn wieder kaufen :)",1

I ordered at the same time a Silverline socket set which made the job of tightening the bolts into the drilled holes for the mount plate, much easier. Given a decent drill, it was a 10 minute job to mount the arm on a masonry wall.As other reviewers have stressed, spend a minute measuring and marking the out the height (from the floor) you want the mount plate installed. Placed too high and you may struggle to lower your monitor nearer your desk.The only reason the product itself doesnt get full 5 stars is the usual pound sterling premium over the American price. This is $100 on amazon US, and £106 on the Uk site here. Still, better value than it used to be, and its a monitor wall mount that does its job effectively.",1

Somit schwebt er nun über meinem Schreibtisch und wenn ich mehr Schreibfläche benötige schwenke ich ihn entweder zur Seite, nach hinten oder lifte ihn nach oben.Das ist echt toll und geht sehr leicht.Montiert ist der Arm an einer Rigips-Wand. Angesichts des durchaus hohen Eigengewichts hatte ich Bedenken, ob die Wand die Kräfte aufnehmen kann. Klappt aber hervorragend.Einen Stern muss ich dennoch abziehen, da der Monitor beim Schwenk des Arms in eine weit rechte oder linke Position nicht horizontal bleibt und sich leicht zu der Seite neigt, in der der Arm geschwenkt ist. Zwar kann man den Monitor jedesmal geradedrehen, das ist aber etwas lästig.",1

There are few wall-mount swing arms that offer the versatility of the Ergotron Lx.  And there are even fewer that compete at this price, which is substantial but worth it in my opinion.Right out of the box, you can tell that this is a quality product.  From the heavy 80mm hardened steel mounting bolts, to the mounting wall anchor with plastic vanity covers for the bolts, to the precision movement in the arm itself, there is no doubt that you are getting what you pay for.  The Ergotron Lx both looks nice and feels nice.  I am very happy with my purchase, which was hard to do.  After all, it's ~$120 just to mount a monitor on a wall.  But when you consider the quality of the product with the ergonomic configurations it offers, it's totally worth the cost.  And let's be honest, ergonomics are expensive in general, so this is really not such a terrible price.The product installed relatively smoothly.  I did not have a drill bit that could completely bore an 80mm hole to accommodate the massive bolts, but after some ratcheting it all worked out.  After that, attaching the VESA mount to the Monitor was a cinch with included thumb screws or, if you don't like thumb screws, Phillips-head screws.  But who doesn't like thumb screws?  Then it was just a matter of sliding the arms on top of their respective mounts.  Adjustments for each of the joints could be easily done with an Allen wrench (provided, if you don't have one).Adjusting the Lx was simple enough.  You can tighten the spring-arm so that it can support your monitor weight or you can make the joints stiffer or looser per your preference.  I found that the joint to swivel the monitor right and left was a bit stiff even at its loosest, but I don't take issue.  The adjustment to tighten the spring-arm is hidden so you'll need to read the manual to find that one.The manual was quite detailed in many respects, but could probably benefit from some proof-reading.  There are no explanations -- only diagrams.  And not all of the items pictured in the diagrams are accurate.  Minor stuff though.  They'll have a picture of a Phillips-head screw, but be using a hex Allen wrench in the diagram.  The manual is also laid out weird so that it's not completely obvious which diagram is relevant.  But the product is fairly simple to install so the shoddy manual is forgivable.  I found that the suggestion for a 3/16 drill bit to bore the hole for the 80mm bolts was insufficient.  I went a little larger myself.Among that which has already been described, the unit also includes a plastic cover underneath the rear ""bone"" of the arm to manage cables to your monitor.  It clips in nicely to neatly hold strong a decent amount of cable.  The arm itself has a very impressive range of motion.  When you move it up and down, it moves the VESA mount synchronously to maintain the configured angle of the monitor.The reason I purchased this was because my monitor was too far across my desk and I had to lean over to see causing some major issues with my mouse arm being bent and all.  Now I have both newly freed desk space as well as much less pain in my mouse arm.  Plus I can see the monitor a lot better.  I could have purchased a $40 swing arm to get the job done,  but the versatility in being able to raise and lower the monitor on-demand is quite worth it.  I highly recommend this product.Positives:- Quality Design- Versatility- Ease of use and installation- Ergonomically pleasing- Aesthetic detailNegatives:- Instruction manual needs work- Only supports up to 20 lbs or 22"" monitors",2

I've installed countless ""el cheapo"" LCD wall mounts & none of them had self leveling arms or swivel for that matter. None of them were built like this thing is, cast aluminum arms and aluminum wall bracket. You will probably want to loosen the leveling spring with the enclosed Allen wrench before you try to figure out where you want to mount it.  It will outlive you if you install it and use it within its listed application. If there is one gripe to be had it would be that the joints are riveted together which would be no issue unless they loosen up over time. I haven't had it that long to determine that would happen. It has built-in cable routing channels and a black cover that clips over the underside of the arm. There are covers for the bracket as well as the open ends of the arm sections to give the clean look by covering up the lag heads.I'm impressed. I've been in the IT business for 20 years and I've never seen such a well made LCD arm. I installed this in my house, in my computer room, to liberate me from the decades of being behind a desk and fighting to find comfortable computer chairs. Seems like computer chairs get more expensive though built with less quality, cheaper materials, and even smaller dimensions. My last straw was investing 300 in a chair and obviously being less than happy with it I decided to go this route.I purchased the keyboard tray and arm from Ergotron as well. I have a Logitech G15 keyboard and it sits on the board but overlaps both sides by about 1-1/2"". Not enough to restrict mouse use on the slide pad. I can't quite get it situated where its comfortable just yet. It doesn't have a forward tilt. I have a feeling it will have to go to my local machine shop for some modifications. It tilts up for storage but doesn't tilt any farther down than 90 degrees. That's not good enough typing from a recliner. If it only had 10-15 degrees of forward tilt it'd be perfect too. If its arm joints weren't riveted a modification like this would not be hard. As it is I suspect we'll end up drilling the rivets to separate the joint behind the keyboard and knock off enough material where it hits in the down position to drop it a little more. This modification would definitely void your warranty but it would make the keyboard tray a lot more comfortable for folks that play from a recliner.All in all both products from Ergotron are top notch and worth the price. It's priceless to me, no more back pain from the hunched over the computer desk position. I almost feel a little guilty now for the other folks that are still gaming at their desks and I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. =)Update: After having used the keyboard tray for a week or so there are adhesive backed gliding strips under the mouse tray. One of the strips peeled up and got caught inside the keyboard tray, restricting its movement. I was just able to remove that strip from inside the keyboard tray. I would have thought that for 200 dollars nearly the glides would have been of better, longer lasting quality.",1

It is very easy and simple to install, just make sure you get the two bolts secured into the wood stud in the wall and not just through drywall, drilling a pilot hole for the bolts first help. After getting the bolts and plate secured to the wall, it's only a simple task of stacking the arms on top of each other to get the desired length.  I had purchased an extra arm extension to that I could extend my monitor further away.  The last step is to just take off the mount on your monitor and attach it to the wall mount.My computer desk is only a few feet away from my bed, so sometimes it is very convenient to just move the monitor and have it faced towards my bed so that I can watch movies on my computer right from my bed, and wireless peripherals make it that much better! Since installing this wall mount, I have not had any worries or problems with it, even with the extension arm, it feels very safe and sturdy.  This wall mount is a real space saver, my HP monitor had this gigantic and cumbersome mount that took a lot of space on my desk, now with my monitor floating over my desk, it is a lot more cleaner looking and there is a heck of a lot more room to place whatever other junk I may have on my desk.  If you have a cluttered desk, having your monitor float will make it look a whole lot cleaner or at least the illusion of it.  Just one caveat that you may need to be aware of, is that because the wall mount can hide the power and HDMI/VGA cables, and any additional wires you may have such as sound or for the usb hub on your monitor, inside its arms, it will shorten the amount of cable length you can work with.  For that I would suggest buying longer cables, since your computer and outlet may not be right under where you installed the wall mount.  Other than that, this is a great and high quality product, sure to impress anyone!",2

Schimmelman,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2014","I bought this to replace an arm that I had been using for over 15 years and finally gave it up.  It only died because of a manufacturing defect that took that long to break.  This arm is a similar design, but much more sleek and stylish.  It has more vertical and extension distances and the friction settings were perfect right out of the box.  It looks good and is heavy duty, using aluminum alloy parts.  Now for the modification part.My screen is above me when I'm in my easy chair, so it needs to tip down.  Several other reviewers have complained that it only tips down a slight amount, and it's true.  It's right there in the spec.  For some unknown reason they bent a couple small tabs from the steel part of the pivot so they hit against the aluminum casting to limit the tip.  It would be easy to grind the tabs off or grind the aluminum down with a dremel tool, but that would scatter metal dust and grinding powder all over and make a mess.Instead, I took a small pair of vise grips and took a deep grip on the tab, but not real tight, and used a bit of squeezing and bending to straighten it up about 2/3 of the way.  Then I took a tighter grip with the end of the tool right at the bend point and straightened it almost all the way.  Finally I took another deep grip that was tight to smooth out the metal at the bend.  Do that for both sides and in about 10 minutes your screen will pivot down, and there's no mess and nothing to paint.They could have eliminated a manufacturing step and produced a better project.  What were they thinking?I haven't noticed any side effects.  It holds the wires better than my other arm, and was 1/3 the price.",1

The first set of arms I purchased, 2 monitor arms and 2 keyboard arms, have been holding up very well, look great, and work great.I needed to purchase another monitor arm because I added another system to my office setup, and was a little surprised that Ergotron changed the finish - it is now a stainless steel 'like' finish, shiny and polished. This is a step up from a quality appearance from the last version of their product, which is more of an aluminum matte type of finish. I do like them both, and although they mismatch in appearance, I like the appearance of this arm better. *if you are adding to your existing Ergotron arms that have the matte finish, and appearance is an issue for you, you may want to consider this and possibly buy an entire new set - if you have the funds...Ergotron updated the cable management system - it is no longer the ""snap-in"" system, it is a solid cover now that clips into the arm. It slides and clips. It's a little tricky the first couple times you try it - after you understand how it is put together, it is pretty easy to add/remove cables.Installation is easy, given you have the proper tools - namely, you need a DEEP-WELL SOCKET with a ratchet to bolt this thing onto your wall. Do NOT ATTEMPT without the proper tools, otherwise you will strip the head and get frustrated and leave bad comments like I've seen others do.Black snap-on bolt head covers, along with the sleek new polished steel look of the arm, makes this a beautiful system. The tilt work a bit differently from previous version - more of a slide system moving up and down the rail - but I don't find it better or worse than the previous version arm.I love the system. I don't think you can find a better consumer rated system out there. High quality, functional, looks great.",2

I want to say I spent less than 30 minutes from the time I started to the time it was up and running.  I have set up other mounting arms that attached to the desk or were free standing.  With those devices I found that getting the monitor attached to the mounting plate is always difficult.  Attaching other devices to the edge of a desk can also be cumbersome.The design of this arm is very simple.  The plate that attaches to the wall does not have the swivel arm permanently attached.  That makes it very small and light.  I located the wall stud and drilled the two 5/16"" holes needed in just a few minutes.  The mounting bolts are three inches long, so you need to have a long drill bit.  I used a 1/4"" drive ratchet with a 1/2"" socket to install the two bolts.  The bolts are listed as 13mm but the 1/2"" socket did work.  However, it was ""snug"" fit for the socket.If you don't have a socket set, you may have trouble getting the bolts completely tight.  There is a ""U"" shaped area where the bolts fit.  You would not be able to get a crescent wrench or a pair of pliers in there easily.Once the plate was mounted to the wall, the first arm just drops into place on the spindle in seconds.Mounting the second arm to the monitor was also very simple.  Four thumb screws are provided.  It was very simple for me to lay the monitor on its face and line up the mounting holes.  The plate has holes for 100mm and 75mm.The provided thumb screws were the correct size to fit into my monitor.  Because you are only holding one of the arms while you attach it to the monitor, it is a one person job.  The arm is light enough to be held with one hand while you line up the holes.  Your free hand can then start the thumb screws into holes.  You are not trying to juggle the arm, a screw and a screwdriver at the same time.Once the arm was mounted to the monitor, it drops into place on the spindle at the end of the first arm.  At this point, you have a usable system.  By grasping the sides of the monitor, you can move it around or rotate it.The remaining steps are mostly cosmetic.  There are two plastic covers that snap over the top and bottom of the wall mounting plate to cover the bolts.  There is also a plastic cover to snap over the spindle at the ""elbow"" of the two arms.  That took less than two minutes to put those on.  You might want to watch the YouTube video on this arm.  It shows the assemble steps.Dressing the cable by attaching them to the arms was a little awkward.  Two black zip ties are provided in the package.  They are used to attache the wires to the mounting arm attached to the monitor.  There are two protrusions on the bottom of the arm that the zip ties go over.  You have to do this pretty much by feel when the monitor sits over a desk.The arm attached to the wall has a removable plastic cover that will expose the channel for the cables.  I have three cables to my monitor (HDMI, VGA and power).  Getting them lined up inside the cover and getting it reattached to the arm was also a little awkward.  The cables were a little stiff and kept wanting to jump out of the channel.  I was leaning over the desk and the top of the monitor trying to do this.Like some of the other reviews, my only downside on this mounting arm is the instructions.  The instructions consist of one sheet of paper approximately 11"" by 17"" printed on both sides.  They show five steps but is it not the logical order in which you need to proceed.Step 1 is a chart that shows how high off the floor the wall bracket needs to be.  There are four columns and six rows of entries.  Two columns are for 4x3 monitors and two columns are for 16x9 monitors.  For each monitor aspect ratio, there is a column for sitting and one for standing.  The six rows in the table are for various monitor sizes ranging from 15"" to 22"".The first time I looked at the chart, I found it confusing. I then realized the variations in the measurements was approximately 2"" for a seated user.  For example, the wall plate should be mounted 34.9"" off the floor for a 15"" 16x9 monitor.  A 22"" 16x9 monitor should be 33.2"" off the floor.  Since the mounting arm will move up and down approximately 6.5"", it didn't really matter how precise you mounted the bracket to the wall.I put the bottom of my wall mounting plate 4.5"" above the top of my desk.  The bottom of the 22"" monitor will come down to approximately 5"" from the top of my desk.Step 2 of the instructions was an ""exploded"" view of all of the mounting arm parts.  I don't understand why this is step 2.Step 3 is the wall plate mounting options. In addition to the bolts, plastic anchors are also provided if you want to install this into a concrete wall.  The instructions show an optional wall track and bracket that can be purchased separately.  That might be nice if you want to adjust the monitor between a sitting and a standing position.Step 4 shows how to adjust the tension.  There is a step 4a and 4b for the two different adjustments.  Step 4 covers about 80% of one side of the instructions.  Most of that is four different warnings in nine languages.Step 5 shows a set screw on both spindles that can be tightened.  I suspect that tightening these two screws would lock the arm in position.  A 2.5mm wrench is provided to do this.  If the first arm is perpendicular to the wall, you would probably not be able to get the wrench into the set screw.I do like this mounting arm.  I am considering getting a second one for other monitors on my desk.",1

I have used their medical grade mounts for years and before ordering two of these, I tried going the cheap route with the Amazon knock odd brands.  For me those didn’t work because I use dual 32inch HP omen monitors.  I like to use them vertically only.  The issue with my screens is although they are vesa mounted, the mount is on the lower end of the monitor in the back and not in the center.  They are also heavy af.With these mounts I am able to easily move and adjust the monitors to where they are inches off my desk without having to use a stilt or small piece of wood to hold the monitors up.The only issue I have is because of how my monitors are built and them not being centered is that when they are tilted vertically, the mounts aren’t as precise at sticking the pivot circular joint, so the monitors may be off a few degrees of 90 degree angle.. this looks terrible.. what I ended up doing is getting the monitors in the right vertical angle, and then placed a screw in the pivot circle to lock it in place.  Again, I only needed to do this because of terrible HP design.If ergotron could give us the option to lock in place or make that circular rotation joint have more tension it would get a complete 5 stars.",1

I have a piano keyboard for a desk.  There are times that I want to read/write using a ""traditional"" music stand, but there are times that I want to read/write using my computer.  I used to have my computer monitor just off to the side of my music stand, but I found my neck would start hurting after a while (i.e. my body is squared to the keyboard but my head is turned to the right to see my monitor).The Ergotron LX is so flexible, that I can literally put it anywhere I want it with just a quick motion -- no loosening and tighting the joints because it's all counter balanced with tension springs.  I mounted it to the wall behind my music stand, so the arm would go around it.  Now I can position the monitor in front, above, or to the side and angle it to match with one motion.The arm is wall mounted with lag bolts (included) that go right into the stud.  I would not recommend trying to butterfly anchor in between studs, because the dry wall may fatigue over time as you move the monitor around (there will be a bit of tension on the mount).  I would also recommend using a socket (as advised in the mounting instructions) for driving the lag bolts into the stud (you still need to pre-drill), because the holes are sunken for a flush finish and a open end wrench, pliers, or channel locks will only go so far.My delivery was as expected, and the Ergotron LX showed up as new.  I'm very pleased with the shipping and handling, the product, and the price.  I'm very satisfied with what I bought!",2

I have one monitor for my computer and I mounted a second (and identical) 21"" monitor on my office wall so that clients can see what I am looking at on my screen.  I am a lawyer. When I wantto review long documents with clients before signing, I simply move the second monitor away from its parking space on the wall to a convenient place for my clients to read the screen.  If we identify anything we want to change, I make the changes without wasting a lot of printing time and paper. When the document is perfect, we print it out once and sign.The Ergotron LX Wall Mount LCD Arm has worked well for me.  The tension in the arms is adjustable, so I can match the arm to the weight of the Samsung SyncMaster 213T 21"" LCD Flat Panel Monitor and it holds its position well.  When we are done using the monitor, I can collapse the arm against the wall and the second monitor is out of the way.  The Ergotron LX Wall Mount LCD Arm has a good appearance as well; it does not look cheesy.The whole trick here is to make sure the unit is solidly bolted onto the wall.  I didn't use a mounting plate, but you might have to if you don't have a convenient stud location in the wall.  The Ergotron LX has plastic covers (also not cheesy) that hide the wall bolts and gives the unit a nice look.  There is no getting away from the power and video cables that feed the monitor, but the Ergotron LX does as well as can expected to hide as much of the cabling as possible.  I am very satisfied and not all that easy to please.  I recommend this product.",2

I opted to purchase it and I could not be more pleased with it.Easy to mount to the wall, very well designed, and allows free articulation and positioning of the LCD with easy and precision.  I am using it as a swing-out and position perpendicular to a side wall to where I sit and it works great.The only thing to keep in mind with this wall mount is that it will not allow you to position the Monitor downward more then about 7 inches from the horizontal arm.  Not a concern in my case, and probably not for most cases, but be aware as if you intend to mount it high and want to bring it down.. that won't work as it's not designed for that.  So plan for ~ eye level positioning of the LCD panel relative to the mount point of the arm to the wall and you will be fine.The manual (actually a large fold out double sided sheet) is the usual confusing multi-language instruction sheet.  Once I highlighted the English sections it was easy to use.  I recommend you spend a little time familiarizing yourself with all the tension adjustments before you mount it.. that way.. you are ready and know where to adjust as you install and attach an LCD panel.  I put a 22 in 16:9 7lb panel on it and it worked great. Final tension adjustments about 10-15% up from minimum settings.",2

However, the cabinet was too high to just place the monitor inside.  The surface areas and light weight of the furniture prohibited the use of an articulating desk mount.  So I came up with the idea to remove the back of the cabinet, mount the computer on the wall, and pull it out and down when needed.  My husband was able to make it happen by mounting the arm just to the left of center.  The computer now gets stowed away inside the cabinet which makes our house look neater (I'll take all the help I can get), but it's easy to bring it out all the times it's used in a day.*I looked up the weight rating for this because another review/answer said it could bear up to 25lb.  The Ergotron site does state up to 25lb, however in the directions it states that a 25lb monitor would decrease the range of motion of the arm because you have to tighten the hydraulic part of the arm.  Our monitor is not quite that heavey and is able to move as much as we need, so we have no complaints there.",1

I have 2 units that I mounted together for a dual screen configuration. Installation was a snap. The screens move in any direction that you can think of, including rotating and tilting. The screens stay where you put them. The units are well made and seem to be over built. They are sturdy and solid. The units are mounted under a desk transaction counter and can be pulled out and raised when used or tucked under when not. This unit has an advantage over the competition because the arm mounting to the monitor is the arm giving the vertical movement. The fixed height (but not fixed movement) allows the vertical arms to be pulled out and clear the transaction counter before being raised, conflict free. Many of the others I have seen has the arm at the wall being the one giving the vertical control. This limits the height the monitor can be raised because the arm with the vertical adjustment would hit the underside of the counter. I hope that made sense.Well thought out. Built solid. Easy to install. Trouble free ever sense. Any product with all of these qualities get my recommendation.",2

This required some extra parts, since this TV has VESA 200x200 screw holes and this wall arm only accommodates 100x100 and 75x75. First, I needed bracket extenders (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032HHXVM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5), and then I needed to go to the hardware store and buy 4 M8 screws (25mm in length). This is a bit of a bummer, since the Ergotron sit-stand wall mount I bought already came with this stuff. But once I figured all this out, it worked great. Other than that, I only have two complaints: 1) The two arm pieces are only held together by gravity. This means that you could simply lift the arm up and it would detach. This isn't likely to happen, but I'd like the reassurance that it can't happen (again, the other Ergotron arm has a screw that prevents this). And 2) the part that connects to the wall is made of shiny plastic. This means that in the dark, it reflects light and is pretty distracting. My other Ergotron arm has a matte finish so this doesn't happen.",-1

Finch,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2015","We have a ton of the desk clamping versions of these at work, and when I purchased a new monitor for home, I wanted one of my own.  This thing is a tank, steel construction, super heavy duty, weights a lot!  The mounting bolts are borderline intimidating and look like they could support an elephant!  Range of motion is super impressive and it very easy to move around.  Installation is not too bad (though putting the bolts into a stud is stressful).  I highly recommend you have a buddy help you out, a second set of hands really makes this easier.  I also cannot recommend installing this into drywall, no matter what anchors you are using, way too much risk.  The range of motion is good enough that you can find a stud.I have this holding a BenQ BL3200PT (32inch LED, weights about 18 pounds without the stand) and its having no problem at all.  That being said, not sure I would want to mount anything bigger just to be safe.",1

Did not plan it that way. Mounted the second monitor about a year after the first. Used one of the extension arms for extra clearance. Very impressed with the full range of motion these arms provide. You also get hex wrenches that allow you to loosen/tighten the arms in place. That is not obvious from the description, or I missed it when I bought my first one. Another great feature is you attach your monitor while last part of the arm is off the wall. Then you just slide the arm on the pole. Simple, no hassles. I bought a different brand of mount for a couple of televisions to save money and had to attach the tv's to the mount once mount was on wall. I had no one to help. I had to buld a tower of rubbermaid containers, boxes and books to hold tv and match the holes. Never again. I will stick with the Ergotron brand. If they don't make one large enough then this style for the ease of mounting television.",2

It was quite simple to put together and install.  The instructions were helpful and it came with all the parts required, as well as 3 hex wrenches to adjust the various tension points on the unit.  Other tools required for installation included a drill and bit (3/4"" I believe) and a ratchet with a 13 mm socket (if I recall correctly).  That's for installation mounted to a 2x4 behind drywall.  They also included concrete anchors if you should need them.The arm supports the 23"" monitor quite well, and does a good job of routing the cords around so that they look as nice as can be expected.  It does wiggle a bit more than I had hoped for when actually using the touch screen, but it really can't be easily manipulated and rock-solid at the same time unfortunately, and the ability to maneuver it with ease is much more valuable than a wiggle-free touchscreen experience.",1

Kind of a bummer as I was trying to build a reclined seating workstation for my old sedentary job.In any case though, this thing is awesome. I'll probably get two more.

Be sure to have a ratchet with 13mm socket handy as it would be virtually impossible without it.I mounted it on a stud for the sturdiness, but realized afterwards that if it's against the wall I have no flexibility to move the monitor left-to-right. When tucked back, the center of the monitor is about 2 inches to the left (or right) of where it's attached.With tension adjusted (using supplied tool) the monitor sits just where I want it.  It moves up and down easily and tilts nicely.Cables management is good.  There is a covered compartment for the first segment.  The second segment is attached using cable ties.  I would have preferred a compartment here too--perhaps in the next version.Overall, I highly recommend this product.",1

I stumbled on Ergotron, and quickly discovered what an awesome brand they are. Their products are top notch. My initial mounting project was going to involve a 27"" LED Apple Cinema Display and a 27"" iMac (the 2011 model, not the new thin one). The LX works GREAT for the Cinema Display, but unfortunately in my research, I got the wrong weight rating for the iMac and it turns out it's too heavy for this arm. However, after trying one other brand which turned out to be terrible quality, I had a great phone conversation with Ergotron customer service and discovered that their MX mount (the big brother to this one) works great at holding the iMac. I've got both mounted now in our office and am VERY happy with them.",2

These are a sleek functional monitor arm that includes the hardware for most installations. I have installed them to the wall for a kiosk area and most have been installed on the side of desks so that the monitor appears to ""float"" over the corner of the desk and can be turned out of the way if not needed. I have used these with 17"", 19"", and 21"" monitors and have also used them with touch screen Sympodiums. They have held up well except for the ones that get pushed all the way up and down on a daily basis which then need to be tightened occasionally to hold their place.",1

I would not purchase it again.I've used it with several combinations of monitors and am currently using it with a 32"" Dell U3219Q and a laptop tray.The good news is that the monitor arm itself is sturdy and holds a lot of weight.  I've never had a problem getting it adjusted for any combination of dual 27"" monitors, or a split between a 32"" and a 27"" monitor.  Others mentions issues with tensioning, but that was not my experience.However, this is where the good ends.  Here's the bad.1. The VESA mounts that attach to the monitor and then clamp on to the mount rail are really wobbly.  If you're looking directly at your monitor, and you imagine the motion you would use to rotate a monitor into a vertical orientation, this is the axis upon which the mount will wiggle a significant number of degrees.  It's bad enough that when I press the menu button on the bottom of my monitor, the monitor rotates up and knocks the monitor out of alignment.  The clamp needs to be shimmed or made flush with the rail somehow.  This is very annoying.2. The handle hangs pretty low below the monitors.  It's intrusive enough that I may as well use a monitor stand as it prevents access to items below the monitors.3. The cable management routing along the monitor rails is not sufficient for newer monitors that have embedded KVM switches or large USB hubs.  The cable routing solution does not adequately hide all of the device cables coming out of the monitor.",-1

While I have multiple Erogtron mounts in my home and office, I found this particular mount to be more expensive and time-consuming to align compared to the others.The mount is sturdy and well-built, similar to other Erogtron products I own. However, the alignment process was a bit challenging. The rotation alignment screws are located behind the monitors and are not clearly shown in the instructions, making it difficult to find and adjust them. It took me some time to get both displays even and properly aligned.Once installed, the mount does look good and holds the heavy Apple Studio Displays securely. However, the overall experience with this mount was not as seamless as I had hoped, given my previous experiences with Erogtron products. I would recommend this mount just set aside an extra two hours for proper adjustment.",0

Trying a new 28-inch monitor, the weight exceeded the capacity of the old stand; that monitor sagged and could not stay vertical. The Ergotron HX Dual keeps monitors aligned while repositioning at will.Putting the HX Dual together is a two-person operation when attaching four screws to each VESA display. We did not find a ""fix"" guide in the instructions to indicate where and what to tighten to resolve specific issues. That would have been helpful for final adjustments.Bottom line: highly recommended premium arm for workstations to maximize productivity with two (or three if ordered) monitors.",1

I would not purchase it again.I've used it with several combinations of monitors and am currently using it with a 32"" Dell U3219Q and a laptop tray.The good news is that the monitor arm itself is sturdy and holds a lot of weight.  I've never had a problem getting it adjusted for any combination of dual 27"" monitors, or a split between a 32"" and a 27"" monitor.  Others mentions issues with tensioning, but that was not my experience.However, this is where the good ends.  Here's the bad.1. The VESA mounts that attach to the monitor and then clamp on to the mount rail are really wobbly.  If you're looking directly at your monitor, and you imagine the motion you would use to rotate a monitor into a vertical orientation, this is the axis upon which the mount will wiggle a significant number of degrees.  It's bad enough that when I press the menu button on the bottom of my monitor, the monitor rotates up and knocks the monitor out of alignment.  The clamp needs to be shimmed or made flush with the rail somehow.  This is very annoying.2. The handle hangs pretty low below the monitors.  It's intrusive enough that I may as well use a monitor stand as it prevents access to items below the monitors.3. The cable management routing along the monitor rails is not sufficient for newer monitors that have embedded KVM switches or large USB hubs.  The cable routing solution does not adequately hide all of the device cables coming out of the monitor.",-1

Ceci nécessite donc de réorienter les écrans à chaque fois. Dans le cas d'un bras avec un écran unique, ce n'est pas un vrai problème car l'écran se réoriente très facilement. Avec ce bras à deux écrans, les écrans sont souvent ""collés"" l'un contre l'autre et cela devient un problème particulièrement gênant.De plus, la poignée aide effectivement à déplacer le bras mais l'effort à fournir peut parfois être important pour un usage fluide. Pas de problème pour monter/descendre, mais un effort certain à fournir pour avancer/reculer que je n'ai pas constaté avec un Ergotron LX mono écran.J'ai retourné ce produit pour ces raisons.

While I have multiple Erogtron mounts in my home and office, I found this particular mount to be more expensive and time-consuming to align compared to the others.The mount is sturdy and well-built, similar to other Erogtron products I own. However, the alignment process was a bit challenging. The rotation alignment screws are located behind the monitors and are not clearly shown in the instructions, making it difficult to find and adjust them. It took me some time to get both displays even and properly aligned.Once installed, the mount does look good and holds the heavy Apple Studio Displays securely. However, the overall experience with this mount was not as seamless as I had hoped, given my previous experiences with Erogtron products. I would recommend this mount just set aside an extra two hours for proper adjustment.",0

Hurley,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2017",I would have given it 5 stars but it has no lift tension adjustment on the swing arm. Because of that my monitors being on the upper limit of the weight spec won't allow the arm to stay up when raised.Using smaller lighter monitors would work for this unit. Just a shame they don't allow to adjust that arm for lifting tension.,0

After reading the reviews and considering many other options decided to give it a go and glad I did.  It's on the pricey side but you do get your moneys worth.  It looks very smart and is very sturdy.  I like that you adjust the tension on various movements so that whatever monitors you install you get a fluid movement and the position stays.  No drooping over time.  A little fiddly to get right initially but worth it.  Cable routing is also pretty good.  Not perfect but good enough in my humble opinion and I'm fairly fussy about cables.  I have the back of the monitors facing the open room so it needs to look neat.  Debated as to whether to give it 5 or 4 but concluded as it wasn't perfect I needed to make it 4.  Close call.,1

Da es sich bei den beiden Monitoren um sehr hochwertige Monitore handelt, wollte ich bei der Halterung nicht sparen und habe zu einer teureren Halterung gegriffen.Die Halterung von Ergotron ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und ist leicht anzubringen und einzustellen. Die Verarbeitung ist sehr gut und die Kabel lassen sich durch die Kabelmanagementmöglichkeiten an den Armen leicht ordentlich unterbringen.Der einzige Nachteil ist (Der Grund für 4 Sterne anstatt 5), dass bei der Anbringung von unterschiedlichen Monitoren mit unterschiedlich hohen VESA-Halterungen keine Möglichkeit besteht einen Monitor in der Höhe zu verstellen, dass bspw. die Oberkante bei beiden Monitoren auf gleicher Höhe liegen. Da es bei mir allerdings weniger als 1cm beträgt ist es verschmerzbar.",1

Trying a new 28-inch monitor, the weight exceeded the capacity of the old stand; that monitor sagged and could not stay vertical. The Ergotron HX Dual keeps monitors aligned while repositioning at will.Putting the HX Dual together is a two-person operation when attaching four screws to each VESA display. We did not find a ""fix"" guide in the instructions to indicate where and what to tighten to resolve specific issues. That would have been helpful for final adjustments.Bottom line: highly recommended premium arm for workstations to maximize productivity with two (or three if ordered) monitors.",1

Ich bin sehr pingelig und habe jedes Bauteil genau untersucht. Nicht der kleinste Makel lässt sich erkennen und das Gewicht und Verarbeitung der einzelnen Arm-Bauteile lassen mir ein Wow entgleiten!Für mich ist das Qualität auf dem höchsten Niveau.Die Anleitung zum zusammensetzen der einzelnen Bauteile ist auf mehreren DIN A4 Seiten gedruckt und großzügig dargestellt. Alles ist klar erkennbar und der Zusammenbau verlief ohne Probleme.Hervorragend finde ich, dass die einzelnen Schraubelemente gruppiert in mehreren Tütchen verpackt ist und der Inhalt mit der genauen Bezeichnung deklariert ist. Ein Verwechseln von Schrauben und Verbindungselementen ist damit völlig ausgeschlossen. Das erlebe ich so nur selten.Nach dem zügigen Zusammenbau und das Anbringen der Monitore neigt sich der Arm nach unten. Was ist das denn? Meine Monitore liegen mit der Hälfte der Belastung unterhalb der Belastungsgrenze.Nach einem Blick in die Einleitung weiß ich auch warum: Es gibt mehrere Stellschrauben, mit denen man perfekt alles auf seine Bedürfnisse einstellen kann. Ich bin selten so begeistert von einem Produkt!Bedenken hatte ich, ob die Halterung mit gut 10 Kilo Plus zwei Monitore mit jeweils 5 Kilo auch mit einem höhenverstellbaren Schreibtisch genutzt werden kann oder der Motor des Schreibtisches sich weigert. Funktioniert mir dem Schreibtisch von Ikea Idasen wunderbar.Diese Monitorhalterung kann ich uneingeschränkt empfehlen und ist jeden Euro Wert!Ich würde gerne 8 Sterne vergeben, geht aber nicht ;-)",2

Jeder der Monitore wiegt ohne Fuß etwa 6 kg.Der auf den Bildern zu sehende USB-Dock gehört nicht zum Lieferumfang.Die Montage geht auch mit geringem handwerklichem Geschick recht flott.Wer die Aufbauanleitung für ein Ikea Billy versteht, sollte hier keinen Grund für Verzweiflung finden.Der Ständer wiegt! Die angegebeben 11 kg sind kein Verschreiber! In meinem Fall liegen auf kleiner Fläche des Schreibtisches also über 20 kg auf. Ein Schreibtisch mit Metallunterkonstruktion ist da also hilfreich.Wird der Ständer so bewegt, dass die Monitore nicht mehr über der Platte schweben, sollte geschaut werden, dass das Gegengewicht des Tisches ausreicht, sonst droht ein Kentern des Schreibtisches!Dies ist nicht mein erster Halter, wohl aber der Erste in dieser Preisklasse. Es ist zu bedenken, dass der Ständer mehr kostet als die meisten Monitore.Aber - er ist jeden cent wert. Die Gesetze der Schwerkraft, Statik und Trägheit verhindern, dass da nie etwas nachschwingt, oder sich die Monitore mit dem kleinen Finger verstellen lassen. Aber die Verstellung funktioniert dennoch top! Der Griff erlaubt ein einfaches Anfassen und bei korrekter Einstellung der Federkraft ist ein zuverlässiges Verstellen möglich, ohne dass die Monitore übermäßig zurückschwingen.Die Kabelführung ist für 2 Strom und Monitorkabel sowie die USB Verkabelung der Monitore ausreichend bemessen.Sehr schön finde ich die Einstellmöglichkeiten: auch bei Schrägstellung (und gleichzeitig ""gebogen"") lassen sich die Monitore perfekt und bündig ausrichten. Endgültige Fixierung schaffen hier zwei mitgelieferte Klebestreifen, die rückseitig die Monitore verbinden.Wird volle Bewegungsfreiheit der Monitore gewünscht, sind ab Fuß des Ständers 1 1/2 Meter lange Kabel zu planen. Sollen kwie bei mir) die Monitore fixiert sein, reicht etwas mehr als ein Meter.Verbesserungswürdig halte ich die Horizontaleinstellung der Trägertraverse: so wie das Kippen der Monitore über eine Schraube gelöst ist, wünsche ich es mir auch für die Traverse. Auch ist ein Kippen der Traverse nicht vorgesehen, das ginge vermutlich zu Lasten der Stabilität.Optisch versprüht der Ständer den Charme einer Zahnarztpraxis, dass muss aber kein Nachteil sein: dieses Produkt ist durch und durch auf Zweckerfüllung konstruiert. Und dies ist eigentlich ein größtmögliches Kompliment an den Hersteller.Alles in Allem ein Monitorhalter als Geldanlage mit Ambitionen, in die Erbmasse einzugehen. So ein bisschen, wie Opas Hilti aus den 70ern.Wer das Geld ausgeben will, bekommt ein Qualität, die ein 50-€-Ständer nicht bietet.",2

That said, Ergotron support was really good. Even though the first line support was basically clueless and not comprehending what I said nor the pictures I provided, the follow-up was among the better customer support experiences I've ever had.That out of the way, it is a joy once assembled. It takes up a bit more space than I would have liked and it's annoying that you cant rotate all the way back and forward (so it takes up more actual desk space than I'd hoped instead of mounting at the edge and keeping the arms mostly behind and off the desk top), but it holds 2x 32"" monitors without breaking a sweat. Calibrating is very straight-forward and being able to move both monitors up, down and around as needed is a breeze.You really need a solid desk to mount this. I have a 38mm thick solid pine and the desk mount puts a visible strain on the desk so I added a stainless steel plate in between the desk and the clamp to help distribute the pressure.At the end of the day it lives up to its promises and leaves very little to want. I will eagerly buy more Ergotron mounts in the future as the office expands.",1

Cool monitor arm and I’m glad that it was a great solution for so many people but for me (so far) it’s bust. The clamp doesn’t open up wide enough to slide past the back plate on my desk. Ergotron provides another attachment option but that requires drilling a hole into my desk. Not sure I’m going to take that route. I like the idea of attaching the monitor arm via clamp because I can unclamp and reposition it without any sort of permanent damage. There’s no undrilling a hole once I’ve put one in/through my desk’s surface so mounting the monitor arm using that method…unappealing. My hopes for this device were not exactly sky-high. I just wanted to clamp it to my desk. In that simple matter it failed.Attempts to contact Ergotron on a Sunday were unsuccessful. I thought I could get in touch with someone since the phone number at store.ergotron.com boasted customers could call store support 24/7. I guess that was not totally incorrect. I can call them 24/7, it's just not guaranteed that someone will answer. That’s where the claim fell short. No doubt Ergotron has some excuse in the chamber to explain this away. Dialing the number on the installation instructions also took me to a recorded response. Both recordings supplied me with business hours (drastically reduced from the 24/7 claim found on store.ergotron.com) that I probably could’ve deduced on my own.So far this monitor arm is a waste of time, money and effort. There’s a good chance the thing will be going back. I’m going to reach out to Ergotron again. They seem to be a highly-revered company and I’m sure that some clever individual in their employ suggested making a clamp that opens up wider than the one that was packed in with the arm. And if that happened I’m going to suppose that some similarly-clever person put one such accessory into production. I did check for one on the website but found nothing. Its completely possible that I didn’t check in the right spot. I hope that’s the case.Looking back, I should’ve dug deeper for specs on the monitor arm but who knew I had such an exotic piece of office furniture? I just thought I had a desk. This review will be updated if a working solution for the arm can be achieved or if the over-hyped device is returned.8.1.20I returned the arm. Ergotron attempted to provide me with a solution. It failed. They came up with a way to widen the amount the clamp could open (up to 94mm) but it still wasn't enough to open up around the back of my desk (116mm). Amazon took the arm back (thanks Amazon because that dud wasn't cheap) and refunded the purchase price.One thing, the response from Ergotron was a bit presumptuous. It said that ""Without something custom the only option would be to use what I had."" Huh? Exactly what ""custom"" solution would I happen to have up my sleeve? My ""custom"" solution was to eschew the factory-supplied stand in favor of the Ergotron monitor arm. I didn't know I needed a second custom solution to get the first one off the ground.I did a cursory search for some kind of adapter but came up empty. That's enough. I need a monitor arm, not a weekend side project to last for the remainder of the year. I wish I could offer some comments about the performance of the arm once a monitor has been attached but I couldn't even get the thing mounted to my desk. I'm going to explore non-Ergotron-related options.",-2

It looks ok, but it will not properly position a Samsung Neo G9 in a standard wide screen orientation (width horizontal, height vertical).  Even with the tilt adjustment screw turned completely in, the screen tilt is excessive.  The top edge of the monitor drifts downward/forward putting the monitor at a downward facing tilt which is completely unacceptable for a wide screen monitor.  The webpage image showing this arm holding a 1000R wide screen monitor tilted upward is bogus.  The spring does not have the necessary tension to hold the monitor in such a position.I intended to replace a less expensive AVLT arm with this Ergotron HX arm because I hoped the Ergotron HX arm might be more stable but it's not.  The less expensive arm AVLT is at least able position the monitor properly.  As others have mentioned, the top portion of the arm is lacking a cable tray too.  Avoid this arm.This king (of arms) is definitely naked.--- Original ---I got the satin black finish but wanted white.  It seems like a well made arm, but I need to try it to be sure.  I'll update the review if they can manage to send me a white arm.",-2

Until this morning, I came home from being at a friend's house to find the monitor arm snapped in half and the monitor cracked and busted on the floor. I am so angry right now, not even worth returning the busted arm, especially since I now no longer have a monitor to put it on. A $1500 monitor destroyed. May not be a horrible brand but I got a defective one that also cost me my monitor.Just keep your monitor on the stand the company gave you, don't risk this happening to you!The monitor arm broke and my $2000 monitor is in pieces now. Due to my spouse throwing the arm out I am now out the money on the faulty arm too. Very dissatisfied and I will not be using Amazon again. I could understand if I had a history of returning items excessively or requesting other items be refunded without return. But I havent and have been pleased so far until this monitor arm.I will also be taking action against Amazon by filing Breach of Trust complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for failure to protect consumer from faulty goods and refusal to remedy the situation. I am also filing complaints with the BBB and talking with my lawyer about the legal actions we can take against these unfair business practices.Thank you for the time I enjoyed Amazon, however the last purchase I made will be my last, forever and will be canceling my Amazon prime account.",-2

Straining both your upper back and shoulderIt will cause tennis elbow if done for a prolonged period of time.The product says its sturdy and it is but i started noticing the products ability to lock in place left after about 3 weeks. Which felt really soddy to me. It would randomly shoot up if i stopped working for a momentIts fairly easy to install.At the end of the day after getting it in on may 14th (a week after ordering) it took about  8 weeks to start feeling the pain from the arm. So now im stuck with a nearly $300 arm that is not ergonomic enough to not cause pain, that bragged about being a computer designers best friend... because the sellers wont accept returns after 30 days.Im pretty dissapointed in the product.

I'm used to being able to return products on amazon if they don't work out, and i'm not used to waiting months for something to arrive.

Farmer,2024年8月27日 在美国审核,"It worked great for the first few months.Then, the gas piston started giving out, causing the monitor to sag and constantly requiring me to raise it back up by hand and try to tighten the adjustment screw.I eventually took the monitor off the arm (Samsung 49"" Odyssey btw) and tried to examine what was wrong.Ergotron doesn't make these arms very friendly to people like me who try to fix things. Getting the retaining clips to go back onto the gas piston was a massive PITA. After much struggling to get the pins aligned correctly, I got it back together and was able to adjust the piston's set screw.However, that still didn't completely fix it.  The monitor arm is still sagging, just not as bad.VERY disappointing, especially given how expensive this thing is.Also, it does not adequately raise the monitor to a proper eye level, resulting in neck strain. For reference, my desk height is 30"" and I'm 5' 9"". even with the monitor raised to ~ 20"" (using a 2 x 4 piece of wood for extra height), I'm STILL looking down at the monitor. It really needs to be able to raise up another 3-4"" for proper ergonomic viewing.",-2

Works as intended which is an actual plus. HOWEVER, the reason for this 2 star review is because the company sent me 2 monitor mounts that are ALUMINUM colored when I ordered WHITE. I messed up the installation of 1 of them and had to order another one. This next one sent to me was quick which was great and in the WHITE color which I wanted BUT the arm holding the monitor wouldn't fit into the base arm. Now I have to return this one and get a replacement. The amount of inconveniences I have to go through is just tremendous just go get 2 monitor mounts of the right color on my desk. In the end, most people shouldn't be able to see the monitor stands themselves but to have to go through this experience is painstaking and almost not worth it.In regards to the 2 stars on easy to assemble, for the most part it's easy but making adjustments is difficult. If you don't have a UW monitor, use the default monitor pivot they give you instead of the heavy duty tilt pivot. Mostly the difficulty comes from making the monitor arm go where you want it and staying and the monitor tilts.This monitor mount is sturdy and works as intended but with the inconveniences I went through with Ergo tron and the difficulty of adjustments, I wouldn't recommend people to buy monitor mounts from Ergotron. It would probably be better looking for a monitor arm just as good being sold from a different company. These monitor mounts weren't cheap either coming in at $300 only for the company to ship me wrong or defective products.",-1

The provided adapter for 200x200mm vesa mount makes me kinda uneasy mounting my $700 monitor. It’s 4 tabs sticking out in an X from the original mount. It’s got a bit of play in it.A shame because the arm feels nice and sturdy and can definitely support my monitor easy but the dodgey mount leaves doubt in my mind. For $300+ monies I expected a better mount.I’m keeping it still because I can easily manufacture an adapter plate.,-1

Mein 49"" Monitor hebt und sackt nicht ab. Billige Chinaprodukte für ~100€ haben zu schwache Neigungsgelenke.Mehr Gutes kann ich dann nicht mehr sagen. Das untere Gelenk das Armes ist schlicht und ergreifend überfordert mit dem Gewicht und somit sehr schwergängig. Ich kann den Monitor nicht greifen und einfach zu mir her ziehen wenn ich über den Schwenkbereich des oberen Gelenks hinaus möchte. Hier müssten geeignete Kugellager verbaut werden, da die Lagerung unten durch einen Zapfen immer verkanten wird. Ein billiger China Arm liefert hier dasselbe Erlebnis, da identisch gefertigt.Auch die Abdeckung des Kabelkanals und die sonstige Kabelführung ist billigst. Eine labbrige Plastikblende und zwei Fleecekabelbinder stehen hier zur Verfügung. Hier übertrifft das China-Produkt das Original sogar durch Kabelkanäle.Für einen Monitorhalter der so viel kostet wie ein ordentlicher Gamingmonitor oder drei einfache Officemonitore ist das ein Armutszeugnis. Könnte ich das HD Gelenk auf den China Arm adaptieren, wäre ich glücklicher.Dieser macht optisch mehr her und ist nicht sonderlich schlechter was Fertigungstoleranzen angeht.",-1

Habe schon sehr viele Einstellungen probiert und es bis jetzt noch nicht geschafft, dass ich eine deutliche Anstrengung der Augen im Vergleich zum vorherigen Setup verhindere. Zudem hab ich viele Versuche aufgegeben den Monitor so zu verwenden als wären es zwei (für leichteres Anordnen der Fenster und Bildschirmsharing). Die Software OnScreen Control hat den Nachteil, dass die Fenster automatisch auf die gesamte verfügbare Größe vergrößert werden und man kann sie auch nicht mehr verkleinern. Habe deswegen LG Support kontaktiert, aber bis jetzt noch keine Lösung erhalten. Auch die neueste Softwareversion 6.15 für MAC löst das Problem nicht. Den zweiten Versuch den Bildschirm mit einem Dock aufzuteilen (Laptop->USB-C-> Dock -> Display und HDMI Port) war nicht zufriedenstellend. Ich hatte zwar jetzt zwei Bildschirmhälften, aber irgendwie das Gefühl es ist unscharf. Ich hab in den verschiedenen Setups schon viele Einstellungen erfolglos probiert (Auflösung, Helligkeit, Kontrast und Picture Modes) und auch die Software des Monitors auf neuesten Stand kontrolliert. Probier jetzt mal mit einem einfachen Setup (Laptop -> USB-C -> Monitor) ob ich damit zurecht komme. Verwende den Monitor erst seit etwas mehr als einer Woche, daher kann ich über die Haltbarkeit und Stabilität nichts aussagen.",-1

Ich habe einen Samsung G9 Odyssey montiert und dieser wird nicht von dem Kopfgelenk gehalten, dies sollte man in die Produktbeschreibung dringend mit aufnehmen. Hierfür gibt es ein Upgrade was nur dieses Gelenk betrifft! D.h. man muss dieses Gelenk extra bestellen (ca. 65€) und austauschen um einen schwereren Monitor uneingeschränkt nutzen zu können!!!2. als Unding empfinde ich allerdings, dass sich der Verkäufer garnicht auf Anfragen meinerseits geäußert hat!

I bought it as soon as I found out we'd be working from home for a while, in an effort to finally upgrade my home setup. After I bought it I mentioned it to a friend, and she said ""YES!!! I HAVE THE SAME ONE AND I LOVE IT!!"" I've only had it for a couple of months, but my friend has had hers for years and it's still going strong.I have an enormous Cintiq - 24HD Touch. I was warned that if the weight of the screen to be supported is too close to the weight limit, it probably won't work well, and this was literally the only arm I could find that was rated to support my monster! Not only does it hold the weight of my Cintiq beautifully, the motion is smooth and effortless, only a very slight wobble, and I can lean on it pretty hard without it going down. It's a little tricky sometimes to get the wrench-key into the right spot for adjusting the tension, and every person will prefer something a little different - but once you get the hang of it it's a no brainer. Installation itself was easy and instructions were clear. The only difficulty was lifting my Cintiq onto the arm once it's all assembled, because the dumb thing is so darn heavy it would have been nice to have a second pair of hands... but that's not the arm's fault!Ergotron is the standard in the entertainment/arts industry for a reason. I'm an artist, so aesthetics matter, and it has to function all day long every day.  I COULD NOT be more pleased. I'm an extremely tactile and picky person I got the polished aluminum one and I have to say, it's actually beautiful. It doesn't have that ""ergonomic tech"" look that a lot of other ""ergo"" products have, which I think is pretty tacky and wanna-be futuristic. This thing though... this is a beautiful and sturdy piece of engineering and it performs it's function to perfection. THANK YOU ERGOTRON.My desk is 30"" deep and it reaches well beyond the edge from the back, but I have it mounted to one side and it works just fine there too. This is such a massive improvement over the piece of crap stand that the last few models of Cintiqs have come with (the one that only has two positions to choose from, is difficult to adjust, and weighs a freaking ton), it's just night and day.It's rare that I am so dang chuffed over a purchase that I feel COMPELLED to review it, but this one dear god was completely worth it. Improved my workspace 1000% times over and I'm pleased every time I see it and grateful every time I use it!  What a spectacular piece of equipment!!!!",2

UPDATED REVIEW:I purchased the Ergotron HX 6 months ago and discovered that the tilter lacked the lift strength to hold up the monitor. I opened a ticket with their support team, and a few months later they worked with me on getting a replacement tilter. It works great! The new tilter is plenty strong for my particularly heavy monitor.They also fixed an issue with the instructions, where the instructions didn't tell you which way to tighten a particular screw to increase/decrease tilter strength. So, kudos to them.I've been very impressed by the level of the support from Ergotron here. They constantly kept in touch with me about my issue. I am definitely a Ergotron fan at this point.I will say that my original review's criticism of the mounting process is STILL TRUE. That is one area Ergotron should iterate on.Anyway, if you're looking for a great heavy duty monitor arm, you've found it!I'll keep the old review here for posterity.OLD REVIEW:Titled: ""It doesn't hold up""The HX lacks the tilt lift strength to hold up up my monitor, an Odyssey G9, which is 14 Kg and well within specifications. It is essentially stuck in a 5 degree downward angle, unless I prop it up.Other issues:- The instructions don't say which way to turn the included T-wrench to increase or decrease the tilt lift strength! Incredible. (This is noted on all the other adjustments in the instructions, besides this one.) You'll either have to look up external resources to find out, or just experiment (possibly in vain, like me!)- This was the most painful mounting of my life. Like other mount systems, you install an adapter on the back of your monitor, and then you mount your adapter-plus-monitor onto the stand. Usually the port to mount the adapter has an ergonomic shape which makes mounting a breeze. But not this one. The target port on the stand is very small and hard to mount onto. Plus you'll either need to mount the monitor holding it at a 70 degree angle, or you'll have to press down on the spring mechanism to hold it down while mounting it. This requires a lot of hands, and difficult to do solo, especially while holding a 14kg monitor.It took me two hours to assemble and mount my monitor, and then it doesn't even hold up the monitor.I opened up a chat with support, which to their credit they answered up right away. However, they weren't able to commit right there to sending me a new replacement adapter (it's labeled ""A1"" in the instructions). They said they'll talk to their tech team and mail me back. If they send me a nice replacement I may adjust my review. Otherwise I'll just send the whole thing back to amazon and try again with a different mount.",1

Further, there's very little wiggle and it keeps its position very well. So kudos, it does the main job well.But... the price is exorbitant. A basic monitor arm costs literally one tenth the price, there's absolutely no way this requires ten times the materials or engineering, you are definitely paying for both the brand name and the fact that no one else (that I know of) makes a stand with this weight capacity. Supply and demand, I guess, but the stand that comes with the G9 is so excellent I really question if I made the right choice.Assembly is pretty straightforward, though if you have the G9 you will definitely want a second pair of hands actually lift it onto the mount.Adjustment in all directions works well enough but it really wants to move in some ways more than others. For example, it rotates (the one adjustment I never want to make) far too easily so I'm always leveling back out after moving it. And of the three main pivots, the middle one moves much more easily than the other two so actually moving it backwards and forwards it is a matter of swinging it side to side until you can get each pivot to move the way you want. It takes a good 30-60 seconds of wiggling just to push it back. Maybe this is unavoidable due to the monitor weight, but don't think this is something you can just adjust on a whim.Also, the depth adjustment is surprisingly short. I measured a measly 18cm of range - they advertise more, but that requires pushing it off to one side which isn't going to be a good option for most people. This is partly because the main pivot where it meets the desk is limited to 180 degrees from left to right, not ~360 as you might expect. It's puzzling because you can rotate it the full 360 by removing the set screw and it seems to operate just fine, but obviously that's risky to do without knowing why they limited it in the first place. If someone from Ergotron reads this, I'd love to know why it's limited and how dangerous it is to use without the screw.Finally, the cable management is, as always from Ergotron, hugely disappointing. I can't believe they still don't make this a priority. There's ways they route cables: first, two little velcro strips that are ugly, hard to close neatly, and tend to come out and are a huge headache to get back in. Worse, they don't even hide the cables! It's the cheapest, laziest solution imaginable. The other is a cavity on the rear arm that's covered by a plastic sheath. This at least looks nice once they're tucked in, though doing so is a pain and getting the plastic part on an off is rather tricky.

I used it on a Dell 42.5"" UltraSharp U4323QE Hub monitor with built-in VESA holes. Screws and posts for many monitors are supplied, but I recommend this combination. The additional USB ports are easily accessed with this monitor arm.When installing this, my former HP 42.5 UHD Z43 monitor detached from its mount when I turned it over and dropped on the Ergotron, shattering the screen and not being covered by the extended warranty. (I am a bonehead). The Z43 required an optional external mount for VESA, which I didn't realize before I bought the monitor. Smashing the screen saved me the hassle of getting the optional add-on VESA mount from HP (and it would have been a hassle). I purchased this monitor arm because I wanted more than the HP mount, although the monitor was good. The HP monitor is a few hundred cheaper and a good one, but if you get that, take a very close look at the VESA situation, the stand on the HP I bought was not adequate for the size of the monitor. The monitor was a couple of years old so they might have corrected this, but caveat emptor. This is so much better than the shaky, poorly adjusting HP stand that I feel better about stupidly shattering the HP. Also, this monitor bolts directly onto the arm via VESA holes the HP didn't have. The resolution on the HP might have been better, but the Dell is easier to operate. It's a shame HP made a pretty good monitor and then skrimped on the stuff that makes it work ergonomically.",1

The arm is rated for just under 40 pounds and the Cintiq is just under 20lbs, so the arm supports the screen well. The arm is stiff enough that the screen doesn't move or jiggle noticeably at all – I expected to have to keep the Cintiq resting on the desktop, but found I'm able to keep it floating and work on it without any problem whatsoever.There is limited mobility compared to other Ergotron arms, but I valued stiffness above mobility. The arm also doesn't have much reach. This is fine for most non-Cintiq monitors, but if you want the screen to be near the front of the desk or able to drop over the edge like the stock stand, you'll need to use the alternate clamping method to bring the screen forward (the arm allows two clamping methods). This requires drilling a 5/16 or 3/8"" hole in your desk, so if your desk is precious and deep be aware that you might not be able to pull the screen forward much. You can find precise drawings with dimensions on their website.The materials and build quality are impressive. I ordered the aluminum finish, but there is still a bit of white plastic, which looks nice. The milling is precise, the finish is great and the castings are impressive. There's even a bronze bushing for the rotating joint in the base – that's the kind of touch that I personally love.All in all, I couldn't be happier – at about half the cost of a Wacom Ergo stand, this is much lighter, more stylish, and much more functional in my opinion. For example, if I want to work standing up, this arm allows for that. Or if I'm drawing with my eye close to the screen but I don't want to bend over, I can make the screen near-horizontal and lift it to my eyes. This eases my neck, and the screen is still plenty steady to work on. It's the perfect solution for the Cintiq 27QHD in my opinion.",2

Perez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","A curved monitor, despite its listed weight of 25.6lbs / 11.61kg, may feel heavier due to the distribution of weight not being directly over the stand. The curvature of these monitors applies additional force to the mounting head, necessitating a sturdier tilting mechanism. To illustrate, holding a 5 lb. weight close to your chest feels lighter than holding it straight out, even though the weight remains the same. Similarly, the force exerted by the screen on the mount makes it feel significantly heavier at the mounting point.After experimenting with several monitor arms supposedly capable of supporting a Samsung 49"" curved monitor, the truth emerged: their tilting heads would gradually wear out, causing the monitor to droop, or in my case, dangerously tip forward, requiring a swift rescue intervention (fortunately, I was present when it happened).Enter this premium monitor arm, engineered with these extra forces in mind. It stands rock-solid, alleviating all my concerns.  Considering the cost of the monitor, this investment is worth it!",1

Speaking of assembly the instructions are a joke and don’t accurately show in the images how you actually connect the stand to the VESA mount and I nearly broke my computer trying to until I finally checked out YouTube.  My final complaint would be that one of the arms had some minor scruffs which isn’t the end of the world but for such an expensive product you would expect it to spotless.,-2

The fact that it supports a slightly heavier monitor than most arms doesn't warrant the price being 3x higher.  The other bigger issue to me is that the lower part of the arm is limited to 180 degree rotation and can't be installed so that the arm at 90 degrees goes away from you instead of towards you.  As a result, the monitor (especially the Samsung Neo G9) ends up being way too close to your face. I ended up installing the lower arm so that it can swing towards the back of the desk, but this also means it's not locked in with the screw.",-2

Cardenas,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021","I bought this to use with a 24'' Cintiq pro because the wobble I was getting with my ergotron LX was so bad. While this arm definitely fixed the wobbling issue it's just too tall and too short! The angle it holds the Cintiq at makes it so you have to draw with your elbow bent which is ergonomically terrible if you're working for long hours. It's also very short, so if you have a desk that is 24'' in depth or more then you will find it impossible to get it into the center of your desk. Because of it's height I set my standing desk overly low to allow myself to draw with a better elbow angle, but even with it squishing my thighs the arm is still just TOO tall to draw completely comfortably.I really cannot recommend this arm unless you're only using it for a heavy monitor that will remain static/won't be interacted with.",-2

I have tried a few arms that couldn't hold the G9 firmly and had issues with tilting and other adjustments. However, with this arm, you can easily tilt, move it side to side, up and down, and rotate it without any problems. The build quality is excellent, and it's truly amazing.The only drawback of this monitor arm is its pricing. It is ridiculously expensive, which is why I'm giving it a 3-star rating. If it were priced at half the current amount, I would definitely rate it 5 stars.One thing to note is that the installation instructions provided in the package, especially for the HD Pivot and how to adjust it with the G9, are not very clear. I recommend searching online and watching the video on their website for proper adjustment guidance.In conclusion, my recommendation is to either go for this monitor arm or stick with the original stand if you don't want to spend a significant amount of money",0

Man muss leider aber auch sagen, dass der Arm mehr Platz wegnimmt als ich anfangs erwartet habe und „ausgestreckt“ wackeliger als der Standard Bildschirmfuss ist. Der Sichtabstand zum normalen Fuß (beim CRG9 von Samsung) verringert sich bei mir um 3-5cm.Es gibt aber auch ein ganz großes ABER:Der Arm eignet sich nur für die direkte Platzierung auf dem Arbeitsplatz, zu Höhenverstellen neigen und vor- sowie zurückziehen.Ich habe leider nur Platz für einen 120x70cm Schreibtisch und wollte den Monitor leicht versetzt platzieren, damit ich daneben meinen Laptop aufklappen kann. Das drehen am Kopf des Monitorarms ist hier leider limitiert (Kopf stößt an den Arm) und die gewünschte Funktion nicht möglich. Das drehen wäre nur möglich, wenn man den Monitor nach vorne zieht oder den obersten Teil des Armes dreht, dann verringert sich der Sichtabstand aber erheblich (auf wenige cm).Die dezentrale Positionierung ist mit dem klassischen Tischfuß wesentlich leichter, der Sichtabstand deutlich größer. Auch wenn es schick aussah, war der Platzgewinn nicht nennenswert und durch die beschränkte Funktionalität habe ich alles wieder zurück gebaut und sende den Arm zurück.",-1

Further, there's very little wiggle and it keeps its position very well. So kudos, it does the main job well.But... the price is exorbitant. A basic monitor arm costs literally one tenth the price, there's absolutely no way this requires ten times the materials or engineering, you are definitely paying for both the brand name and the fact that no one else (that I know of) makes a stand with this weight capacity. Supply and demand, I guess, but the stand that comes with the G9 is so excellent I really question if I made the right choice.Assembly is pretty straightforward, though if you have the G9 you will definitely want a second pair of hands actually lift it onto the mount.Adjustment in all directions works well enough but it really wants to move in some ways more than others. For example, it rotates (the one adjustment I never want to make) far too easily so I'm always leveling back out after moving it. And of the three main pivots, the middle one moves much more easily than the other two so actually moving it backwards and forwards it is a matter of swinging it side to side until you can get each pivot to move the way you want. It takes a good 30-60 seconds of wiggling just to push it back. Maybe this is unavoidable due to the monitor weight, but don't think this is something you can just adjust on a whim.Also, the depth adjustment is surprisingly short. I measured a measly 18cm of range - they advertise more, but that requires pushing it off to one side which isn't going to be a good option for most people. This is partly because the main pivot where it meets the desk is limited to 180 degrees from left to right, not ~360 as you might expect. It's puzzling because you can rotate it the full 360 by removing the set screw and it seems to operate just fine, but obviously that's risky to do without knowing why they limited it in the first place. If someone from Ergotron reads this, I'd love to know why it's limited and how dangerous it is to use without the screw.Finally, the cable management is, as always from Ergotron, hugely disappointing. I can't believe they still don't make this a priority. There's ways they route cables: first, two little velcro strips that are ugly, hard to close neatly, and tend to come out and are a huge headache to get back in. Worse, they don't even hide the cables! It's the cheapest, laziest solution imaginable. The other is a cavity on the rear arm that's covered by a plastic sheath. This at least looks nice once they're tucked in, though doing so is a pain and getting the plastic part on an off is rather tricky. I don't exaggerate when I say I've bought sub-$50 monitor arms with more elegant and thoughtful cable management solutions. Figure it out, Ergotron! I'm paying you way too much for this malarky!",0

It has full range of motion and it's really easy to install. My only gripe with it is that it doesn't work well with monitors that don't weigh a lot. If the monitor is too light, It likes to tilt up and no matter how much you adjust the tension, It doesn't help. It's definitely meant for heavier displays. For any lighter display I would recommend either the LX or the new NX (which is the one I currently use). I still recommend the HX and think it's a fantastic product, Even if it is a really expensive arm.",1

It feels super secure and the quality is fantastic (compared to an older mount I had that was $100). However, I can't get the stand to bend past the desk so I can move my screen further away from my face. My older mount allowed me to do this and I just assumed this would be the same. Sadly, I was wrong but I guess that's on my part for not checking first. The spring that holds the head of the monitor up is constantly moving upwards, regardless of how many times I keep adjusting it to angle downwards. I'm hoping I'll eventually be able to finesse it to the angle I need. I'd definitely recommend this arm if youre looking for something sturdy and dependable.

It securely holds up my Odyssey Neo G9, which I can now manipulate with ease. The arm looks good and articulates well even with a heavy load, but I do have some complaints (in order of how annoying they are):First, the two sections of the part that attaches to the monitor were misaligned when the 0° lock screw hole was drilled, which means if I want to force the monitor not to tilt by screwing in the 0° lock, it would be stuck tilted. Luckily even without the screw it's pretty secure, so I just left it out. If not, I would have returned the arm. Pictures show the hole lined up but the two pieces of the mount being completely unaligned.Second, the instructions (as far as I could see) don't mention that the small screws at the base of each segment are what restrict the pivot of the arm. The booklet shows both that the monitor arm can move >180°, but also that it's restricted to 180°. I had to go to the reviews here to see someone mention that it was possible and I made the connection, which let me adjust things properly.Third, you can't adjust the strength of the up and down motion without pulling the monitor all the way up to access the bolt. It's only a minor inconvenience, though.Despite these problems, I am happy with the arm overall!",1

This is a pretty necessary feature when use the clamp mount with the arm, due to the weight of the monitors it's designed for. However, if you are using the supplied grommet mount through a hole in your desktop, as I am; then this restriction in rotation means your monitor will always be forward of it's mounting point. This ultimately takes up a lot of room on your desk if you use this Ergotron HX arm in any configuration other than the desk clamp configuration.Second, the cord management is truly awful. Poetically, it is equally as terrible as the cord management tunnel on the factory CRG9 stand. I ultimately had to custom make cables to get my bare minimum (1x DP, AC power, USB-B hub cable, and 2x USB outs) to work with the system. Come on Ergotron, do better.With those complaints out of the way, this is a luxury vehicle of a monitor arm. Albeit, built like a Tesla Model S and not like a Taycan Turbo.",-1

They were terrible. And when I had it on the table it was really difficult to get my monitor on it. I really am not sure if you're supposed to install it on the monitor first? But if you do that then you still have to juggle it to get it affixed to your desktop. Anyways. I have a 49"" chg90 and the fact that it is installed and keeps my monitor off my desk is worth 5 stars. But I also am not able to really move the monitor around much. It seems that it's too heavy to really lift up high and it kinda just lowers to the same height so I'm stuck with it at the height it's at. Which is a bummer. I thought I'd be able to swivel it all over, but I cannot. I am also sort of afraid to do it, because even though this thing is heavy duty feeling, I still feel like my monitor could just break off. nonetheless, i can't imagine there is a better arm out there. and this one came in white to match my pc. bc i'm one of those basic b's with all white pc and accessories. werd.",0

So far so good! The arm handles the weight well, even at maximum extension.The HX is less maneuverable than the LX, as you might expect from a much heavier arm designed for much heavier loads. The HX is significantly more stable than the LX though - there's very little flex in any part of the arm, so the monitor doesn't wobble much when you poke it.On the lowest joint of the arm there's a little screw. If you screw it in like the instructions say, it limits the rotation of the first arm section to 180 degrees. This is great if your desk is against a wall, but mine is not. If you loosen that screw you get the full 360-degree rotation with no apparent loss of stability.Make sure you have a sturdy desk. The surface area of the clamp is great, but at full extension there's still a huge amount of force trying to rip your desk apart. Before mounting your monitor, push down on the arm at full extension until it starts to move and observe the reaction of your desk. That's approximately how much force your desk will have to endure with the monitor attached.I chose the Ergotron HX over the Humanscale M8 and Locktek's heavy duty arm, and so far I think I made the right choice. It looks and feels premium and sturdy, and comes with good instructions and labeled parts/tools.Pros:- Handles the 40"" Seiki with ease- Stable, no wobble- Easy to installCons:- Was covered in fingerprints within minutes (aluminum-trimmed model)- The two lowest joints (the one at the desk and the next one up) move sluggishly",1

Having made the decision recently to switch to the LG CX 48 OLED, I decided it was time to finally get a monitor arm that won't droop/sag under the weight of a larger display.After doing some light research, it turns out the Ergotron HX is really one of the only solutions, if you're looking for a load capacity of more than 40lbs... And so I picked it up.Construction is solid, as you would expect from Ergotron. Assembly is straight forward, instructions are simple and easy to follow. Note, you may want to adjust the spring tension on the arm section with the VESA plate as it is a bit of a pain to adjust afterwards as I learned. For the CX 48, I had to also purchase a VESA adapter as the included brackets only support up to 200x200 mounting.Overall very impressed by the arm. It's very smooth and fluid to move around, and it has shown no signs of drooping (after adjusting the spring tension). The only negative, and it's a big one, is the price. If you don't need this much load capacity, the next best option (and one I would recommend) is the Locktek D7L (up to 33lbs) at over $100 less...",1

However, this thing only gives you a 180-degree rotation from the bottom side. Meaning that, if you want to push your monitor away from you, you will not be able to do that!! Unless you loosen the bottom screw (as seen in the picture) to force the mount to move from 180 to 360, which I think is not advised by the manual (I think it might cause some problems to the mount, though for me I wouldn't mind taking the risk .. otherwise my monitor would be very close to my face).This would've been a straightforward 5-star review if it wasn't because of that limit with the rotation. This is an issue you wouldn't think you might see in a mount with this price tag!",0

I purchased two, and well, it holds the monitor horizontally, but it can not go vertical. I needed that perk too. It seems this arm was made for this monitor, so maybe I am doing something incorrectly.  Make sure you have a quality desk before making this purchase. I purchased a new desk for my wife, which would not have held this for long. I had to return one. I hope this helps.Cheers!",0

It wasn't at all difficult to assemble/install, though the parts are substantially heavier than they look, the problem was when it came to attach the mount to the monitor.  The bracket included with the arm was *way* too big to fit in the space left from removing the Samsung monitor stand.Five stars for customer support, who quickly and patiently figured out what the problem was and let me know there was another adapter required to bridge between Samsung's non-standard mounting to the standard VESA mounting holes, that should have been included with the monitor.  It was, though I'd set it aside thinking it was a wall-mount when unboxing the monitor.  Four stars for the assembly instructions, where the stand is sold specifically for the G9 it would've been better if the instructions called out the need for that adapter.  With that sorted, the rest of the assembly was straightforward.  I assembled it solo, but it was a bit precarious getting the large heavy display in place--definitely a job for two people.At first I was disappointed as the mount immediately tilted down under the monitor's weight, and the arm sunk until the monitor was touching the desk.  It took a lot of turns to tighten up the resistance screws (called out in the instructions) to hold the monitor in position, but once done it has been rock-solid.  With the Samsung stand, as I typed the monitor would jiggle side-to-side (I learned to type on a manual typewriter so do use a lot of force on the mechanical keyboard, so there is a lot of vibration transferred to the desk)--with this mount there's almost none.",1

I bought it as soon as I found out we'd be working from home for a while, in an effort to finally upgrade my home setup. After I bought it I mentioned it to a friend, and she said ""YES!!! I HAVE THE SAME ONE AND I LOVE IT!!"" I've only had it for a couple of months, but my friend has had hers for years and it's still going strong.I have an enormous Cintiq - 24HD Touch. I was warned that if the weight of the screen to be supported is too close to the weight limit, it probably won't work well, and this was literally the only arm I could find that was rated to support my monster! Not only does it hold the weight of my Cintiq beautifully, the motion is smooth and effortless, only a very slight wobble, and I can lean on it pretty hard without it going down. It's a little tricky sometimes to get the wrench-key into the right spot for adjusting the tension, and every person will prefer something a little different - but once you get the hang of it it's a no brainer. Installation itself was easy and instructions were clear. The only difficulty was lifting my Cintiq onto the arm once it's all assembled, because the dumb thing is so darn heavy it would have been nice to have a second pair of hands... but that's not the arm's fault!Ergotron is the standard in the entertainment/arts industry for a reason. I'm an artist, so aesthetics matter, and it has to function all day long every day.  I COULD NOT be more pleased. I'm an extremely tactile and picky person I got the polished aluminum one and I have to say, it's actually beautiful. It doesn't have that ""ergonomic tech"" look that a lot of other ""ergo"" products have, which I think is pretty tacky and wanna-be futuristic. This thing though... this is a beautiful and sturdy piece of engineering and it performs it's function to perfection. THANK YOU ERGOTRON.My desk is 30"" deep and it reaches well beyond the edge from the back, but I have it mounted to one side and it works just fine there too. This is such a massive improvement over the piece of crap stand that the last few models of Cintiqs have come with (the one that only has two positions to choose from, is difficult to adjust, and weighs a freaking ton), it's just night and day.It's rare that I am so dang chuffed over a purchase that I feel COMPELLED to review it, but this one dear god was completely worth it. Improved my workspace 1000% times over and I'm pleased every time I see it and grateful every time I use it!  What a spectacular piece of equipment!!!!",2

UPDATED REVIEW:I purchased the Ergotron HX 6 months ago and discovered that the tilter lacked the lift strength to hold up the monitor. I opened a ticket with their support team, and a few months later they worked with me on getting a replacement tilter. It works great! The new tilter is plenty strong for my particularly heavy monitor.They also fixed an issue with the instructions, where the instructions didn't tell you which way to tighten a particular screw to increase/decrease tilter strength. So, kudos to them.I've been very impressed by the level of the support from Ergotron here. They constantly kept in touch with me about my issue. I am definitely a Ergotron fan at this point.I will say that my original review's criticism of the mounting process is STILL TRUE. That is one area Ergotron should iterate on.Anyway, if you're looking for a great heavy duty monitor arm, you've found it!I'll keep the old review here for posterity.OLD REVIEW:Titled: ""It doesn't hold up""The HX lacks the tilt lift strength to hold up up my monitor, an Odyssey G9, which is 14 Kg and well within specifications. It is essentially stuck in a 5 degree downward angle, unless I prop it up.Other issues:- The instructions don't say which way to turn the included T-wrench to increase or decrease the tilt lift strength! Incredible. (This is noted on all the other adjustments in the instructions, besides this one.) You'll either have to look up external resources to find out, or just experiment (possibly in vain, like me!)- This was the most painful mounting of my life. Like other mount systems, you install an adapter on the back of your monitor, and then you mount your adapter-plus-monitor onto the stand. Usually the port to mount the adapter has an ergonomic shape which makes mounting a breeze. But not this one. The target port on the stand is very small and hard to mount onto. Plus you'll either need to mount the monitor holding it at a 70 degree angle, or you'll have to press down on the spring mechanism to hold it down while mounting it. This requires a lot of hands, and difficult to do solo, especially while holding a 14kg monitor.It took me two hours to assemble and mount my monitor, and then it doesn't even hold up the monitor.I opened up a chat with support, which to their credit they answered up right away. However, they weren't able to commit right there to sending me a new replacement adapter (it's labeled ""A1"" in the instructions). They said they'll talk to their tech team and mail me back. If they send me a nice replacement I may adjust my review. Otherwise I'll just send the whole thing back to amazon and try again with a different mount.",1

I used it on a Dell 42.5"" UltraSharp U4323QE Hub monitor with built-in VESA holes. Screws and posts for many monitors are supplied, but I recommend this combination. The additional USB ports are easily accessed with this monitor arm.When installing this, my former HP 42.5 UHD Z43 monitor detached from its mount when I turned it over and dropped on the Ergotron, shattering the screen and not being covered by the extended warranty. (I am a bonehead). The Z43 required an optional external mount for VESA, which I didn't realize before I bought the monitor. Smashing the screen saved me the hassle of getting the optional add-on VESA mount from HP (and it would have been a hassle). I purchased this monitor arm because I wanted more than the HP mount, although the monitor was good. The HP monitor is a few hundred cheaper and a good one, but if you get that, take a very close look at the VESA situation, the stand on the HP I bought was not adequate for the size of the monitor. The monitor was a couple of years old so they might have corrected this, but caveat emptor. This is so much better than the shaky, poorly adjusting HP stand that I feel better about stupidly shattering the HP. Also, this monitor bolts directly onto the arm via VESA holes the HP didn't have. The resolution on the HP might have been better, but the Dell is easier to operate. It's a shame HP made a pretty good monitor and then skrimped on the stuff that makes it work ergonomically.",1

The arm is rated for just under 40 pounds and the Cintiq is just under 20lbs, so the arm supports the screen well. The arm is stiff enough that the screen doesn't move or jiggle noticeably at all – I expected to have to keep the Cintiq resting on the desktop, but found I'm able to keep it floating and work on it without any problem whatsoever.There is limited mobility compared to other Ergotron arms, but I valued stiffness above mobility. The arm also doesn't have much reach. This is fine for most non-Cintiq monitors, but if you want the screen to be near the front of the desk or able to drop over the edge like the stock stand, you'll need to use the alternate clamping method to bring the screen forward (the arm allows two clamping methods). This requires drilling a 5/16 or 3/8"" hole in your desk, so if your desk is precious and deep be aware that you might not be able to pull the screen forward much. You can find precise drawings with dimensions on their website.The materials and build quality are impressive. I ordered the aluminum finish, but there is still a bit of white plastic, which looks nice. The milling is precise, the finish is great and the castings are impressive. There's even a bronze bushing for the rotating joint in the base – that's the kind of touch that I personally love.All in all, I couldn't be happier – at about half the cost of a Wacom Ergo stand, this is much lighter, more stylish, and much more functional in my opinion. For example, if I want to work standing up, this arm allows for that. Or if I'm drawing with my eye close to the screen but I don't want to bend over, I can make the screen near-horizontal and lift it to my eyes. This eases my neck, and the screen is still plenty steady to work on. It's the perfect solution for the Cintiq 27QHD in my opinion.",2

Perez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","A curved monitor, despite its listed weight of 25.6lbs / 11.61kg, may feel heavier due to the distribution of weight not being directly over the stand. The curvature of these monitors applies additional force to the mounting head, necessitating a sturdier tilting mechanism. To illustrate, holding a 5 lb. weight close to your chest feels lighter than holding it straight out, even though the weight remains the same. Similarly, the force exerted by the screen on the mount makes it feel significantly heavier at the mounting point.After experimenting with several monitor arms supposedly capable of supporting a Samsung 49"" curved monitor, the truth emerged: their tilting heads would gradually wear out, causing the monitor to droop, or in my case, dangerously tip forward, requiring a swift rescue intervention (fortunately, I was present when it happened).Enter this premium monitor arm, engineered with these extra forces in mind. It stands rock-solid, alleviating all my concerns.  Considering the cost of the monitor, this investment is worth it!",1

The install and removal were nothing short of a nightmare. I did not want to go through that experience again, so I decided to spend quite a bit more for the mount that came highly recommended. As soon as you pick this thing up, you can feel the difference in quality. The weight, mounting pieces, and the pivot made me feel like I wouldn't have anything to worry about trusting it with my monitor.Install was a bit tricky, but not because of the mount, but the desk I was using. It was narrow and the top is very thin. I originally tried drilling a hole due to my desk having a bar blocking the place where the clamp goes, but it stuck way too far out. I decided to buy a 2x4, cut it to size and making a channel that goes over the bar.  This did the trick and created a great platform to clamp onto. The rest of the process was cake. The arm needed an adjustment to support the weight but the pivot, the pivot was perfect right out the box. Raising and lowering the monitor kept it level and never once did it drop. I wish this was a little cheaper but you get what you pay for.My only gripes would be with cable management and not being able to turn the arm more than 90 degrees left or right from the center position. This is just me nitpicking though because there really isn't much else to complain about.",1

Sherman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022","This monitor arm is extremely well made, durable and a lot more heavy then I thought it would be.  So, overall the construction of the arm and it's design is very well made, heavy solid materials.  It comes shipped in a great packaging, it's nice to see care in how much care went into packing.  The assembly is relatively easy with just 3 parts that connect with a few screws to tighten.  I'm using this arm with an LG 38"" Ultra Wide monitor that I believe is about 15lbs in weight and it can easily move around without struggle on the arm.If you have a lighter monitor or a smaller sized one, you may have difficulty with the arm keeping a monitor in a low position.  If the monitor is light weight < 12-13lbs it may want to lift up on it's own due to the heavy spring action.  I had a smaller monitor on it while waiting for my ultra-wide and it was kind of comical.  I added weight to the monitor to keep it down a bit.It supports VESA 100x100 and 200x200 on the mounting bracket.  I feel like this is a good standard for newer monitors.  The mount is sturdy and supports a really good range of movement tilting up and down as well as a full rotation on it's side.  The arm movement is really reasonable in it's range of movement.  I'm even able to drop my monitor down a bit lower than the clamp.The arm assembly also includes options to mount the arm with a desk clamp, or through a drilled hole.  It has good options for mounting the arm as needed.I'm really satisfied with this purchase and can see this arm lasting a really long time - probably much longer than my new monitor.  I highly recommend getting it.",2

Technically, it does not weigh *that* much (~26 lbs without stand), so I figured I'd give a Vivo premium a try.Although that arm claimed to support 30+ lbs and 49"" monitors, it was barely useable. You couldn't make any real adjustments and the arm barely held the monitor up. It was floppy with slop everywhere.I purchased this Ergotron to replace it. The second I opened the box and started pulling parts out, the difference was night and day. Each Ergotron part feels solid. They are weighty and appear well designed.The most important part, to me, is the tilt mechanism. It uses a spring mechanism which is far superior to competitors rubber bushing tensioners. It handles the 49"" Neo G9 with ease: it will hold it steady while also allowing easy direction of tilt.Assembly was remarkably easy...easier than competitors. The primary difference is the way the monitor mounts to the arm. Most competitors use a plate that slides into a groove and ""locks"" in place with a detent. This introduces flex which makes it feel less secure and makes it harder to adjust the monitor properly.In contrast, the Ergotron uses a vastly superior design with a solid metal connector that slots *and then bolts* together. It is both easy to connect (even with one person) and sturdier than the other design.I was hesitant to spend so much on a monitor arm, but it is well worth the 250% price premium here. While I think for sub 34"" monitors the competitors can offer a good value,  for large monitors, this can't be beat.",2

Greenlee,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","I love everything about this monitor other than one thing, the middle swivel (lateral) tension is too much. It doesn't move as smoothly as the videos. There is no documentation or video to describe how (if at all) this tension can be reduced. When I push the monitor back I have to manually bend that section of arm with some effort and correct total pose of arm at the other joints to get the look/ shape I want. Not sure if there's a way around this. There is one screw that keeps that joint in place, I'll try again to loosen that, but pretty sure it didn't work when I assembled, and is meant to keep that joint safely in place. Using it for G9 49"". Also there's a miniscule gap here which hurts my OCD but doesn't seem to affect anything.",1

It holds my 39"" monitor solidly, with no hint of weakness. But:1. The screen can't be centered if the mount is centered, unless you have the mount going directly forward (which you probably don't want since that would mean the screen is way too close to your face). The top of the monitor arm is longer than the bottom, so you need to place the mount a bit to one side if you want the screen to be centered. This means the grommet mount option doesn't work very well, since most grommets are centered.2. The arm can't be swung to the back. This doesn't matter if your desk is up against a wall, but if your desk is mounted in the middle of the room you might wish that you could swing the monitor arm to the back so your screen can be further away from you. I can sort of understand why it's like this because it would probably be difficult to allow this safely - if the monitor could swing way behind the desk it might create a tipping hazard.3. The wire-concealing solution could be cleaner. Especially with the grommet-mount option, it'd be nice to able to run wires down through the base and through the grommet, but it doesn't allow this. But it's basically a standard wire-concealing setup, so it's fine.But these grievances are relatively minor. Overall it's a great product and I'm very happy with my purchase.",1

I went with a Youtube video install from an owner since I'm more visual than parsing written instructions.My main issue: The adapter that comes with it (sort of like a metal cup that is held onto the back hole of the GP monitor with 4 small screws to the main plate) has a notch that slides under the plastic notch of the monitor. This is not very secure and slides out so all the weight of the system is on those 4 smaller screws.When I did the install I saw that the 2 of the 4 hand tightening screws on the main plate (larger, separate on the exterior plate from the 4 smaller interior screws) were angling off the plate worryingly and I mistakenly thought it was coming off so I hastily popped the monitor back off and broke the brass interior slot ring.Looking at other Youtube install videos it seems that is a known factor and owners are ok with that stress on the 4 interior screws if the plate is not notch perfect. *shrug*.So I emailed Ergotron to see if I can get a replacement part for the arm to try again. To my delight, their customer service replied quickly and shipped UPS the part for free. Major kudos.CONCLUSION: Going to go at it again when the part comes in. I think it'll be fine now even though the back plate skewing a little bit is head scratching. 4 Stars for the product. 5 stars for Customer Service.I might come back to this review down the road after a year for an update of how it all went.",1

After spending that much for a monitor, I wanted to make sure the monitor arm would work and work well. This arm is exactly as the title of this review. I have zero fears that the arm will fail. The arm also frees up A LOT of desk surface area. Easier to assemble with a second person.----------------------------- There are SEVERAL options for monitor mounting. The wall mount plate that came with the monitor itself fit the plate on the arm perfectly; you will have attaching hardware left over.-- All tools are included in the box, but you will probably want a Philips Head screwdriver (for attaching the monitor itself to the arm).-- Get someone to assist you with assembly; an extra set of hands is helpful for supporting the weight of the arm and monitor while attaching it to the desk surface.-- Lay your monitor face down, preferably on the curved styrofoam surface of the packing material.-- FIgure out which one of the mounting options will work for your monitor; attach the monitor to the support with screws. (Four Philips Head screws are what attached the monitor to the original base and are what I used to attach the monitor to the arm.)-- Assemble the arm separate from the monitor. Figure out which way the ""bend"" will go. If you look at the image I provided, you can see that you don't want to center the attachment point if you plan to push the monitor back on the desk.-- Attach the arm to the monitor. This is where you will want help. Have your assistant hold the arm up while you secure the monitor to the arm.-- With one person holding the monitor, attach the arm to the desk.-- Position your monitor.---------------------------One note: I do believe that your monitor must be heavy enough (25 lbs +) in order to keep tension on the arm and prevent it from rising. I will update if anything changes, but as of this review, I couldn't be happier.",2

There is a set screw you need to back off at the base. It's very easy to do and the only reason it exists is to prevent it from being knocked into a wall if the desk is flush.The other complaint I see is the fact the monitor rotates from landscape to portrait too easily.  While this is true, there is a set screw that can be placed to prevent it from rotating in that way at all, which I'm assuming is 99% of people's preference, strange it isn't installed by default.2) The quality of this thing is astounding.  I was truly shocked as I removed it from the packaging.  Is it $400 worth of quality? Hard to say.  I know I'd have purchased it much sooner if it was $250 instead but I can't see how the material and built could be any better. They definitely don't cut corners.3) This was very easy to set up.  You WILL need to remove the monitor to make any adjustments to location or if you don't get the pieces seated properly, and obviously that is a task for 2 people.  It can be a little unnerving but that's just the nature of dealing with something the size of a G9 or similar.I would buy this again, and I wouldn't wait as long as I did the first time.",1

I ordered this arm in polished aluminum and to my surprise was delivered an identical arm in white finish. at the time the white arm was listed as unavailable and was on sale for $54dollars less. After time on hold with Amazon and speaking to a customer service rep, I was told I would receive a credit on my next order at Amazon for $54. The.next order I made was credited $29 dollars so I’m not sure what happened to the rest of the credit totaling $26 dollars is. In fairness, I was given the option of returning the arm for a full refund, but considering I received the arm on a Sunday and needed it for Monday I decided to keep the white arm and not wait for the return and refund process to go through over a couple of weeks.After looking for a monitor arm for months and watching nearly a dozen reviews on YouTube, I bought this arm to mount to a 43 in Monitor to a desk. I certainly could have saved money by going with a less expensive arm from another brand but in the end the quality won out. it is built well and will outlast my monitor by years. Once it was set up, I moved it several times to optimize my desk. Moving it was simple and took only a few minutes. ergotron has videos on their website showing set up which made the setup , much easier than written directions.

Barrett,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","I recently got a 49"" LG monitor. I first bought a Monoprice heavy duty monitor arm as the LG monitor was well under the weight limit. The Monoprice arm was difficult to put together by myself and the tilt was only really a lock in place. I returned it and got this arm. The Ergotron was very easy to put together by myself - all the set screws faced to front and I was easily able to place the 49"" monitor on the arm without contortions. The tilt, in comparison to the Monoprice arm, was fabulous. The spring makes a huge difference and I can actually change the tilt without have to manually lock it in place. I should have gotten this arm initially.",1

I've been using TV's for monitors for quite a while and usually cheeped out on the monitor mount. (What a mistake). Although I've had other arms be able to hold my very large monitors, none could hold them as firmly and without shaking as this. Even with my standing desk extended and my heavy typing I don't get the monitor jiggle I was getting with previous mounts.My only complaint about the product would probably be installation, the spring is so strong on the piece that holds the monitor up, I had to use a very large screwdriver as a prybar to pry it horizontal, (it's pre-tensioned to face the ceiling to keep your monitor from sagging over time).  Maybe there is a better method to install it that just escaped me at the time. Either way after getting it installed, this thing is rock solid.I have the arm, mostly facing sideways, and then the mount turned towards the front, to minimize the amount of desk space the arm is taking up, desk is pushed as close to the wall as possible. Desk is about 6 1/2"" away from the wall, and the monitor is about 3 3/4"" from the back edge of the desk.",1

The product is made out of high quality metal and very sturdy.  It can hold the Samsung Odyssey G9 with ease.  If you have a monitor with a 1000R this is a must have.  This monitor is heavy and curve just adds to it knocking the center of gravity off for the majority of arms. This will cause the tilt to not work correctly or not at all. I've researched a lot of arms before picking this because it was just a lot of money to spend.  Finally I figured since I spent the money on a expensive monitor, I should do the same for the arm.There's nothing like worrying that you may come home and find out that your low quality arm has failed and your monitor is now broken because you wanted to save a few bucks.This arm provides piece of mind knowing that the company has a proven track record with quality made products.  It comes with a 10 year warranty which is outstanding.  Do yourself a favor and get the arm your monitor deserves, you wont regret it.",2

It's definitely on the pricier side but worth every penny. It came with everything I needed to mount my tablet off the side of my desk, and left me with a bunch of hardware should I need to mount to a larger VESA footprint or switch to a grommet mount.Assembly was quick, even after I managed to set everything up only to realize I mounted my tablet upside-down I was done in under an hour. The hold is sturdy and gives me confidence when I draw or move my tablet. And the included cable organizers are a nice touch.The desk clamp is fairly large and goes about 4 inches deep from the edge of the desk. Unfortunately the mounting bracket for my desk's legs leaves only about 2.5 inches of even mount purchase before the edge of my desk. I was able to shim the mount clamps so they hold strong, and even with the clamp bracket extending about an inch off the side of my desk, this thing is plenty sturdy for my liking.In the end, I could have fussed with cheaper mounting arms as I have in the past, but it's hard to put a price on peace of mind when dealing with higher-end monitors.",2

With the curvature, weight, and investment in the G9, I knew that I did not want to risk getting an arm that would not be able to support the monitor. The amount of adjustment on this arm is great for my use, and having the options for both grommet mounting and clamp mounting is a plus that should allow this arm to be useful into the future regardless of what desk and monitor I use. It did take adjusting the height piston a good amount for the arm to hold the monitor where I wanted it, but once I completed the adjustments, it has held true ever since. It was easy to attach to the desk and attach the monitor. Although it may be possible for one person to install the monitor on the arm, I would highly recommend using at least two people to install a large monitor on the arm to assist in setting it in place and adjusting the pistons. The company I work for uses some Ergotron products in the office, therefore I believed it would be worth the investment for my home setup, and I have not been disappointed so far.",1

Parts are very sturdy and precisely machined out of solid metal, with no play or wiggle. It definitely will last, and doesn't feel ""cheap"" at all. I feel that I've gotten what I paid for.+ More than sturdy enough to support its rated weight without wiggling. I have a Cintiq 21UX (around 20 pounds); I can draw or even *lean* on the monitor without it drooping or wiggling. I used the through-hole mounting mechanism, and the entire arm is very rigidly fixed to the desk.+ Good ease of actuation (somehow) even given the rigid/strong support. I'm very impressed with how it's balanced.+ Decent range of actuation. It has all the degrees of freedom I would hope for/expect from a monitor arm. The monitor head can be swiveled, tilted up and down, rotated, or repositioned. One limitation is discussed below.+ Broadly-compatible VESA mount.Downsides:- Style. It's a very functional-looking object, without much attention to visual design or aesthetics. It's not ugly, but it isn't stylish either. The aluminum finish picks up oily fingerprints pretty much right away, and it stops looking clean. A sleeker shape with a burnished nickel or perhaps powder-coated finish might look better.- It ""bottoms out"" a little early. As a Cintiq user, it would be nice for me if the arm actuated just a little bit lower, so I could lean over it like a piece of paper-- this was possible with the factory Cintiq desk stand, but with the arm it rides a little higher. Not a huge deal because I can tilt it forward a little more or raise my chair, but it would be essentially perfect (functionally speaking) if the mount joint could be lowered to rest against the desk surface.

The bracket holding the screen up couldn't tighten to a tension that could hold the screen up and so it would droop, rendering it completely useless. Flashforward to this beast and it's a completely different story. All the build materials are high grade and well machined. The instructions, though simple, I found to be vague at some critical junctures, but I navigated my way through it fine. The one big set back I initially had though is the VESA bracket that connects the monitor to the arm itself. When I intially took it out of the plastic, it was bent in such a way that made it impossible to connect the monitor to the arm and I couldn't seem to muster the strength to move it into place myself. PRO TIP: I did finally figure out that if you, before connecting the bracket to the monitor, first place the bracket into it's fitting on the end of the arm and use that leverage to twist the bracket to a mountable angle, it makes it feasible to assemble (trust me on this one, I'm saving you a huge head ache potentially).All in all, vague instructions not withstanding, for anyone with an ultrawide, this is the arm you've been looking for.",1

The monitor, being heavy, wouldn't stay where I put it, it wanted to drop to the desk.  It wasn't until I did an internet search and found a YouTube video that I realized there is a hidden screw you tighten that makes the arm joint stiffer, so it will hold up the weight of the monitor and doesn't lower after you adjust it and let go.  This screw/adjustment is not mentioned in the instructions.  Major goof up by the company, as it ends up being the most important thing you need to know about using this arm.  I wonder how many of these were returned as ""Doesn't work as advertised"" all because of this one omission...  But now I love this thing, since I figured out how to adjust it!",1

These are the essentials and I'm just happy to have that for holding up this beast of a monitor.Negatives:- Very difficult to adjust the tension on the up-down motion of the monitor. The heavy monitor made it very difficult to get this right, and their system is not easy to fine-tune.- Instructions - great all those languages are available, but not great it combines all of them in one instructions, and really skimps on the wordage. Some things that are difficult (tuning the tension for example) have virtually no instructions. It is a very easy product to do the basic install and you probably won't need instructions, but for tuning (which is essential for heavy monitor) it would be difficult to figure it out without calling tech support.Pluses:It works for a large heavy monitor and only 1 other product like this can do that.

It had a very wobbly stand that it shipped with, and even simple typing on my standing desk would cause the screen to wiggle. It also had limited height adjustment, and I am a tall guy. I saw few different monitor arms out there, but this one just *looked* right, and the reviews were fantastic.When I received it it was *very* heavy, but very sturdy. I was a bit intimidated when I opened it up and there were a pack of like 20 different pieces: L-wrench, screws, extenders, hex, thumb screws... But if you are just connecting it to normal VESA backplate of a monitor you just needed to put in a handful of screws, and then use the LWrench, and the torq to adjust the pins. It went together in 10 minutes, and was rock solid.Don't forget to put the extra pin in back of the VESA plate, that prevents it from being used in landscape, if you want that. I put it completely put together and realized I had forgot to follow that step (user error), so had to take the last piece off again, and install it since I don't need landscape mode.This gave me so much desktop room, I was forced to buy a wireless keyboard and mouse to keep it looking nice.",1

It was worth every penny.  When you inspect all the pieces, you noticed how many solid chunks of CNCed metal there are.  The instructions were easy to follow.  All the screws and other bits were organized into separate, well-labeled pouches, so I didn't have to rummage through a big bag of parts just for the four crews I needed.Once the arm was assembled and attached the monitor to it, it need some adjustments, but it works perfectly for my PG35VQ.One interesting thing I noticed:  The floors in my apartment aren't great.  In the past, with other arms, my monitor would jiggle a bit when someone walked by my desk no matter how stiff I made all the joints.  Not the case with the Ergotron HX.  It's rock solid!",2

Appreciate getting the monitor off the stand sitting on the desk. It frees up space and is easier to manipulate when shifting from sit to stand. Do make sure you still have the wall mount for your monitor as that is what makes the arm compatible with the monitor. Had considered a different, cheaper brand's monitor arm, but reviews mentioned that it eventually loses its lift capacity and began to droop. Given the investment in the larger monitor it made more sense to pay more on the front end for a secure arm. You'll need to decide for yourself if that's important to you.",1

If I was being nitpicky this would be a 4/5, but seeing as how there's really no other manufacturer that readily provides a solution to my problem it really is just the best I can get, from what I've seen.I upgraded from an LG 34UC89G-B 34"" 21:9 to an Alienware AW3423DW 34"" 21:9 and wanted to keep both monitors, with the new one on bottom and old on mounted on top. My old 2 arm mount was not going to be able to support this much weight as my other monitor was just a 27"" 16:9 and it barely held those together. I didn't want to have to screw anything into my wall and I wasn't 100% sure on my desk space so I wanted free moving arms for orienting the monitors before finalizing where I want them to stay.Once I got this I was able to set my monitors up stacked on top of each other. While the bottom one isn't quite sitting as low as it can go, it's not far off. But the top monitor is just about using the mount's maximum capabilities in terms of being able to space these monitors apart while still leaving a tiny bit of room for adjustment. I have been able to pull my top monitor forward and rotate it portrait for documents and such though I have not done the same with the bottom monitor.______________________________________________________Overall actual use after setup:9/10The monitors themselves are not on the extreme end of heavy but they're not light. They both fall within the specifications of the mount. But where Ergotron excels with the LX is that it will actually support curved monitors up to that weight as well, as the curvature changes the center of balance of the overall monitor and puts more stress when extended out than your typical flat monitor. This is usually where you can see other people having issues with sag when approaching the upper limits of other mounting systems. These have not sagged at all since tightening down the screws and move with a fair bit of range, staying in place afterwards. However I do not extensively move my monitors around often and don't know how well it would hold up if you just kept moving them around constantly, though with the construction quality I'd wager it would be fine.One thing I was told from a friend who has the same mount: if your monitor is really bottom heavy for whatever reason and you decide to use it portrait style, the minor taps and thumps from your desk will cause it to try to rotate back to a horizontal position, skewed about 5-10 degrees. It's very minor and just takes a quick second to readjust but keep in mind that it may happen as 1 side is now far heavier than the other.______________________________________________________Setup process:9/10The setup itself was very easy. I saw other reviews having issues with it and maybe getting some help but if you follow the instructions provided, it is extremely easy, especially compared to setting up other mounts where you have to screw in the whole assembly to the monitor and take the entire piece and clamp it on your desk. You need to clamp down the base and bottom arm portions of the mount, then screw in the upper portions to the monitors BEFORE putting the rest of the mount together. The top arm portion falls right into the bottom and you just tighten the screw afterwards. If you can physically lift your monitor + 8 ounces or so, you will have no issues putting it together. One thing I will note: tightening the actual swivel head on the monitor so that the tension matches the weight of the monitor may be difficult if you are short since it adjusts from the top.WARNING: If your desk is particle board or something, I highly recommend buying reinforcement plates for the clamp. The clamp that the LX comes with is fairly sizeable but if you're going to be putting 50 lbs of pressure on 1 spot on your desk, it's best to not worry about the weight snapping your desk in half. If your desk isn't sturdy material: the arm mount will hold up, your desk will not. You're already splurging on this mount, don't cheap out and break your desk and potentially your monitors by skimping out on a $10 metal plate. If you don't want to go that route and don't care much about aesthetics, you can just use some wood.______________________________________________________Cable management:5/10Cable management looked like a mere afterthought. It's serviceable and hides the cables well enough but it's nothing to write home about. This feature has been better executed in cheaper models.______________________________________________________Range of motion:8/10Range of motion is better than most for sure. While it will still hold them in place, some positions and setups can be limited if you have enormous monitors. If you're using 2 24"" monitors you will have zero issues, but the more you approach 40"", even on 1 monitor, the options get more and more limited.______________________________________________________Final notes:I wish the pole was longer. That would solve a lot of issues people have had with mobility using large monitors. The arm mounts themselves hold up well, the fitting of large monitors just leaves something to be desired, especially out of something as expensive as this.",1

I would say every part of the mount is about 20% larger than expected. Everything about this unit is solid and substantial. This dual version comes with lots of extra or optional hardware, including the notebook tray and some small attachments for it (flexible clips, loops for cable management, non-slip pads).Movement: Using the monitor(s) from both sides of the desk and in a variety of positions, easy movement is important: 8.5/10 on that score. Adjusting the tension, there are trade offs between ease of movement and stability, but overall it's quite good.Compatibility: Consider the strength of your desk before buying; a bit of ingenuity can make this stand work with just about any desk, but it may require modifications such as counterweights, wood spacers to brace the bottom clamp, or in my current case, re-tasking your OEM monitor stand to brace one elbow, spreading out the stress on the desk surface. Any Ikea desktop more than half an inch thick is likely thin laminate sandwiching layers of cardboard honeycomb and will not stand up to the weight of even a single monitor on this mount.Standing Desk: Using this arm to turn your sitting desk into a standing desk is doable, but a kludge. You would probably need to be shorter than about 5'3"" to face the monitor head-on, but tilting it upward from its highest point works fine. Some people say looking slightly downward is the most ergonomic way to use a monitor. When I was doing the sit/stand thing, I used the notebook tray on the second arm to hold a shelf for my keyboard and mouse. It required some reinforcement to cut vibration, and a separate riser would be better if you have the desk space.I've also ""pinned"" tablets to the notebook tray a couple different ways so I could face them from a reclining position to read. It's kind of overkill for a device that's already pretty easy to handle, but at least I won't drop the tablet on my face if I fall asleep :)Overall I'd rate arms like these as vital as a good chair for anyone who spends some time with their PC. Two years in, wear and tear looks similar to the one year mark: some corrosion spotting on the base, some paint coming off the post, the plastic sleeves that space the arms out from the posts have cracked, but remain usable. Overall it's still attractive and functional, and should remain so for years to come.",1

The pole is completely solid, though through all the joints in the arms there is a bit of play. Basically if you bump into the monitors they will wiggle back and forth until they settle, however the movement is small and if you aren't bumping into them they don't move at all. The mount works well.Downsides: arms are beefy and take up some space, ESPECIALLY factoring in the joint at the monitor. Basically make sure you have some space because the parts are soo damn big! I'm not sure but I get the impression that you could put a couple 27s on here or something heavy because this thing is a beast.i was shipped the version WITH the laptop stand, so you can use it with 2 monitors or a monitor and a laptop. the laptop stand is probably part of the reason the arms are so beefy.i will say that the human scale single monitor arm that I have is at least ten times more svelt and sleek, but it's clearly not as strong / beefy. If you need something that looks really nice this ergotron isn't it...though it still looks pretty good. just the wires don't disspear as much, and the black and silver look just isn't awesome. also, the friction adjustments on the human scale seem cheap compared to the adjustments here on the ergotron. they both do the same thing, but for the most part i like the ergotron better. that said, if I didn't need stacking and didn't care about cost, and had a desk where the arms were visible (no wall) i'd buy a couple human scales. those conditions not withstanding (i.e. most situations) the ergotron is the one!All in all, this has got to be the best value in monitor arms out there. you don't have to stack with it, and you dont' have to use the laptop mount, but you WILL be happy with the strength and obvious quality, and you'll be thinking ""how could this be so cheap?""",1

Well, you do get what you pay for and I had to return that one. This Ergotron is built very strong. The arm tensions were easy to adjust and they are quite stable. The monitors swivel easily but do not move so easily that they turn by themselves. I have one monitor that I constantly move from horizontal to vertical because of the different types of documents that I use...and I love it.I decided to buy this because I was constantly getting headaches from vision problems. This has helped significantly. I was shopping for this for a while and I just found it too expensive so I kept putting this off. This is one of those times when I wish I had done this sooner. It is worth the investment.I have a large Hon desk with a rectangular hole for wires on each side. I mounted this to one of the holes and moved it to the edge of the rectangle so half the hole was still exposed and I could still run the wires though it. PERFECT. There was a piece of cardboard below the hole in my desk that I had to remove but that only took a few seconds.This also came with a laptop support which I wasn't expecting. Nice surprise! The only gripe that I have about this is that the arms fit so loosely together that they are slightly tilted. It's almost as if the hole in the arm is too big for the tube it mounts too. You can actually see that it is crooked and even if you tighten the arm (there is an adjustment screw at the base). Maybe the plastic sleeves are too thin. It's an eye sore for me and of course no one else in my office sees it so I must be crazy but it really does drive me batty.The finish is a polished aluminum and it has black joints so the 2 tone looks really sharp. The cable management works well and I had to buy a 10 ft monitor cable which worked perfectly with these arms. It is the only monitor arm I found with a 25inch extension as most are 20 inches and since my desk is so large I needed the extra 5. Besides you can purchase an additional arm which will give you another 10 inches although I tried this with the extra 3rd arm and found there were too many joint so it kind of had a mind of it's own when I moved it around from my seated position at the desk. Keep in mind that you can tighten one of the joints to a fixed position to avoid that but I wanted to be able to move these completely out of the way. The base tube reaches 13.5 inches from the desk surface as you can see in the picture included.The big bonus was the extra desk space. I didn't realize how much extra room this would give me until I put this together.",2

I searched all over the internet for a monitor stand that would offer some flexibility in what it could offer and this is the one I settled on.  To each their own.My thoughts so far;The pros: strong arms rated for heavier monitors, a laptop option, adjustable height arms as well as the support base gives multiple ways to move the arms independently from each other and even swap side to side if I so choose (some stands the arms will conflict with one another), I liked the polished look contrast against the black, kinda classy. The base is solid with a ""through"" mount option, and the routing method for cables was about as good as any other stand. The laptop stand partially holds a computer by velcro which was very secure even with smaller pieces; also some rubber padding strips provided (both are 3M and good quality).The cons: the price is somewhat expensive, and the joints are incredibly stiff, at least to start.So, basically I have been very impressed with the item.  It seems very well made, I like the look of it, and it is solid, the laptop stand is much more secure than I ever would have guessed and have been tearing my laptop off but better than there being a chance of it falling.  Also, it is natural to grab the monitor, or in this case the laptop case, to use as leverage while adjusting the arms.  I have a 29"" monitor to go on one arm and it will likely be able to handle a bigger model in the future.  But from the factory the joints are LOCKED tight.  This shows the quality of the build, but frustrating at same time.The item came very well packaged, all the pieces set in their place in the box.  The smaller individual pieces came in sealed, consecutively attached bags (for the most part, some stand alone items) overall very organized.This is a really nice item, and although it takes some getting used to maneuvering the ""limbs"", it really makes the desk seem more spacious once the clutter of moving is cleaned up.  The joints are pretty tight at first and may get easier with more use, but as-is and considering the weight they need to handle it is not a real issue.  Completely recommend this item.",1

It holds my LG 38GN95B and LG 24GN650 with no issues whatsoever.I stepped up to this 23"" pole skew from an LX 13"", while it would've been nice to simply source a taller pole for the 13"" model, I can understand why it would be difficult to find. The bases have a few differences from one another, the 23"" pole base has a thicker construction for the clamping mechanism as well as dual jack screws to affix it to your desk. My guess is that Ergotron thought it would be wise to not participate in the ""leaning tower of VIVO"" game. The taller the pole, the more cantilevered force would be applied to the base and desk.However I would like to see more product flexibility, have all LX pole mount series be equipped with the beefcake base, and offer stand alone poles, so that users could then simply upgrade to a taller pole later on in the future, instead of forking out the coin for another complete monitor mount solution.I don't plan on risking my displays on the cheaper alternatives when I know that the steep price reflects in the quality and sturdiness of Ergotron products, you definitely get what you pay for.As for a bonus, the LX 23"" works just fine on the Secret Labs Magnus Pro XL desk.",2

Otnes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2014","I use three monitors side by side attached to one or two laptops. I was going to put a Notebook arm tray on one arm and the monitors on the other three arms of this and the other stand. I bought both the Dual Stacking Arm and the Dual Side-by-Side Arm to give me some flexibility. I'd read in other reviews that the stacking works quite well for side-by-side too. I ordered a Notebook Arm Tray too, and a mounting extension. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the Dual Stacking Arm to see that it already included a Notebook Arm. Installation was a breeze. The lip of my desk doesn't allow for edge clamping so for both of these stands I used predrilled grommet holes in my desk and the grommet attachment for the base. It took five minutes to remove the edge clamp from the base and install the grommet hole hardware in its place. One of my laptops is always at the desk, so I wanted to be able to use the laptop's screen. The Notebook stand allows me to position it so much better than on notebook stands. I do not use the screen of my second (work) laptop, just the external monitors. But I love how these Ergotron arms open up desktop space underneath, so I have ordered an additional single arm stand to mount my extra Notebook Arm Tray on. That way my closed work laptop can sit under the monitors but off the desk surface. It will also make it easier to get to the cords and cables when I am attaching or removing the work laptop. Even if you don't think you need the stacking capability, the staggered arms give you more versatility than the side by side version, plus it already includes the Notebook Arm. I would recommend the stacking over the side-by-side. Don't get me wrong, the side-by-side is excellent too, plus it is a little cheaper. Given what I know now about the differences, if I had to buy over again I would still get one side-by-side and one stacking. I got lucky that my existing grommet holes were in just the right place so that I could line all of these up on my desk top without them getting in the way of each other. My desk is L-shaped (the big IKEA one) so it is quite deep front to back. If could have used the edge clamp, I might have needed more extension arms.IMPORTANT: Follow the order of assembly shown in the diagrams. This is important because you must have the monitors already attached before you can adjust the tension springs. If you don't, then turning the tension screws will not appear to have any effect. I haven't fully utilized all of the cord management pieces provided, because I needed to get everything up and running to do my work. But with the cord organizers and attachments you can route the cords very neatly so that they don't dangle all over the place.",1

If I was being nitpicky this would be a 4/5, but seeing as how there's really no other manufacturer that readily provides a solution to my problem it really is just the best I can get, from what I've seen.I upgraded from an LG 34UC89G-B 34"" 21:9 to an Alienware AW3423DW 34"" 21:9 and wanted to keep both monitors, with the new one on bottom and old on mounted on top. My old 2 arm mount was not going to be able to support this much weight as my other monitor was just a 27"" 16:9 and it barely held those together. I didn't want to have to screw anything into my wall and I wasn't 100% sure on my desk space so I wanted free moving arms for orienting the monitors before finalizing where I want them to stay.Once I got this I was able to set my monitors up stacked on top of each other. While the bottom one isn't quite sitting as low as it can go, it's not far off. But the top monitor is just about using the mount's maximum capabilities in terms of being able to space these monitors apart while still leaving a tiny bit of room for adjustment. I have been able to pull my top monitor forward and rotate it portrait for documents and such though I have not done the same with the bottom monitor.______________________________________________________Overall actual use after setup:9/10The monitors themselves are not on the extreme end of heavy but they're not light. They both fall within the specifications of the mount. But where Ergotron excels with the LX is that it will actually support curved monitors up to that weight as well, as the curvature changes the center of balance of the overall monitor and puts more stress when extended out than your typical flat monitor. This is usually where you can see other people having issues with sag when approaching the upper limits of other mounting systems. These have not sagged at all since tightening down the screws and move with a fair bit of range, staying in place afterwards. However I do not extensively move my monitors around often and don't know how well it would hold up if you just kept moving them around constantly, though with the construction quality I'd wager it would be fine.One thing I was told from a friend who has the same mount: if your monitor is really bottom heavy for whatever reason and you decide to use it portrait style, the minor taps and thumps from your desk will cause it to try to rotate back to a horizontal position, skewed about 5-10 degrees. It's very minor and just takes a quick second to readjust but keep in mind that it may happen as 1 side is now far heavier than the other.______________________________________________________Setup process:9/10The setup itself was very easy. I saw other reviews having issues with it and maybe getting some help but if you follow the instructions provided, it is extremely easy, especially compared to setting up other mounts where you have to screw in the whole assembly to the monitor and take the entire piece and clamp it on your desk. You need to clamp down the base and bottom arm portions of the mount, then screw in the upper portions to the monitors BEFORE putting the rest of the mount together. The top arm portion falls right into the bottom and you just tighten the screw afterwards. If you can physically lift your monitor + 8 ounces or so, you will have no issues putting it together. One thing I will note: tightening the actual swivel head on the monitor so that the tension matches the weight of the monitor may be difficult if you are short since it adjusts from the top.WARNING: If your desk is particle board or something, I highly recommend buying reinforcement plates for the clamp. The clamp that the LX comes with is fairly sizeable but if you're going to be putting 50 lbs of pressure on 1 spot on your desk, it's best to not worry about the weight snapping your desk in half. If your desk isn't sturdy material: the arm mount will hold up, your desk will not. You're already splurging on this mount, don't cheap out and break your desk and potentially your monitors by skimping out on a $10 metal plate. If you don't want to go that route and don't care much about aesthetics, you can just use some wood.______________________________________________________Cable management:5/10Cable management looked like a mere afterthought. It's serviceable and hides the cables well enough but it's nothing to write home about. This feature has been better executed in cheaper models.______________________________________________________Range of motion:8/10Range of motion is better than most for sure. While it will still hold them in place, some positions and setups can be limited if you have enormous monitors. If you're using 2 24"" monitors you will have zero issues, but the more you approach 40"", even on 1 monitor, the options get more and more limited.______________________________________________________Final notes:I wish the pole was longer. That would solve a lot of issues people have had with mobility using large monitors. The arm mounts themselves hold up well, the fitting of large monitors just leaves something to be desired, especially out of something as expensive as this.",1

I would say every part of the mount is about 20% larger than expected. Everything about this unit is solid and substantial. This dual version comes with lots of extra or optional hardware, including the notebook tray and some small attachments for it (flexible clips, loops for cable management, non-slip pads).Movement: Using the monitor(s) from both sides of the desk and in a variety of positions, easy movement is important: 8.5/10 on that score. Adjusting the tension, there are trade offs between ease of movement and stability, but overall it's quite good.Compatibility: Consider the strength of your desk before buying; a bit of ingenuity can make this stand work with just about any desk, but it may require modifications such as counterweights, wood spacers to brace the bottom clamp, or in my current case, re-tasking your OEM monitor stand to brace one elbow, spreading out the stress on the desk surface. Any Ikea desktop more than half an inch thick is likely thin laminate sandwiching layers of cardboard honeycomb and will not stand up to the weight of even a single monitor on this mount.Standing Desk: Using this arm to turn your sitting desk into a standing desk is doable, but a kludge. You would probably need to be shorter than about 5'3"" to face the monitor head-on, but tilting it upward from its highest point works fine. Some people say looking slightly downward is the most ergonomic way to use a monitor. When I was doing the sit/stand thing, I used the notebook tray on the second arm to hold a shelf for my keyboard and mouse. It required some reinforcement to cut vibration, and a separate riser would be better if you have the desk space.I've also ""pinned"" tablets to the notebook tray a couple different ways so I could face them from a reclining position to read. It's kind of overkill for a device that's already pretty easy to handle, but at least I won't drop the tablet on my face if I fall asleep :)Overall I'd rate arms like these as vital as a good chair for anyone who spends some time with their PC. Two years in, wear and tear looks similar to the one year mark: some corrosion spotting on the base, some paint coming off the post, the plastic sleeves that space the arms out from the posts have cracked, but remain usable. Overall it's still attractive and functional, and should remain so for years to come.",1

The pole is completely solid, though through all the joints in the arms there is a bit of play. Basically if you bump into the monitors they will wiggle back and forth until they settle, however the movement is small and if you aren't bumping into them they don't move at all. The mount works well.Downsides: arms are beefy and take up some space, ESPECIALLY factoring in the joint at the monitor. Basically make sure you have some space because the parts are soo damn big! I'm not sure but I get the impression that you could put a couple 27s on here or something heavy because this thing is a beast.i was shipped the version WITH the laptop stand, so you can use it with 2 monitors or a monitor and a laptop. the laptop stand is probably part of the reason the arms are so beefy.i will say that the human scale single monitor arm that I have is at least ten times more svelt and sleek, but it's clearly not as strong / beefy. If you need something that looks really nice this ergotron isn't it...though it still looks pretty good. just the wires don't disspear as much, and the black and silver look just isn't awesome. also, the friction adjustments on the human scale seem cheap compared to the adjustments here on the ergotron. they both do the same thing, but for the most part i like the ergotron better. that said, if I didn't need stacking and didn't care about cost, and had a desk where the arms were visible (no wall) i'd buy a couple human scales. those conditions not withstanding (i.e. most situations) the ergotron is the one!All in all, this has got to be the best value in monitor arms out there. you don't have to stack with it, and you dont' have to use the laptop mount, but you WILL be happy with the strength and obvious quality, and you'll be thinking ""how could this be so cheap?""",2

Well, you do get what you pay for and I had to return that one. This Ergotron is built very strong. The arm tensions were easy to adjust and they are quite stable. The monitors swivel easily but do not move so easily that they turn by themselves. I have one monitor that I constantly move from horizontal to vertical because of the different types of documents that I use...and I love it.I decided to buy this because I was constantly getting headaches from vision problems. This has helped significantly. I was shopping for this for a while and I just found it too expensive so I kept putting this off. This is one of those times when I wish I had done this sooner. It is worth the investment.I have a large Hon desk with a rectangular hole for wires on each side. I mounted this to one of the holes and moved it to the edge of the rectangle so half the hole was still exposed and I could still run the wires though it. PERFECT. There was a piece of cardboard below the hole in my desk that I had to remove but that only took a few seconds.This also came with a laptop support which I wasn't expecting. Nice surprise! The only gripe that I have about this is that the arms fit so loosely together that they are slightly tilted. It's almost as if the hole in the arm is too big for the tube it mounts too. You can actually see that it is crooked and even if you tighten the arm (there is an adjustment screw at the base). Maybe the plastic sleeves are too thin. It's an eye sore for me and of course no one else in my office sees it so I must be crazy but it really does drive me batty.The finish is a polished aluminum and it has black joints so the 2 tone looks really sharp. The cable management works well and I had to buy a 10 ft monitor cable which worked perfectly with these arms. It is the only monitor arm I found with a 25inch extension as most are 20 inches and since my desk is so large I needed the extra 5. Besides you can purchase an additional arm which will give you another 10 inches although I tried this with the extra 3rd arm and found there were too many joint so it kind of had a mind of it's own when I moved it around from my seated position at the desk. Keep in mind that you can tighten one of the joints to a fixed position to avoid that but I wanted to be able to move these completely out of the way. The base tube reaches 13.5 inches from the desk surface as you can see in the picture included.The big bonus was the extra desk space. I didn't realize how much extra room this would give me until I put this together.",2

I searched all over the internet for a monitor stand that would offer some flexibility in what it could offer and this is the one I settled on.  To each their own.My thoughts so far;The pros: strong arms rated for heavier monitors, a laptop option, adjustable height arms as well as the support base gives multiple ways to move the arms independently from each other and even swap side to side if I so choose (some stands the arms will conflict with one another), I liked the polished look contrast against the black, kinda classy. The base is solid with a ""through"" mount option, and the routing method for cables was about as good as any other stand. The laptop stand partially holds a computer by velcro which was very secure even with smaller pieces; also some rubber padding strips provided (both are 3M and good quality).The cons: the price is somewhat expensive, and the joints are incredibly stiff, at least to start.So, basically I have been very impressed with the item.  It seems very well made, I like the look of it, and it is solid, the laptop stand is much more secure than I ever would have guessed and have been tearing my laptop off but better than there being a chance of it falling.  Also, it is natural to grab the monitor, or in this case the laptop case, to use as leverage while adjusting the arms.  I have a 29"" monitor to go on one arm and it will likely be able to handle a bigger model in the future.  But from the factory the joints are LOCKED tight.  This shows the quality of the build, but frustrating at same time.The item came very well packaged, all the pieces set in their place in the box.  The smaller individual pieces came in sealed, consecutively attached bags (for the most part, some stand alone items) overall very organized.This is a really nice item, and although it takes some getting used to maneuvering the ""limbs"", it really makes the desk seem more spacious once the clutter of moving is cleaned up.  The joints are pretty tight at first and may get easier with more use, but as-is and considering the weight they need to handle it is not a real issue.  Completely recommend this item.",2

It holds my LG 38GN95B and LG 24GN650 with no issues whatsoever.I stepped up to this 23"" pole skew from an LX 13"", while it would've been nice to simply source a taller pole for the 13"" model, I can understand why it would be difficult to find. The bases have a few differences from one another, the 23"" pole base has a thicker construction for the clamping mechanism as well as dual jack screws to affix it to your desk. My guess is that Ergotron thought it would be wise to not participate in the ""leaning tower of VIVO"" game. The taller the pole, the more cantilevered force would be applied to the base and desk.However I would like to see more product flexibility, have all LX pole mount series be equipped with the beefcake base, and offer stand alone poles, so that users could then simply upgrade to a taller pole later on in the future, instead of forking out the coin for another complete monitor mount solution.I don't plan on risking my displays on the cheaper alternatives when I know that the steep price reflects in the quality and sturdiness of Ergotron products, you definitely get what you pay for.As for a bonus, the LX 23"" works just fine on the Secret Labs Magnus Pro XL desk.",2

Otnes,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2014","I use three monitors side by side attached to one or two laptops. I was going to put a Notebook arm tray on one arm and the monitors on the other three arms of this and the other stand. I bought both the Dual Stacking Arm and the Dual Side-by-Side Arm to give me some flexibility. I'd read in other reviews that the stacking works quite well for side-by-side too. I ordered a Notebook Arm Tray too, and a mounting extension. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the Dual Stacking Arm to see that it already included a Notebook Arm. Installation was a breeze. The lip of my desk doesn't allow for edge clamping so for both of these stands I used predrilled grommet holes in my desk and the grommet attachment for the base. It took five minutes to remove the edge clamp from the base and install the grommet hole hardware in its place. One of my laptops is always at the desk, so I wanted to be able to use the laptop's screen. The Notebook stand allows me to position it so much better than on notebook stands. I do not use the screen of my second (work) laptop, just the external monitors. But I love how these Ergotron arms open up desktop space underneath, so I have ordered an additional single arm stand to mount my extra Notebook Arm Tray on. That way my closed work laptop can sit under the monitors but off the desk surface. It will also make it easier to get to the cords and cables when I am attaching or removing the work laptop. Even if you don't think you need the stacking capability, the staggered arms give you more versatility than the side by side version, plus it already includes the Notebook Arm. I would recommend the stacking over the side-by-side. Don't get me wrong, the side-by-side is excellent too, plus it is a little cheaper. Given what I know now about the differences, if I had to buy over again I would still get one side-by-side and one stacking. I got lucky that my existing grommet holes were in just the right place so that I could line all of these up on my desk top without them getting in the way of each other. My desk is L-shaped (the big IKEA one) so it is quite deep front to back. If could have used the edge clamp, I might have needed more extension arms.IMPORTANT: Follow the order of assembly shown in the diagrams. This is important because you must have the monitors already attached before you can adjust the tension springs. If you don't, then turning the tension screws will not appear to have any effect. I haven't fully utilized all of the cord management pieces provided, because I needed to get everything up and running to do my work. But with the cord organizers and attachments you can route the cords very neatly so that they don't dangle all over the place.",2

Super.Übereinander passen 2 Monitore leider nur bis zu einer Größe von 24"" und wenn man den einen Monitor am Haltearm ganz unten und den anderen ganz oben Befestigt.Schade, hier hätte ich für den Preis mehr Flexibilität erwartet.(Es gibt noch die Hydraulischen Arme für die Sitz-Steharbeitsplätze, diese scheinen mehr Spiel nach oben und unten zu haben obwohl Sie nicht viel größer sind. Zumindest sind viel mehr cm bei der Verstellbarkeit auf der Ergotron HP angegeben.)Als Schreibtisch habe ich ein zusammengestelltes Modell aus der Ikea Galant Reihe. Hier sind die Arbeitsplatten 2cm dick.Mehr Belastung würde ich den Platten jetzt aber nicht zutrauen, man sieht merklich wie sich die Platte etwas biegt, wenn man die Monitore mal vorne anhebt und loslässt.Ich hoffe das hält reißt mir nicht irgendwann raus. Wäre die Befestigungsplatte auf der Unterseite etwas breiter, würde sich das besser verteilen.Die Monitore wackeln nur wenig, wenn man den Schreibtisch anstößt und sind, je nach Stoßstärke, in maximal 15 Sekunden wieder ruhig.Auf jeden Fall kann eine Katze über den Tisch rennen ohne das es störend wackelt.Die Feststellung funktioniert bei mir leider nicht, ich wollte bei dem 2 Monitor den am Hauptstab befestigten Arm Fixieren. Das ist schon so festgedreht das nix mehr geht, aber bewegen (wenn auch schwer) lässt sich der Arm leider immer noch wenn ich den Monitor nach hinten schiebe.Das ist Schade, weil ich dann immer aufstehen muss zum verstellen. Das DVI Kabel hat zwar schon 10 Meter, aber wenn sich der hintere Arm bewegen kann ist das leider noch zu wenig.Die Kabelführung ist gut und für 2 normale Kabel ausreichend.Bei der Befestigungsschraube, für die Klemmontage, sollte sich Ergotron überlegen ob es wirklich so einen Trumm von Handknauf braucht. Persönlich hätte ich hier eine 6 Kantschraube besser gefunden.Bei einem Schreibtisch hat man, hinten, auch gerne mal einen Kabelkanal auf der Unterseite.Ist die Befestigung an sich noch schön schmal und stört auch bei den meisten Kabelkanälen höchstens an der Befestigung, kann der Handknauf leider doch schon arg im Weg sein, ich musste hier leider etwas umbauen.Man sollte auch darauf achten, das das andere Ende von der Klemmbefestigung richtig auf dem Gewindestab sitzt, das wird nämlich auch geschraubt, nicht das sich nacher die Befestigung lockert.Achtgeben sollte man auch wenn, wie bei mir, der Schreibtisch an einer Wand steht, auf Höhe des Gelenks habe ich nun leider auf einem Stück von 1x2cm keine Tapete und Farbe mehr an der Wand. :)Da mein Schreibtisch nicht freisteht hätte es auch eine Wandbefestigung getan, mit dieser hatte ich auch geliebäugelt, aber von Ergotron gibt es das nur für jeweils ein Monitor.  Mir persönlich wäre auch eine Wandbefestigung lieber gewesen, dann hätte ich aber gleich 2 Stück anschrauben müssen...und bei meinen Wänden auch die Schrauben Eingippsen/betonieren wie bei allem was man hier an die Wand hängt. Da war mir die bequeme Lösung doch erstmal lieber.Ich mag die Befestigung und würde Sie auch nicht mehr hergeben.Allerdings habe ich bei allem so Eindruck das das Produkt noch nicht ganz ausgereift ist und noch Entwicklung braucht.Aber allein dieses dieses Produkt hier ist, glaube ich, schon seit 2011 auf dem Markt und davor, sowie parallel, gab und gibt es viele andere.Aufgrund dessen und weil Preis/Leistung für mich persönlich einen schalen Beigeschmack hat nur 3 Sterne.Man muss allerdings sagen, das Monitor/Bildschirm Befestigungen, in einer halbwegs anständigen Qualität (oder besser) meistens ihren Preis haben.Ist scheinbar noch keine Massenware.",0

Well, you do get what you pay for and I had to return that one. This Ergotron is built very strong. The arm tensions were easy to adjust and they are quite stable. The monitors swivel easily but do not move so easily that they turn by themselves. I have one monitor that I constantly move from horizontal to vertical because of the different types of documents that I use...and I love it.I decided to buy this because I was constantly getting headaches from vision problems. This has helped significantly. I was shopping for this for a while and I just found it too expensive so I kept putting this off. This is one of those times when I wish I had done this sooner. It is worth the investment.I have a large Hon desk with a rectangular hole for wires on each side. I mounted this to one of the holes and moved it to the edge of the rectangle so half the hole was still exposed and I could still run the wires though it. PERFECT. There was a piece of cardboard below the hole in my desk that I had to remove but that only took a few seconds.This also came with a laptop support which I wasn't expecting. Nice surprise! The only gripe that I have about this is that the arms fit so loosely together that they are slightly tilted. It's almost as if the hole in the arm is too big for the tube it mounts too. You can actually see that it is crooked and even if you tighten the arm (there is an adjustment screw at the base). Maybe the plastic sleeves are too thin. It's an eye sore for me and of course no one else in my office sees it so I must be crazy but it really does drive me batty.The finish is a polished aluminum and it has black joints so the 2 tone looks really sharp. The cable management works well and I had to buy a 10 ft monitor cable which worked perfectly with these arms. It is the only monitor arm I found with a 25inch extension as most are 20 inches and since my desk is so large I needed the extra 5. Besides you can purchase an additional arm which will give you another 10 inches although I tried this with the extra 3rd arm and found there were too many joint so it kind of had a mind of it's own when I moved it around from my seated position at the desk. Keep in mind that you can tighten one of the joints to a fixed position to avoid that but I wanted to be able to move these completely out of the way. The base tube reaches 13.5 inches from the desk surface as you can see in the picture included.The big bonus was the extra desk space. I didn't realize how much extra room this would give me until I put this together.",2

Its extremely stable and works really well.  I have 2 problems with it that prevent me from giving 5 stars.1. I'm suing dual 27"" monitors.  The arms actually have to fold in towards eachother to get them to line up well, which means the ""elbow"" part of the arm pushes back past where the edge of the desk is and hits the wall.  This means you have to move your desk a few inches out away from the wall to use with dual 27"" monitors.  I tried using only the 1 arm (without the bend) but it was too short.  So Maybe dual 24"" arms, or dual 32"" arms would be more ideal... but I was sad that I had to move my desk out 6"" to clear the arms on these mounts.2. The price is just not right. You can get similar type setup for 1/20th of the cost, not sure why they charge so much for these.",0

WARTHEN,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2014","4.5 Stars I like it a lot it's very stable and it's a bit pricy but it seems to be one of the best under $500 dollars. Only have basically a couple small issues.1) no drill template had to make on using a piece of cardboard that came in the box to drill the hole as close to the corner of the desk.2) There is a small flaw is monitor rotation. Basically when mounting the Laptop stand you need to place a small #6 screw going from front plate to the rear plate. This is to lock the plate from rotating. There is also 90 or 1/4 a circle cut out to limit rotation.ISSUE: a) it leave a small amount of play (i.e. the hole should be smaller) b) would be nice if this assembly done back to front so if you lock the monitor stand you can always unlock it. (i.e. If you dont want your monitor to rotate and latter you change your mind you have to dismount the monitor.3) LAPTOP STAND: The adjustable bars don't lock very well I have a 16"" laptop and have the two bars going outwards slightly even after tightening the the knobs the would still move. Fortunately for my the rods touched each other in the center of shelf so I used a zip tie around the two rods to secure them in place.NOTE: the bolt is very long and my desk is 3/4"" press-board/Particle Board so I also added 3/4"" piece wood on the bottom to disperse the tension. recommend doing that if not mounting to solid wood structure whether you use the vice or bolt method use a small piece of solid wood on the bottom should be about same size as the base and 1/2 or thicker.",1

There are some minor annoyances but they were a small price to pay.  Arranging the layout to suit your current task is incredible: Writing an email (or review) and I'll pull that monitor a little closer and toward the center; participating in a video conference and I'll stack them vertically; if i'm standing, I'll lift them up, angle them back and look down at them.As I mentioned, there are a few minor problems:  - The stop-screw to prevent changing orientation allows for a little play so the monitors are prone to tilting sideways just a few degrees.  - The tension on each arm can be adjusted independently, but it's hard to get them both the same.  - Changes to a display's position are not isolated to just one dimension: If you lift the monitor straight up, it will come toward you.  If you pull it toward you it will come up.  You can correct for this but it takes some time.  - Whether I used the grommet kit or the standard clamp, when mounted to the desk, my typing would vibrate the monitors just a little, causing them to shake.  Had I not been able to mount them to the wall, I would have returned them because of this.  - With 24"" displays, the arms are just barely long enough to arrange the monitors vertically.I would not recommend these arms if you're happy with a static horizontal layout -- the various adjustments it provides would be needlessly complicate such a setup.  It took awhile for me to get used to the freedom they provided, I am considerably more productive because of these arms.",1

Lowe,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2014","I purchased this for my desk at work where I wanted to add a second monitor but don't have the room.I had a 15"" monitor on a swing arm mounted on the wall in front of my desk but needed to get a little more real estate so that I could monitor a video surveillance system that I maintain.  I had a 22” monitor sitting at home unused and figure it could be put to use in the office if I could somehow fit it on the desk.Ergotron makes another swing arm mount for side by side monitors, but my desk is mounted to a wall and does not have the clearance for the arms to hang over the front of the desk.  This arm system is intended to position the monitors one above the other, but after reviewing the specifications it appeared that I could make it work for side by side in my application.It works out perfectly for my application.  I had to position the base to one side of the desk, but after manipulating the arms around a bit it fits in the limited space I have perfectly (note: the monitors do not sit perfectly even, but this is not a concern).I am quite pleased with the way that it is build (very sturdy) and the components seem very well put together.  The instructions are good and the allen wrenches for assembly/adjustment are included.I may be getting another for the house (as long as my wife doesn’t find out until it is installed).",2

It seems like it'll last quite a while.  This kit comes with two arms AND a tray for your laptop/tablet (you have to pick from two monitors OR a monitor and a tray.)  There is plenty of hardware and extras, allowing for multiple mounting and configuration options.  However, I will point out that the arm that moves up and down has what I consider to be a pretty big flaw:  It's fairly long, and it doesn't move up far enough.  The top monitor in the picture looks like it's about as far upward as that arm moves.  This means that if you don't want the monitor extending very far over your desk, and your desk's rear is near a wall, you have to turn that arm sideways in order to have the monitor anywhere near the wall.  In that configuration, when you move the monitor up and down, it also moves left to right (or vice versa.)  Considering the number of potential configurations this kit allows for, it's difficult to imagine that you'd find a scenario where this stand simply doesn't work for you;  But if your desk is near a wall without much space behind it, there may be better options available.",1

We use Ergotron equipment throughout our company and won't go with anything else.Note that, even though this is called a ""Dual Stacking Arm"", the only difference between this and the other LX Dual is that this one has a higher post in the back.  You don't have to stack the monitors but the higher post does give you the option to set the monitors higher in the air than the other unit with the lower post.Our only gripe about this unit is the mounting.  We have the typical pre-drilled cable holes in our desks and, while this will mount in there, the bottom plate barely catches and doesn't contact the desk quite as well as I wish it did.  We'll have to see, over time, how the desk holds up to that much pressure across such a small surface area.  If you are mounting this on the back of the desk with the C-Style clamp, I don't think you'd have any problem whatsoever.",1

The answer is yes - no problem!It's very easy to adjust the screen positions although perhaps not as easy as the Human Scale arm I've tried (Although to be fair I only tried the single Human Scale arm).  I didn't find the embedded cable management easy to use but I wasn't expecting to have that in the first place and it does help with tucking the cables out of the way.  That said you have to give the cables enough slack otherwise, you'll find that your ability to adjust screen positions will be restricted.Overall great dual stacking arms and highly recommended.

However tried to stack the monitor and the position of the 2nd arm would slide down the pole. I'm only using a 24"" dell monitor so it's not that heavy, tried tighten the hex nut to the point of almost stripping the screw with no luck.  Anybody else have this problem?  Would be nice if there was a large spacer to seperate the 2 monitor arms.Okay, went through the box of extra parts and did find the lock to hold the 2nd monitor arm.  Love the product, only drawback is the extra space needed in the back to position the monitors, my desk was flushed against the wall, now need to move it forward a little which not to big of a problem, definitly love the purchase.",1

Kloke,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2013","Don't get me wrong, I love these, it's a plus-five star product.But the prospective buyer should consider some issues, and I rated this review 4 stars so that it would be more easily found by the skeptical/inquisitive buyer.First, why do the product specs say <=24"", when many new +27"" monitors weigh well under the 20 lb weight limit? Because at the highest position on the mounting pole, the bottom edge of 24"" monitor will be just under 13"" from the desk surface.. that's barely enough room to fit  another 24"" monitor underneath. So for over/under positioning, 24"" is the current reasonable limit to monitor dimension. Hopefully Ergotron will come out with a new product soon, to fully support larger monitor dimensions.Side by side placement is more generous, but two 32"" monitors positioned side by side horizontally will be at the extremes of the arm positions, with much smaller available range of movement. For this kinds of dimension and placement, two single-arm versions would be more appropriate.Then there's vibration. If you don't have a solid desk, or work in an area with occasional (or constant.. not healthy!) vibration, you may notice considerable shaking of the screens, especially at full extensions. Nothing strange about this, it's physics; but one should consider all aspects of ones use case.Finally, torque from the mount. I've been using the earlier version of this product for almost 8 years (and still going strong), but the press-board desk they were mounted on sagged noticeably from day one, and vibration, mentioned above, was a minor factor. Make sure your desk is sturdy and has unobstructed placement for the product, at least surface 0.5"" thickness and +3"" horizontal and vertical clearance under the surface; some desk styles may need modification.The Ergorton site has a great ""Quick Finder by Display Model"", which seems very complete and up to date:[...]And the community forum is well attended by honest representatives of the company:[...]",1

I really like the mobility of this Monitor mount.  I recommend the other mount if your Okay with setting it once and never moving it again.  This is much better if you change positions while your sitting.. leaning forward or what have you.  I also like that if I'm reading something on my second monitor.. I can pull it forward instantly... I'm glad I chose this over the Side By Side Model.  If the arms were at the same exact height or altitude above the desk, then that would decrease the monitors maneuverability.  The fact that the arms can pass over and under each other allow for many more positions.",2

These are largely non-issues once you get the arms setup properly.1. There is a fingernail-sized piece of metal at the bottom of each arm with the VESA mount. The piece of metal is only there to provide some friction so that the arm does not spin too easily. You tighten or loosen the screw to control how easily the arm spins. There is a flaw in the product design where if you loosen the screw too much the piece of metal will fall out. In order to install the VESA arm, I had to tighten the screw just enough so the metal piece would not come out. At the same time, I could not tighten the screw too or else I could not get the arm onto the pole. I dropped that tiny metal piece a number of times before figuring this out. There has to be a better way to integrate this metal piece into the arm somehow?2. Each arm has a plastic dust cap that just sits on top. There is no clip, screw, etc. to hold it in place. As a result, the dust cap will fall off if you need to take the arm off. The other issue with the plastic cap is that it will not stay in place if the arm is touching the base of the extension arm. The gap at the top of the arm will not be deep enough to hold the plastic cap. You have to raise the arm a few millimetres up so that you create a large enough gap at the top of the arm so that the plastic will stay in.3. The small cable management clips on the underside of each arm are quite hard to use. On one of the arms there are two small hard to reach hooks that you attach plastic cable ties to. The issue is that the plastic cable ties fall off very easily if you ever touch your monitor cables. The second arm has a plastic cover on the underside, but it can be tough to put back when there are a bunch of cables inside. Also, the gap between plastic cover and the pole is quite small so you might have trouble routing multiple or thick cables.",1

It does require some room behind but means my table is clear for all sort of things. Its money worth and if you spread the cost over 5years it does sound that bad. It sure beat buying all the little accessories which is only last for a short time.,1

If I was being nitpicky this would be a 4/5, but seeing as how there's really no other manufacturer that readily provides a solution to my problem it really is just the best I can get, from what I've seen.I upgraded from an LG 34UC89G-B 34"" 21:9 to an Alienware AW3423DW 34"" 21:9 and wanted to keep both monitors, with the new one on bottom and old on mounted on top. My old 2 arm mount was not going to be able to support this much weight as my other monitor was just a 27"" 16:9 and it barely held those together. I didn't want to have to screw anything into my wall and I wasn't 100% sure on my desk space so I wanted free moving arms for orienting the monitors before finalizing where I want them to stay.Once I got this I was able to set my monitors up stacked on top of each other. While the bottom one isn't quite sitting as low as it can go, it's not far off. But the top monitor is just about using the mount's maximum capabilities in terms of being able to space these monitors apart while still leaving a tiny bit of room for adjustment. I have been able to pull my top monitor forward and rotate it portrait for documents and such though I have not done the same with the bottom monitor.______________________________________________________Overall actual use after setup:9/10The monitors themselves are not on the extreme end of heavy but they're not light. They both fall within the specifications of the mount. But where Ergotron excels with the LX is that it will actually support curved monitors up to that weight as well, as the curvature changes the center of balance of the overall monitor and puts more stress when extended out than your typical flat monitor. This is usually where you can see other people having issues with sag when approaching the upper limits of other mounting systems. These have not sagged at all since tightening down the screws and move with a fair bit of range, staying in place afterwards. However I do not extensively move my monitors around often and don't know how well it would hold up if you just kept moving them around constantly, though with the construction quality I'd wager it would be fine.One thing I was told from a friend who has the same mount: if your monitor is really bottom heavy for whatever reason and you decide to use it portrait style, the minor taps and thumps from your desk will cause it to try to rotate back to a horizontal position, skewed about 5-10 degrees. It's very minor and just takes a quick second to readjust but keep in mind that it may happen as 1 side is now far heavier than the other.______________________________________________________Setup process:9/10The setup itself was very easy. I saw other reviews having issues with it and maybe getting some help but if you follow the instructions provided, it is extremely easy, especially compared to setting up other mounts where you have to screw in the whole assembly to the monitor and take the entire piece and clamp it on your desk. You need to clamp down the base and bottom arm portions of the mount, then screw in the upper portions to the monitors BEFORE putting the rest of the mount together. The top arm portion falls right into the bottom and you just tighten the screw afterwards. If you can physically lift your monitor + 8 ounces or so, you will have no issues putting it together. One thing I will note: tightening the actual swivel head on the monitor so that the tension matches the weight of the monitor may be difficult if you are short since it adjusts from the top.WARNING: If your desk is particle board or something, I highly recommend buying reinforcement plates for the clamp. The clamp that the LX comes with is fairly sizeable but if you're going to be putting 50 lbs of pressure on 1 spot on your desk, it's best to not worry about the weight snapping your desk in half. If your desk isn't sturdy material: the arm mount will hold up, your desk will not. You're already splurging on this mount, don't cheap out and break your desk and potentially your monitors by skimping out on a $10 metal plate. If you don't want to go that route and don't care much about aesthetics, you can just use some wood.______________________________________________________Cable management:5/10Cable management looked like a mere afterthought. It's serviceable and hides the cables well enough but it's nothing to write home about. This feature has been better executed in cheaper models.______________________________________________________Range of motion:8/10Range of motion is better than most for sure. While it will still hold them in place, some positions and setups can be limited if you have enormous monitors. If you're using 2 24"" monitors you will have zero issues, but the more you approach 40"", even on 1 monitor, the options get more and more limited.______________________________________________________Final notes:I wish the pole was longer. That would solve a lot of issues people have had with mobility using large monitors. The arm mounts themselves hold up well, the fitting of large monitors just leaves something to be desired, especially out of something as expensive as this.",1

I would say every part of the mount is about 20% larger than expected. Everything about this unit is solid and substantial. This dual version comes with lots of extra or optional hardware, including the notebook tray and some small attachments for it (flexible clips, loops for cable management, non-slip pads).Movement: Using the monitor(s) from both sides of the desk and in a variety of positions, easy movement is important: 8.5/10 on that score. Adjusting the tension, there are trade offs between ease of movement and stability, but overall it's quite good.Compatibility: Consider the strength of your desk before buying; a bit of ingenuity can make this stand work with just about any desk, but it may require modifications such as counterweights, wood spacers to brace the bottom clamp, or in my current case, re-tasking your OEM monitor stand to brace one elbow, spreading out the stress on the desk surface. Any Ikea desktop more than half an inch thick is likely thin laminate sandwiching layers of cardboard honeycomb and will not stand up to the weight of even a single monitor on this mount.Standing Desk: Using this arm to turn your sitting desk into a standing desk is doable, but a kludge. You would probably need to be shorter than about 5'3"" to face the monitor head-on, but tilting it upward from its highest point works fine. Some people say looking slightly downward is the most ergonomic way to use a monitor. When I was doing the sit/stand thing, I used the notebook tray on the second arm to hold a shelf for my keyboard and mouse. It required some reinforcement to cut vibration, and a separate riser would be better if you have the desk space.I've also ""pinned"" tablets to the notebook tray a couple different ways so I could face them from a reclining position to read. It's kind of overkill for a device that's already pretty easy to handle, but at least I won't drop the tablet on my face if I fall asleep :)Overall I'd rate arms like these as vital as a good chair for anyone who spends some time with their PC. Two years in, wear and tear looks similar to the one year mark: some corrosion spotting on the base, some paint coming off the post, the plastic sleeves that space the arms out from the posts have cracked, but remain usable. Overall it's still attractive and functional, and should remain so for years to come.",1

The pole is completely solid, though through all the joints in the arms there is a bit of play. Basically if you bump into the monitors they will wiggle back and forth until they settle, however the movement is small and if you aren't bumping into them they don't move at all. The mount works well.Downsides: arms are beefy and take up some space, ESPECIALLY factoring in the joint at the monitor. Basically make sure you have some space because the parts are soo damn big! I'm not sure but I get the impression that you could put a couple 27s on here or something heavy because this thing is a beast.i was shipped the version WITH the laptop stand, so you can use it with 2 monitors or a monitor and a laptop. the laptop stand is probably part of the reason the arms are so beefy.i will say that the human scale single monitor arm that I have is at least ten times more svelt and sleek, but it's clearly not as strong / beefy. If you need something that looks really nice this ergotron isn't it...though it still looks pretty good. just the wires don't disspear as much, and the black and silver look just isn't awesome. also, the friction adjustments on the human scale seem cheap compared to the adjustments here on the ergotron. they both do the same thing, but for the most part i like the ergotron better. that said, if I didn't need stacking and didn't care about cost, and had a desk where the arms were visible (no wall) i'd buy a couple human scales. those conditions not withstanding (i.e. most situations) the ergotron is the one!All in all, this has got to be the best value in monitor arms out there. you don't have to stack with it, and you dont' have to use the laptop mount, but you WILL be happy with the strength and obvious quality, and you'll be thinking ""how could this be so cheap?""",1

I searched all over the internet for a monitor stand that would offer some flexibility in what it could offer and this is the one I settled on.  To each their own.My thoughts so far;The pros: strong arms rated for heavier monitors, a laptop option, adjustable height arms as well as the support base gives multiple ways to move the arms independently from each other and even swap side to side if I so choose (some stands the arms will conflict with one another), I liked the polished look contrast against the black, kinda classy. The base is solid with a ""through"" mount option, and the routing method for cables was about as good as any other stand. The laptop stand partially holds a computer by velcro which was very secure even with smaller pieces; also some rubber padding strips provided (both are 3M and good quality).The cons: the price is somewhat expensive, and the joints are incredibly stiff, at least to start.So, basically I have been very impressed with the item.  It seems very well made, I like the look of it, and it is solid, the laptop stand is much more secure than I ever would have guessed and have been tearing my laptop off but better than there being a chance of it falling.  Also, it is natural to grab the monitor, or in this case the laptop case, to use as leverage while adjusting the arms.  I have a 29"" monitor to go on one arm and it will likely be able to handle a bigger model in the future.  But from the factory the joints are LOCKED tight.  This shows the quality of the build, but frustrating at same time.The item came very well packaged, all the pieces set in their place in the box.  The smaller individual pieces came in sealed, consecutively attached bags (for the most part, some stand alone items) overall very organized.This is a really nice item, and although it takes some getting used to maneuvering the ""limbs"", it really makes the desk seem more spacious once the clutter of moving is cleaned up.  The joints are pretty tight at first and may get easier with more use, but as-is and considering the weight they need to handle it is not a real issue.  Completely recommend this item.",2

It holds my LG 38GN95B and LG 24GN650 with no issues whatsoever.I stepped up to this 23"" pole skew from an LX 13"", while it would've been nice to simply source a taller pole for the 13"" model, I can understand why it would be difficult to find. The bases have a few differences from one another, the 23"" pole base has a thicker construction for the clamping mechanism as well as dual jack screws to affix it to your desk. My guess is that Ergotron thought it would be wise to not participate in the ""leaning tower of VIVO"" game. The taller the pole, the more cantilevered force would be applied to the base and desk.However I would like to see more product flexibility, have all LX pole mount series be equipped with the beefcake base, and offer stand alone poles, so that users could then simply upgrade to a taller pole later on in the future, instead of forking out the coin for another complete monitor mount solution.I don't plan on risking my displays on the cheaper alternatives when I know that the steep price reflects in the quality and sturdiness of Ergotron products, you definitely get what you pay for.As for a bonus, the LX 23"" works just fine on the Secret Labs Magnus Pro XL desk.",1

Otnes,2014年4月26日 在美国审核,"I use three monitors side by side attached to one or two laptops. I was going to put a Notebook arm tray on one arm and the monitors on the other three arms of this and the other stand. I bought both the Dual Stacking Arm and the Dual Side-by-Side Arm to give me some flexibility. I'd read in other reviews that the stacking works quite well for side-by-side too. I ordered a Notebook Arm Tray too, and a mounting extension. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the Dual Stacking Arm to see that it already included a Notebook Arm. Installation was a breeze. The lip of my desk doesn't allow for edge clamping so for both of these stands I used predrilled grommet holes in my desk and the grommet attachment for the base. It took five minutes to remove the edge clamp from the base and install the grommet hole hardware in its place. One of my laptops is always at the desk, so I wanted to be able to use the laptop's screen. The Notebook stand allows me to position it so much better than on notebook stands. I do not use the screen of my second (work) laptop, just the external monitors. But I love how these Ergotron arms open up desktop space underneath, so I have ordered an additional single arm stand to mount my extra Notebook Arm Tray on. That way my closed work laptop can sit under the monitors but off the desk surface. It will also make it easier to get to the cords and cables when I am attaching or removing the work laptop. Even if you don't think you need the stacking capability, the staggered arms give you more versatility than the side by side version, plus it already includes the Notebook Arm. I would recommend the stacking over the side-by-side. Don't get me wrong, the side-by-side is excellent too, plus it is a little cheaper. Given what I know now about the differences, if I had to buy over again I would still get one side-by-side and one stacking. I got lucky that my existing grommet holes were in just the right place so that I could line all of these up on my desk top without them getting in the way of each other. My desk is L-shaped (the big IKEA one) so it is quite deep front to back. If could have used the edge clamp, I might have needed more extension arms.IMPORTANT: Follow the order of assembly shown in the diagrams. This is important because you must have the monitors already attached before you can adjust the tension springs. If you don't, then turning the tension screws will not appear to have any effect. I haven't fully utilized all of the cord management pieces provided, because I needed to get everything up and running to do my work. But with the cord organizers and attachments you can route the cords very neatly so that they don't dangle all over the place.",2

And that’s the key part, “without issue”. Plenty of monitor arms will work, but not all of them will last. And few will perform the same on day 1 and 1000. Lesser mounts will deteriorate, or simply fail by then. There’s no compromise with this mount. Everything about it is premium.Tip: the  part where the the monitor attaches to the arm can rotate 360 degrees. This is handy in a stacked configuration because normally there is only a small amount of vertical tilt, which may not be enough for the top monitor. But if the monitor is rotated 180 degrees (upside down) you’ll have full range for vertical tilt. I like the top monitor the be upside down since the bezel is smaller in that setup. Or you can just attach the mounting plate upside down and keep the monitor in normal orientation but still benefi5 from the increased vertical tilt.No issues hold two 32” monitors, zero sag. But the monitors will wobble if  mount or desk moves. Recommend a solid mounting surface.Overall, great mount. I’d purchase again.",1

It was far more expensive than the other two mounts I had previous tried for my dual monitor setup.  The previous ones were rated 4.5 stars respectively and ranged from $50 to $90.At nearly triple (or more) the price of the previous mounts, the quality didn't disappoint.  The sturdiness of this mount feels rock solid and the only motion as I grab the pole and shake it is the motion of the desk I have it mounted on.It was incredibly easy to assemble and the instructions were very straightforward.  I wish that, for the price, Ergotron would've added some quick releases to the VESA mounts on the monitor.  Range of motion isn't quite as good as I had hoped (vertically once the arm is secured on the pole) but any desired placement of the monitor can be achieved through a combination of the arm's range of motion AND adjustment of the height of the arm where it mounts on the pole.One of the reasons I ended up with the Ergotron tall pole mount was that should I ever want to go to a 3 or 4 monitor setup, I could do so on this single tall pole.  Or if I wanted to have 1 monitor above the other, that could be easily achieved as well.I would definitely shell out the extra $$ and buy this mount again.  The sturdiness of it is unmatched compared to other mounts.",2

I ended up buying this one because their ""side by side"" model was laughably short for me (5' 10"").This model works super well for me both while sitting & standing. Highly recommend this. I know it says it only supports 24"" monitors, my guess is that's for vertical stacking. Multiple reviews state 2x 27"" fit as long as they are within the weight requirements.I do find I have optimal range of motion by moving the desk ~3"" away from the wall. I could see some users being frustrated by that but it doesn't bother me at all.",2

They're sturdy and the monitors move around. If you have two big monitors that you need to adjust independently, it's a great option. It won't be as ideal if you always want the two monitors to move locked together, since you'll need to adjust them separately.The instructions are only mediocre, and if you give up on them after getting it installed you may miss a really important point (I did at first): you can, and probably should, adjust the spring tension for the joints. So if you have a heavier monitor and the arm is bottoming out, you probably just need to tighten the springs. A wrench to do that comes with the kit.",1

Based off the pictures that are posted by other users you can most certainly stack two monitors. However, the problem becomes you have little to no negative tilt on the mounts which makes it difficult to use the vertically mounted monitor unless you lower the bottom monitor by a lot. Which then means your monitor is no longer eye level and you are staring down at the screen. To fix this, there are two notches on the tilt that can be filed down with a dremel and get a fairly large increase in negative tilt. This does not effect the sturdiness at all. Easy fix to what should’ve never been a problem in the first place.",-1

Jenkins,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2013","I've wanted one of these for a long time, but always had a hard time justifying the price.  I've finally pulled the trigger on it, and I'm really glad I did.  From the minute I started unpacking it, I could tell that it was built to a very high quality standard.  As I started putting it together, I got a clear sense that a lot of engineering and design work had been applied to making sure everything is accounted for.I bought this model because it includes the laptop mount, and I wanted to use the arm for a laptop and monitor.  The laptop mount works really well for my 17"" laptop.  It comes with non-slip rubber pads and velcro pads, so you can choose how you want to hold your PC in place.  I opted for the non-slip rubber, and I don't have issues with the laptop sliding out of place.  I've been pleasantly surprised how well it stays in place.  My only complaint about the laptop mount is that you can't get the laptop down parallel with the desk surface.  It has to sit at about a 25 degree angle from the desk if you bring it down all the way because of the way the mount was designed.  If you set the laptop parallel to the desk surface, it will sit about 5-6 inches above the desk.  It's not a big deal, but it would be nice if it could go closer to the desk.All in all, highly recommended.  The price is representative of the fact that no corners were cut in the design and manufacture of this product.",2

They are holding three 24"" Dell monitors without issue (and freeing up a lot of deskspace!) and the vertical range is much better than I thought it would be based off of the reviews I've seen.  I'm able to get the bottom edge of my 24"" monitors 7"" off of the desk surface with the arms on the lowest position on the pole.Installation was a snap.  I did take the extra step of adding some plywood under my Ikea Galant desk just to be safe as the desk itself is made from particle board secured to a steel frame.  So far, no issues with the desk and weight of the arms and monitors.As a note: I didn't realize that this package also included the laptop holder so that was a nice little surprise.  If I had to do it over again, I'd probably get TWO of these and put my laptop on the extra arm :D  If you are deciding between this one or the side-by-side Lx, I would recommend getting this one since it allows you to configure it side-by-side OR stacked top and bottom.  Highly recommended and worth every penny as it will free up sooo much desk space.",2

I was evaluating whether or not to buy another desk, or to look at elevating my monitors above my current desk. Since I do a lot of analysis with other managers in my office I am constantly showing the monitors that were on the desk. So people either come around to the back of the desk or spin the monitor around to show them what you data you are looking at. The Ergotron LX dual stacking arm allows me to both get the monitors up off my desk, and swings them around easily when presenting to others in my office.So the other features that I like about the Ergotron LX dual stacking arm are that it allows me to look at my monitor's side-by-side or stack them one on top of the other. The side-by-side action helps when looking at and working on longer Excel spreadsheets, and the top over top allows me to work on standard documents while viewing other programs are running on my second monitor. The Ergotron LX dual stacking arm has convinced me that I do not need to replace my desk; I only needed to get my monitors up and off of it. When looking at it from a business perspective the Ergotron LX dual stacking arm can be a very cost-effective item for a business.There have been several of the other managers within the organization that have seen the Ergotron LX dual stacking arm on my desk, and will be ordering them for theirs. It is very rare to find an item that is truly something that you enjoy having in your office, but this is definitely one of them.",2

I have to say, the mobility of this arm is awesome. You can basically position your monitors in any orientation you like with minimal effort. With my previous arm, I'd need to loosen some bolts then get someone to support the weight of the monitors while I moved it, then re-tightened the bolts.With the Ergotron LX, you set an initial holding strength for each arm segment. Once that's done, you can do all the adjustments by hand. The most amazing thing is the height adjustability during usage. I can almost use my monitors as if I was on a standing desk. With the swivel motion the entire monitor can be rotated so that it faces backwards in case you want to show a client something on your screen.On top of this, not all the joints have to be used. If less mobility is an option then you can simply omit usage one of the arm joints. This has the side-effect of also allowing you to push back the monitors a little, closer to the base of the arm. This is a great option for people who have their workstations pushed right up against the wall.This is definitely one of the best dual stacking arms that you can buy right now. A must buy if you need the mobility.",2

Caruso,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2015","Had this arm for a few weeks. Installation was simple if you read the directions. I like them a lot - I was a bit hesitant b/c of the cost. The arms are holding 2 Dell 24"" ultrasharps - I forget the exact model number. I didn't need to adjust the arm tension as they were good out of the box. You adjust them where you want them and they stay there. Sometimes they swivel out of level a bit but you just have to turn it back the other direction to correct it. I have them side by side instead of one on top of the other. They have plenty of room (and weight capacity) if I wanted to upgrade to 27"".It took me a few minutes to figure out where to install the anti swivel (to portrait mode) screw. I used the clamp to the back of the desk option. Everything is really heavy duty except the cable management covers. Those were a major pain in the butt and they felt really thin and cheap. The other cable tie hangers work fairly well. I replaced the zip ties with velcro ones so I can replace as I need to.I would purchase this again without much consideration for other brands.",1

I have had these large honkers on the mount for almost 4 years.  The springs still work great and I can still position the monitors however I want to.  Ergotron was a great buy for me on this one.I've been using this stand system for well over 3 years now.  After 3 years the springs are still functional working the way that they should.  The best part is that after 3 years of use that when I move a monitor to a position it stays there until I move it again.  Finally the arms are easy to position.  I simply and lightly push the monitor to the position that I want it to be in and if needed I rotate the monitor, the arm stays where it's supposed to stay.  This seemed like an expensive purchase at the time that I bought it but now I'm very happy that I went extra on this model as the quality and life of the product has been great.",2

There are lots of much simpler more basic products for a lot less money.  But if you want two large monitors to ""float"" in open air and be very easily reconfigured then this thing is perfect.  It's super sturdy (I actually have 2 27"" monitors set up and it easily supports them).  Arm resistance is easy to calibrate, which means that with a small amount of tweaking you can find the sweet-spot where the displays feel like they're floating in the air and can be adjusted with a minor touch.I attached a piece of scrap wood to the top of a built-in cabinet in my media room, then mounted this arm to that.  About 2 feet away from the cabinet I placed my recliner.  It's a perfect set up because I can easily reach over and pull my monitors out in front of me while in my chair so that they are suspended a good height and distance from my face while reclined in any position.  When I'm not using them I push the monitors back to be flush with the cabinet and they look very clean and sleek.tldr: great product if you actually want the full functionality of a heavy-duty dual-arm setup.",2

I've tried to many different things to reduce the pain; changing desk, chair, keyboard. Fortunately, I think I found the best solution for me. I purchased this and used for about a month. Now I feel a lot more confortable on my back and neck because I can change positions of monitors so easily anytime I need to do so. Ergotron built this very solid and also flexible. Thanks to large freedom of the movement of arms, I can even work while standing, which reduce my pain alot.As many reviewers pointed out, it's very easy to set up (I took 20 minutes: 5 minute for unpacking, 10 mins for assembly, and 5 mins for adjustment) and strong enough to hold two 22in monitors. Also, it comes with many additional pieces for other possible options such as monitor-and-laptop setup instead of dual monitor.I strongly recommend this to anyone who's been suffering from back/neck pain. Instead of spending more than $500 to get a good ergo desk/chair, first try this product !! You can return it if it doesn't fit to you or you can save money and reduce pain if you like this.",2

For Software Development there is nothing better with regard supporting multiple monitors in an Ergonomic Position. You can use them to stand up or sit down. The vertical rotation is perfect if you need it on the fly. I have mine vertical 24/7 but the arms are super easy to rotate or re-position. I've also gained an incredible amount of desk space back as i no long have big bulky feet on my desk from my monitors.There is one CON thought. One of my very brand new monitors is super thin and light. I had to weigh down the arm with an extra 1 lb weight. You can change the tension but its a little tricky to get just right.I'd recommend this product over any other dual arm.  Other offerings by Ergotron have different attachments for the base. The long pole offers the most flexibility with height an arm adjustment. It's also possible to buy a keyboard attachment that goes on an arm so you could have a very free desk.Buy and Enjoy :),2

Love the range of motion, when i'm working I keep the two monitors side by side, but then when I am gaming I can easily swing the ultrawide in front of the other monitor and center it nicely on my desk.Adjustable tension allows me to adapt the arm to the weight of the monitors so height adjustment is easy and balanced.

Lewis, San Francisco","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2012","The fit and finish of this product is really exceptional.  I purchase all the office equipment and technology for my 15-employee firm.  I rarely take the time to write a review.  But the quality of these monitor stands is so impressive for the money, I thought I would let people know.  The brushed steel finish with black trim looks very nice.  The joints all move smoothly with just the right amount of tension.  Assembly was a breeze.  I had purchased monitor stands in the past, different brands,  and they just didn't work well.  Ergotron is really heads and shoulders ahead of the competition.  I bought two of these a few months ago for new workstations and other employees were jealous.  I just received and installed three more.  I have one employee with back issues and she needs to be standing a few hours each day.  These monitor stands make it really easy to raise and lower the monitor.  We have to put a box under the keyboard when she stands to work, but the monitor easily moves up and down, closer and father, and the tilt adjusts, too.",2

Worth every dollar.  My two primary monitors are up now.  I'm going to order a second set to put up my laptop dock and spare monitor.One usage note:I have my desk very nearly backed up to a wall.  When the monitors are each on a dual set of arms, then some configurations need more room beyond the desk for the arms to bend back then forward.  I noticed this when pushing both monitors far from me and centered near the pole.  The arms were hanging over my desk and bumping into the wall.  No worries, there is a simple remedy!  This system is so configurable.  I pulled my monitors up off their lower arm, leaving only one arm connected to each monitor.  Then I placed the monitor-single-arm-combo directly on the main support pole.  This is a more space efficient use for those wanting to keep their monitors all the way back and centered.  I can relatively easily lift up the monitor-single-arm-combo off the main pole and replace it on a lower arm to put it back in ""long mode.""",2

The finish is 'quality' and the system works smoothly. The LG 27"" 4k display is counterbalanced perfectly and can be moved around easily with one hand. I purchased an extension arm for the laptop arm and this adds 3"" to the height and about 9"" to the reach. The laptop now extends beyond the front of the desk and can be used irrespective of the desk height and whether sitting or standing.Cable/wire management can be good for a fixed placement of the two displays. However if the displays are moved around expect cable/wire to be all over the place. Display and laptop cables are never plugged in at the attachment points and flexibility requires variable cable lengths. I have a 27"" display and a Mac Book laptop floating over a cluttered 36"" by 48"" desk which varies in height from 23"" to 40"". The outlets for the hardware are fixed under the desktop with a single trailing cable to the wall.",2

I even use them connected to a Geek Desk that moved up and down and they hold their position through any and all changes in the position of the desk from sitting to standing to somewhere in the middle.I use them side by side with a pair of 24in Acer LEDs, I could see how stacked would work well too, but not my thing.Only main criticism I would have would be cord organization ability, it doesn't do it so great and to do side by side, the arms stick out pretty far off the desk, so tough if you use the desk up against a wall, but it is what it is.",2

I did have to cut a hole in the back panel of my desk to accommodate the clamping mechanism, but aside from that, installation was a breeze.  The aluminum construction is solid and attractive, and easily supports two 24"" monitors.  Cable management is neat, with the power and dvi cables routed inside the support arms, but I did have to get a short extension for one of the power cords in order to reach my surge protector.  Adjustment for each monitor is independent, and very easy, with the range of motion exceeding anything I anticipate needing - including moving the monitors up and out of the way for dusting behind them.  The unit comes with additional hardware to mount a notebook instead of a second monitor, so could possibly be offered at a slightly lower cost without this option (I have no plans to use it).  In all, I am not disappointed with this purchase.",1

Clamping to the desk was a breeze and doesn't shake. Joints didn't need to be tightened except for the one's holding the arm to the vertical pole of course.I bought this for my wife to use at work, she wanted two monitors. At first she thought that vertical stacking of the monitors would be great. After I had set this up on her desk she decided that it wasn't right and wanted a side by side setup. This was no problem with the ability to move the arms in almost any fashion. Now she's a happy camper, and able to share a monitor or two with her clients with out them having to go behind her desk to view what's on it.She works for a small company, so they allowed her to buy what she wanted and then she could get reimbursed for it. If anyone is wondering.",1

I ended up mounting an ASUS VS278Q-P which weighs only 7lbs and it was easy to setup. I was concerned about weight since I have it mounted on a side table. After using it though I am not as happy with using this for a laptop next to the couch. Since I want to type as close to my lap as possible I must have the arm all the way on the bottom of the post and even then the arm does not move enough vertically. I think this would be better suited for a desk, but I'm not sold on it being for a couch set up.Pro's: Heavy duty construction, extremely well balance and adjustable, very versatile, decent horizontal reach.Con's: Limited vertical movement.This was definitely the best set up I have come across, but still not exactly what I was looking for.",0

As you’ll see in the video both mounting plates are permanently facing the ceiling. Even after loosening every pressure screw possible they still will not budge. I will update this post once I’ve confirmed if it’s defective or if I’m doing something incorrectly.Update - after calling Ergotron's customer support they informed me I had to use excessive force to force the mounting plate towards the ground, the product now works as expected.

No complaints about the product, it was well packaged, straight forward installation/assembly.  It was a little tough getting everything in place and tightened down correctly primarily because everything was so heavy-duty (would recommend pulling your desk out from the wall while installing, would have been easier if I’d taken the time to do so), just required a little patience.  After you get everything in place it’s easy to adjust the placement to your liking or between different states (i.e. raising it for a standing orientation or swiveling to face a different part of the room).  I would definitely recommend this product.",2

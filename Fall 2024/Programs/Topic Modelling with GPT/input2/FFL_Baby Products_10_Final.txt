Lotion smells nothing like lime or patchouli.  Lotion dispenser was broken upon arrival.  The lotion does not absorb well into your skin and leaves a greasy film.  Money wasted on this product!

This lotion when purchased at a retailer, such as a local organic store is lovely.  The item shipped to me is not the same item and stinks like cleaning fluid. Not the same item. took me a while to write a review, but decided to help others not waste there money with this retailer.

I like many of Dr. Bronner's products, however, this one is far too greasy or oily and I don't care for the fragrance. I think the addition of the lime in the fragrance put me off.

Gag, the smell is awful and they are very greasy.  I was hoping for better from Bronner's.  Go with Plant Therapy if you're looking for a good natural lotiion.

I noticed that this lotion smelled overwhelmingly like ethyl alcohol, but tried it anyway. It really sucked all the moisture out of my hands and they were very dry within a few minutes. I went back to my old lotion to re-moisturize! Then I looked at the ingredients and the third thing listed was ethanol! Well there you go. I do not recommend.

I was seeking a nice, non-oily lotion to soothe my dry hands in this cold winter weather.  I actually had the chance to try before buying (at my local co-op).  The bad part is, I was fooled into thinking this product worked.  It appears to moisturize for about 5 minutes, but I've now come to realize that after those few, spare minutes, I must reapply.  It leaves a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes me think that the ingredients aren't being absorbed.  My skin still feels very dry.  The fragrance is simply OVERPOWERING.  I love patchouli, and I even bought the lavender scented lotion, and they are both extremely loud - some of the most highly scented perfumes I have ever used.  The first time I applied it at home, my boyfriend asked if I had sprayed perfume.  I am so very disappointed in this product.  Never again will I purchase anything from Dr. Bronner's.  I think there is so much fragrance in this, it is actually stinging my skin.

This lotion is more greasy than I like and has a very strong, pungent scent.

Good product but quite pricy, of course we pay for the convenience of home delivery.  .  Next time I will shop around.

I love how this treats my skin but the smell is so extremely strong. I can't wear this to work.

After reading great reviews about the product I decided to try a bottle. Upon arrival I was overwhelmed with the extremely strong scent this product had (overpowering almost). It comes out very runny to the point you may need to wipe some off, but dries very fast, leaving your hands feeling like they did before you applied it. My biggest grievance would be the oily residue it leaves, both my hands and everywhere they've touched has a shine to it now.If you're looking for a moisturizer, there are many products which far exceed this one. Even as I write this I am becoming overwhelmed with scent. Will not buy again!

I was hoping this would have a nice strong scent to mask the cooking oil-like smell of my aloe vera oil, and it definitely does. They actually mix well together for what I think is the perfect moisturizer, and the heavy patchouli scent is much more understated and wearable when diluted, in my opinion. The lotion has a great, smooth consistency on its own, and it smells wonderful, it's just statement-making strong.

This product is very fragrant a little expensive

I think this stuff is great.  I like the smell of Patchouli (in SMALL doses) but actually don't think it smells that much like Patchouli with the lime mixed in, I think it has a nice unique smell though kind of masculine.  If you are unsure, just smell this stuff at a store first, its a matter of taste here for sure.  It is pretty thick but absorbs well, I think its better in the winter as its pretty heavy.

Delivery on this product was perfect.  I got it when promised.  I have the lavender lotion as well.  Love this product because it doesn't have the harmful parabens and chemicals that other lotions have.  I use all of Dr. Bronner's products and love the smell.  Because I'm sensitive to heavy fragrance this product doesn't overpower you and leaves after awhile which is good for someone who can't stand heavy smells.

This used to be my absolute favorite lotion!!  Everyone commented on how good I smelled when I was wearing it.  Now people say it smells like I have Vicks on.  The formula must have changed?

Dr. Bronners products are really wonderful - good for your body and good for the planet. This lotion has the lightest scent of the patchouli and the lime.  It's smooth going on, doesn't leave you sticky or slick, and soothes the skin.  As a Naturopathic Doctor, I highly recommend it.

I like patchouli and lime, felt the lotion was a bit watery and seeing that as the first ingredient I can see why. I make my own lotion and wanted to try this. If you like a watery lotion this would be fine, I prefer a thicker, richer lotion. The smell lasts quite a while and passes to clothing.

This is a high quality lotion, but who ever was in charge of adding the fragrance had either little to no sense of smell or had a terrible cold that day!  If only they cut back on the scent then It would truly be a 5-star product!

Bought this for a friend. Tried it out and the scent is very strong.  When I wear patchouli I want it to be a little on the subtle side and this product is quite strong.

Lasting hydration and scent

Don't buy this if you are seeking some lightly scented lotion...but I love the smell and the stuff works really well.  It absorbs into the skin and lasts for hours.

Night time usage on feet and underarms, If using on arms and legs avoid direct sunlight It may cause Tanning or burn. I really enjoy this product and the scents.

My hands are usually sandpaper and painfully dry in the winter months. Not with Dr Bronner's. The scent is wonderful and for once my hands an skin feel soft. I would buy again & again.

Not cheap, but it's organic and ai love the combination if patchouli (my fave) and lime.  Very emollient and soothing - a little goes a long way.

Our local whole foods used to carry this product, but whole foods is just a bunch of sell outs. We love everything dr bronners. This is our favorite smell. Great product.

Smells so good, calming and happy! Nobody ever seems turned off by the patchouli, the lime balances it well... one of my favorites!

So many people ask me what or where the wonderful perfume is that comes from me.

Non greasy, soaks right in and the slight scent reminds me of the 60s when I was a hippie very pleasant.

Mild yet does nice job moisturizing, great scent

My favourite daily lotion. Lightweight and smells amazing.

Gave as a gift !

If you love Patchouli then you will love this lotion.

This stuff if heaven sent!!!  Love it!

Love both products

I don't think I've ever tried a better lotion. Wonderful product that I will continue to buy!

I give this lotion five stars because the product is great. My skin just disagrees sadly. I never get irritated skin from products. I must be allergic to an ingredient. I use a wide array of bronners products with no issue. The scent is really good. I got lots of compliments. I bought two bottles from a local shop and used this lotion after shower for a week. One day I started feeling itchy. turned out to be the lotion. I'll try with other scents.

If you're looking for a very moisturizing, emollient lotion, this is not for you. If you just love the smell of patchouli, this IS for you!I've become more cautious about how much and when I use this lotion after a number of people (including a stranger at the store!) have commented on my scent. Mind you, this is long after I've applied it and honestly can no longer detect the smell myself! And, as another reviewer mentioned, the scent does pass on to clothing...people have been able to smell patchouli on me even when I'm not wearing the lotion, due to the scent transfering onto my sweater or coat. I LOVE the smell of patchouli oil, but realize not everyone shares my affection for it. ;)

I hated this lotion the first time I tried it. however, after using it several times, I started to change to loving the scent. In contrast to toxic petrochemicals, this scented lotion puts me in a great mood. The lotion is silky smooth. At this point, I am totally sold on lime patchouli lotion. I get sick from the synthetic chemicals filling the stores and on peoples' clothing, so breathing this lotion (sounds strange), helps me to overcome the sickening neurological problems from the synthetic scents. You have to try it.

I love, love, love this stuff, mostly because of how delicious it smells. I agree with the other reviewers, it does have a fairly strong patchouli scent and it's noticeable and lasts. I gets compliments on it all the time (I sat down in the dentist's chair the other day and the hygienist told me I smelled nice, for example). It isn't a heavy moisturizer, so might be better in the summer, and it does leave a little residue on your skin. I'm willing to put up with those things just because it smells so good.

OMG!  This lotion is outstanding, not heavily scented, not heavy on my skin but it does the job of keeping moisture on my skin.  We live in a high desert climate and I simply love this smooth, sleek, lotion!

Dr. Bronner products are great and this collaboration with Sun Dog is no exception. The aroma is pleasing and the feeling when applied is truly like silk. This organic product leaves no residue or unpleasant 'slime' feeling on your skin.

This lotion feels light but moisturizes thoroughly and smells delicious. Good for hands as well as body - highly recommended!

This soap is great.  It doesn't have scent to bother my allergies.  It cleans well but is also hydrating and gentle enough that I can even use it regularly to wash my face.  When I had very short hair, I also used it as shampoo.My only complaint with it, and the reason I can't give it five stars, is that it tends to break in pieces about 2/3 of the way through the bar.  I end up trying to fully use crumbled pieces of soap and way too much of it ends up in the drain.  With how pricy it is, this waste is painful.3/16 update: I wanted to post an update because I still use this soap and it no longer breaks the way it used to.  So upgrading to 5 stars and adding this note.

It's a nice soap.  We use it to give our baby girl baths and she seem to like it.

We love this soap! Huge suds, so that we don't use as much - one bar lasts us quite a bit longer than a regular bar of soap. No smell is exactly what I need, too, as most kinds of soap either dry out my sinuses or make me feel faint, they smell so strong. Dr. Bronner's is easy on the skin, too, not nearly as drying as other soaps.

After trying many different soaps, this soap was the best blend of oils for me. Didn't cause me to break out and you can even use it on your hair if you are going "pooless" (It doesn't strip your hair of the oils like normal shampoo). It's the perfect soap, I just wish it wasn't so expensive, but you are paying for all of the natural oils used to saponify it vs the chemicals in things like dove and lever.

It's a soap, what can I say other than it is organic, it is fragrance free (I'm allergic to fragrances), and it's very mild.  I am on my second box of 12 bars, and that is the way to go.  If I plan my order so as not to have shipping charges added, the price is better than what I have found at local stores - when I can find a store that carries it.

My husband and both sons have sensitive skin, and this is the only soap which doesn't irritate it. We like the bar form because it is easy for my husband to take with him on extended business trips.

My entire family uses this soap.  It is the only soap that I use on my face and my skin is soft and clear!

Non-toxic, no fragrance, no animal product- great soap. Wish it was a little less expensive.

We were struggling with my son's on-and-off eczema for quite a while till we found this soap. Now I also use it to wash my face and it's great

I totally love that way this bar of soap seems to clean anything, from the collars of my husband 's white shirts to the mats of my vehicle. GREAT stuff!

Great for people that are allergic to chemicals in ordinary soap. But it does dry out your skin, so do hydrate your skin after using.

If you haven't used this soap do yourself a favor and buy some.

baby soap

Paid an extra $15 for this scent because the almond smell of the liquid soap is "to-die-for" and I prefer bar soap for the shower.  The scent pours out of the box when you open it, but by the second or third use of each bar, the scent exponentially drops off.  It seems like all of the essential oil is in the outer layer of the bar - perhaps a manufacturing quandary.  This is not much better than unscented castille soap that can be purchased for a fraction of the price.  Sadly disappointed.  I feel like a sucker spending $7 per bar for ordinary castille soap.

This stuff is great. My daughter and I use it and it’s really good for her expense and my dry skin. However,  don’t buy it on amazon or from Dr. Bronners. Find it at a local retailer for about have the price. Kroger sells it for $2.99 in my area.

I have been buying these for a long time, this last 6 bars are not the same quality, its sad, not sure if it was a lot problem or if the product just started to cut Cornes on quality. If it help they had a code 0289.

I ordered 6 bars of soap. I received an open package with only 5 bars of soap in it.

because i used this my face is really dry and patchy. i’ve experienced this before with other soaps but this is different. every time i try to clean my face with my other soap (cetaphil) my face hurts the the point where all i can do i pat it with a cloth. i would not recommend getting this is you have sensitive skin.

This is an insanely expensive product for it to not have the smell. If you're looking for the liquid in a solid form, don't buy this. I am so disappointed but it's not worth trying to send back used soap.

I've purchased the Dr. Bronner's almond soap before and this isn't it. There is no almond scent. I'm not sure it's actually even Dr. Bronner's soap.

Love this soap but it’s supposed to be a 6-pack and I received one bar of soap. Won’t be ordering again.

Paid for 2 pack, only got 1 bar. Will not buy again

We didn't even open the package and the almond scent was totally overpowering and cloyingly sweet.  We returned this soap.

This soap is harsh...not ph neutral.  Like many harsher soaps this bar soap actually strips your skin of its natural oils.  I’m a very active guy, shower a lot.  I ended up with a terrible rash/allergic reaction on my arms, neck area and my eyes from Dr Bronners.  It was so bad, I ended up at the dermatologist getting a cortisone injection and cortisone cream to knock it back down.  This is maybe great soap to scrub a floor, I don’t know.  But, I wouldn’t use it on my body EVER again.

These were counterfeit. Do not buy these from Amazon, they had no scent and were 100% fake.

Bought a couple of these soaps. At first the soaps smelled terrific, nice almond scent.  However, after a few weeks the scent was gone. I couldn't smell not even a hint of almond in the soap. I was very disappointed. Now it's just regular unscented soap. At least now, with the help of this comment, consumers are aware that they may not be getting what they paid for from this this vendor.

Only one bar of soap was received, this is not okay

Don’t be fooled like I was!!! It clearly says 12 pack In the add however I only received 6 bars

I paid 21 euros for 1 bar of soap. The visual clearly shows 2. This soap is great but disappointed that I only received 1 bar of soap.

Ordered this 2-pack of 140g soap bars. Received only one bar. Ordered replacement and you know what? Received one bar again so now have to do a return second time. Very disappointed.

The description says 2 pack but only got 1. Then I ordered again…and again only got one. So many similar reviews I don’t know why this isn’t fixed.

I submitted a return hoping the return would give me a 2 pack as the description say. Nope, still just one bar of soap.

Ordered a 2 pack (as described) but only received one bar. Ordered a refund/replacemnt and again only received one bar. Please do not charge me for the second bar!

Advertised as 2 bars and onlyReceived one. Very disappointed and won’t be buying again

I ordered a 2 pack of soap but I only received 1 pack.

Bought a 2 pack. Only received one bar instead of 2..

I ordered a 2 pack of this soap but only received one when my order arrived.

The product description clearly states "2-pack" of soap bars.  I only received one bar, inside a large padded envelope that could have fit ten bars.

Like others I only got one even though it says package oftwo.

i only got one soap

This does Not smell of almonds at all, it leaves skin very dry after using it, I even tried it on my thick hair as a shampoo, it was a nightmare, left my hair matted and the product did not come out, would never buy this again, just placed an order for the loccitane almond soap instead!

My skin disagrees with you Dr. Bronner. I really wanted to like this soap, but I don't.  I'm using it as hand soap and it leaves my hands VERY dry. Not just "regular" dry, but like "super rusty I need to put lotion on immediately" dry. I'm too nervous to use it in the shower. I do not want an ashy body. To top it off, the almond scent is so faint. It does a fine job of lathering and cleaning.  Ugh, I have 5 more bars to get through.  I won't purchase again.

i have used this soap for 2 years,i just hit reorder.To my surprise the cost skyrocketed! in 2016 i bought a 6pack for $25 and again in 2017 at same price,this time i got it.i realized is was almost $19 for 2 bars! This says it is a 2 pack and i thought i was ordering 2, 2 packs,that is the way it reads.I am pretty sure this is the way it came the last 2 times i ordered Great soap but not at over $9 a bar

I've been buying this soap for years, but I'm afraid this vendor's stock is so old that it completely lost any trace of it's scent.  I called the manufacturer (Dr. Bronner's) and they told me it must have been at least 2-3 years old to have no scent remaining.  Rather than hassle with the vendor, Dr. Bronner's was nice enough to send me a replacement.I've discovered that these are stocked at Whole Foods - perhaps it is better to buy them where you can see if they are fresh.

The item I received doesn't seem to be the same soap I purchase at the grocery store. The packaging is the same, but the scent is different.

Came damaged (after having to wait for this to be re-delivered because the first package was marked delivered though it was missing)

I wanted to try Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Bar Soap after I heard so much hype. The scent was accurate and strong (which is fine for us). But its lifespan was way shorter than expected. At this price, I would rather buy local at farmers markets. That soap lasts a long time.

i was super enthused when i bought these and received them; they smelled delicious and the scent was quite strong which i like, especially with almond (i also bought the citrus ones and my review is the same). i was disappointed though because once wet, the scent almost entirely disappears and does not translate to the skin at all. i found that product to be very drying as well + my spouse and i go through each bar really fast with normal use. overall its a good product, but as a person with naturally dry skin i can't continue using it :/

It's odorless not what I was expecting because I bought the Almond scent.

This soap does the trick and is great for sensitive skin. However I notice that when you open a new soap bar it starts to lose its scent after you’ve used it a bit. Too bad because the smell is so lovely at first!

It really cleans your body good but the citric acid can make you itch and dry your skin out afterwards

As soon as I got the Amazon tape cut, I could tell what was in the box. The fragrance lingers, too, especially if used as a body soap. Pricey for what it is, too, but I like the soap itself just fine.

Think I'll stick to the liquid instead.

After 18 days of use, I had to use another bar because 85% of it was gone and the rest falls apart.  I used this soap for about 1 1/2 years and then noticed my skin was becoming increasingly drier.  I used it on my face for a shorter amount of time because it was very drying and I was starting to look older than my age! The almond scent is great but I found it to be very drying on my skin.

Compared to the body wash, it’s not that great. I used it and it wasn’t as strong but it works

Not as fragrant as the lavender one but still a good soap

The product itself is nice but I didn’t notice and moisturizing

Great soap, feels just like regular soap. And herein lies the problem. It's 5 times the price of regular soap.I'll update this review if I feel anything better or if family tells me their skin feels better after using these vs our regular soap bars around the house.

I like this soap a lot. I just don't smell much almond on it. Maybe that's good, it means there is not synthetic or otherwise undesirable chemicals in it. But I did kind of hope I'd be hit with wafts of almond smell when I washed with it.  I smell it, it's just so faint.

I have no real complaint of the soap since I never used it. I’m sure it’s fine but the smell isn’t my thing.

Feels good on the skin, the fragrance is a coating on the outside the whole bar doesn't smell like almond.

It's pretty average as far as decent soap goes. I really have been comparing it to the Nubian Heritage soaps which are similarly priced and in my opinion are much better.

But NOT better than peppermint one

Soap is great but not sure why they push a all-one-God on their products.

I really love the smell of almond. I smelled it really good before I used it, but when I did use it, I didn't really smell the almond too much. It didn't really stay soapy. However, when I rinsed all I did feel very clean.

little too expensive!!

This is a great organic soap however it doesn't last very long for the price...it will leave you squeaky clean..but it dried out my skin...I need something a little more moisturizing.

ok

Body wash only

soap is good

My skin turned very dry after using this soap.  Is that common?

I started using Dr. Bronzer’s during college because it was so much cheaper than buying several different products. The liquid Castile soap you could use as a shampoo, body wash, hand soap at the sink, overall degreaser…we used it in the kitchen, around the stove and to clean the bathroom. And we would dilute it so a little went a long way. I believe a full bottle back then was about $7.50 (it’s now about $14)So I tried the bar soap…not impressed at all. Seemed to dry out my skin, I can’t imagine using this on my hair. Certainly can’t use it for much else than hand and body so it’s not versatile like the liquid soap.And the price! My bar lasted me for about 2 weeks of daily use and then when it got small, it broke apart into pieces too small to use.At full price, this is about a $6.50 bar of soap that will last 2 weeks of daily use.Dr. Bronner’s went from being the cheap alternative organic multi-use to severely overpriced hipster soap. Fortunately you can get a generic version of the liquid Castile soap for about $9.00 at Meijer that smells similar and works just as well. That bottle will last you for 5 months and it’ll work al through the house. Do the math.

The pics with 6 bars is confusing.  It makes us believe we will be getting 6 bars. Although note that dropdown to select how may you want is clearly shows 1( Not sure if  I am allowed to make a comment like this on Amazon my last review on cost wasnt accepted)

Bought to take on holiday instead of liquid shampoo. Like other reviewers pointed out, it might be a matter of water quality, I found it left my hair dry and unmanageable and with a greasy residue. It's ok as a soap, even on the face, expensive though.

Love this soap— the almond smell isn’t super strong. Get the liquid soap for that.

This is exactly the same product i purchased from a big box store. Buying it in bulk saved me some money.

This is a nice soap if you want a soap that has very little scent.

I LOVE the smell and it seems to clean well. My only complaint is that it leaves some sort of film on my hands after rinsing. It's not a bad trade off for not having any toxic chemicals though. I will probably try the liquid version of this soap as well.

Smells great and feels good too....melts a bit quick.

I like the soap enough but it was nothing to brag about.

Love it but it goes so fast. Smells like heaven and so gentle on my extremely sensitive skin

These soaps are great. I've also tried the lavander scent but prefered this one better. The scent might seem a bit strong at first and I garantee you'll feel fresh all over your body. I have atopic skin and using this soap instead of the soaps sold in supermarkets made a big difference.

Smelled good. Did soap things well.

Love the scent (Almond), it's better than regular soap, but I did notice it does not help my dry skin as well as some other "organic" soaps.  But I still love the scent!

Good soap. Noce smell. Small bar

Smells nice. Almond scent isn’t over powering or smell perfumy. It’s very soapy though. Finished faster than I’d like. Hasn’t dried out my skin. Ordered this soap twice already.

everyday shower soap

Smells good. Seems to get the skin really clean. I'm pleased with this natural soap and will continue to purchase it. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin.

It's soap. I wasn't using this to cure any ailments or necessarily solve a problem but rather just support an interesting company. Let's see....it smells good, is appropriately sudsy, and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry. Essentially everything you'd want from a soap.

I like the almond.

Lasts about 14 daysI wish it would last longer.

pretty nice soap, but if you don't cure these they disappear fast.

This is a nice soap. All natural, long-lasting, effective product. It smells nice, although very faint. I was hoping for a slightly more potent aroma, but all in all am happy with this product. Might try a different type of Dr. Bronner's next time, just to see if they smell any stronger!

Great soap

The quality of the soap is great. It is pure. It smells great.The downside is that it is so expensive! It is about $4 per bar when it is on sale!!! I am not sure what to do because I am allergic to so many things.

A little pricey, but wanted it for my son's sensitive skin, and it smells so good, and it worked.  Will buy again in the future.

I try to buy in bulk to pay less. This is the only soap my family uses, but the bar goes fast and is a bit pricy for how long it lasts. We go through 1 bar in about 2.5 weeks.

Used this to make laundry soap. Smells great and works good.

I like the bar version of castile soap, they seem to lather more than the liquid. Although the liquid ones definitely have a stronger smell.

smells just like sweet almond scent

Love these soaps but my husband does complain a bit about dryness of his skin.

good soap

Been using this brand for many years.  Good consistent soap.

great for hand washing but had trouble in summer with all over body wash not bad in winter

Scent is minty. I don't like it. Nice otherwise

This soap smells incredible and feels awesome on your skin! It’s a bit pricey but worth it. I have sensitive skin and this soap does not irritate it at all.

Useful,

I like this soap because of the natural ingredients, plus the great natural smell. The soap lasts longer than regular commercial soaps. Has a nice soapy foam & it feels nice on my skin. I like Dr Bronners peppermint soap as well.

I would absolutely give this a 5, and I absolutely LOVE this beautiful scent, but I only smell it while showering. No one tells me I smell good, and if the scent lasted longer, I would! Lol. Again, 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ in the way my skin feels…I’m very dry, and I don’t feel the need to immediately throw on moisturizer. It just seems to make my skin feel the way it should, lightly moisturized, and clean.Or- maybe come up with an almond light moisturizer for after shower? I would buy the heck out of that!

Good productive this in homemade laundry soap and for showering

I just love this soap… the smell is not to strong and you always feel super clean after using.

Awesome soap, love the almond and citrus scents, gentle on skin, but also moisturizing. Highly recommend!

We started ordering because it became easier to get and in bulk. So far we love ordering when it's need and always save from price in the store! The scent is light so if you don't like fragrance the almond is a good way to go. Just get a soap saver when in use.

I confess I bought this specifically because some unhinged person on TicToc decided it was Satanic. As a consumer, I sometimes try to do my part to offset damage done by the crazy out there. Turns out, it smells great, has a nice. lather and is gentle on my skin.

A new favorite in the house.  Even people that hate bar soap use it.

love this product!

I’ve  been using Dr. Bronner’s soap for years. I usually get the lavender but it was sold out so I got the almond. I love the mild scent.

I like the product and buy it frequently. Amazon makes it easy to buy the soaps

I use this soap for everything. Right now, I have this as a hand soap in my bathroom, but it lasts a long time and feels good in the hands. Love the company and their values.

I will buy this again

Very mild smell, cleans well, last a long time, no weird minty tingle. Only complaint (which applies to all natural soaps) is they build up soap scum in the tub/shower really quickly. Easy to clean off though.

My whole family loves this soap.  Almond is our favorite but all the scents are so good.  It lasts about 10-14 days on average per bar.  We feel that is a good value.  I highly recommend it.

Hi early the best scented soap have been using it for years now always have to make sure I keep it in stock. Makes my body super soft and clean. Love the convenience of buying in bulk through Amazon.

This soap is fantastic. It smells great and I use it in the shower on my body. I use the liquid soap on my hands at the bathroom sink or I'd use a bar there too. I've purchased a box of blue peppermint ones too and I alternate.

Do you want to feel relaxed, take a bath with a soap without unwanted chemicals, wonderful almond scented with natural olive oil  _Then Dr Bronzer's All-one hemp almond pure Castile bar soap is for you :)

I literally have to stop myself from MOANING every time I smell this stuff. It smells SO good and has me feeling clean and baby fresh when I leave the shower.

I honestly don't know how I ever cleaned anything before finding this soap. I use it for everything...everything. I could list so many things but I think I will just give a couple of ideas people might find helpful. This is great for people who have REALLY dirty jobs or greasy jobs. A friend of mine is a mechanic and I convinced him to try this because his hands were always black with dirt even when they were "clean." He was shocked that his hands could actually be CLEAN clean.I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works magically. If you used cream or liquid products and left them to sit for a bit, it would help to use a little bit of oil (olive or sweet almond oil are my recommendations) to break it down a bit before using soap. Follow up with a silicone free conditioner for your natural hair brushes to keep them properly conditioned because they are hair after all.I also highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with skin & heat rashes under skin folds or bra areas but use the unscented version. I work with unhoused and elderly people who struggle with this and medicine is not always covered by insurance. I'm not recommending forgoing medicine when prescribed, but this soap may be a great option as prevention and to heal the skin as well. Just make sure you dry the skin very well and apply something like Aquaphor as a skin barrier after.

This soap is everything!  And no harmful chemicals.  I love it, it's not cheap, so when I can find it for less than $5 a bar, I stock up and you should too.  Try it.

Lathers well, squeaky clean, great smell. Love it!

Almond soap smells great and keeps me moisturized.

I absolutely love this soap as it’s so gentle for my sensitive skin. My husband used a traditional brand of soap for years that was full of chemicals and fake scent. Now he uses this and can never go back to what he was using before.

Almond scent really comes through but is not overwhelming.

I love the fragrance! I do like a larger bar though.

Great soap with natural ingredients.

Absolutely in love with the almond oil soap here. I think sometimes about eating it. THAT SMELL! Satisfying and perfect for the shower.

Dr Bronners soap is expensive and hard to find, so if you find it buy it.  It is worth the price and quality.

I've been switching soaps frequently, possibly part of a mid life crisis, but in any case I love this soap, especially in hemp almond.  I used the liquid Bronners for a while, but was always too lazy to dilute according to instructions for use on the skin and found it too watery and too strong.  The bar soap version however, has the perfect amount of moisturizing to leave my skin feeling clean and soft without that greasy moisturizing soap feeling.  The scent is light and smells great while you shower, but fades away quickly.  It lathers easily, rinses easily, and is overall exceptionally pleasant and luxurious.

I use all of the different scents they carry but this is my favorite one, super soft and clean smelling

This is a wonderful soap with clean ingredients, and it's our favorite scent!

I love the quality of these soaps, I used them for bathing and to make my laundry detergent. Wish it was a little cheaper but it's all natural and good quality 👌🏾

This is my family's go to soap. We can count on it not irritating our skin.

Everybody forgets your skin is an organ as well we just wear it on the outside. This is a great soap with great ingredients. I've been purchasing this soap for quite some time now. You also notice that there's a lot less soap scum in your shower. That alone should say something.

My favorite scent

Try them, you will like them too.  I started buying Dr. Bronner products in the 1960's.

We love Dr. Bronner's soap. Great product. Great price. Would highly recommend.

A little expensive, but gets me clean with no leftover residue and a great scent

Very soapy

Its a little pricey but it is all natural and non irritating. Lathers and makes me feel clean. We use either orange or almond

I heard about this soap from a story of an NYPD Cop who used this Hemp base soap and tested positive for drugs.That is not why I purchased, Hemp & Almond Soap in this brand is hard to find here in MO. Absolutely the best lathering soap I have used to contain pure ingredients. I have used other scents from this maker, however, this is my hands-down favorite. I gave a bar to my buddy, and he loves it too!!

Love this naturally scented (no fragrance) almond soap but this scent is difficult to find in stores. Ordered a twelve pack and very happy to have  good supply.

All natural! No obnoxious fragrances! Doesn't dry out your skin! Cleans surprisingly better than most other soaps, and I'm mean for blue collar stuff like automotive grime. Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things. I hope this review helps sell a lot of soap. Enough to get my local grocer to carry it ;) Maybe even enough to drive the price down a little. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. PS I use this on my hair as well ;)

Received as promised, very happy with the delivery and product is in great condition.  Absolutely love this soap!  And having a hard time finding it in the grocery stores at this time.

Non toxic. All green EWG rating. If you doubt that chemicals and toxins attach to your cells and cause health issues, you would be mistaken. I had a neuro lipid IGL test after having significant health issues and found chemicals in common products attached to my mitochondria/cells. I now use Suzanne Somers organic cosmetics and go to an organic hair salon. The test revealed quite a bit of info, but seeing chemicals in normal everyday soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, and hair dye attached to my cells was unexpected. I use EWG to rate products and I steer clear of all products that have unnecessary chemicals. As I attempt to improve my health, I share the same attitude when it comes to going to the grocery store; all organic, nothing processed and as clean as possible. Anything else is a chemical crap storm and if I were not on Amazon, I would swear instead of saying “crap.”

We've been using Dr Bronner's soaps for years now and just love them all. Our favorites are this almond scent and the orange scent. We use the bars and the liquid. They are all fantastic. If I had to find something negative to say, it would be that during the dry winter season, the liquid soaps can be drying to your skin. We add avocado oil to the hand soap dispensers to help with that issue. We use the liquid soaps in foaming dispensers and they foam great. Just add a few drops of your favorite oil to it to help with the drying effects during the winters. Since the oil will simply sit on top of the liquid in the dispenser, we give it a shake before each use to make sure that the oil is in every squirt. Thanks Dr Bronner's for great products and your love for planet Earth and being good stewards of it all.

My go to bar soap!  Smells great and sensitive to the skin.

I have very sensitive skin and this soap does not irritate it.

I have very sensitive skin and have been using this soap for several years. These 6 bars will last a long time.

My friend turned me on to using this as shampoo. Since coming out West, with the dry air and hard water, my hair has been limp, to the point I could see scalp and thought I may have been losing hair. But since using this, my hair is very full bodied and it is easy to manage. The first time I tried it, I had doubts, because when I ran my hand through in the shower after washing it with this soap, and my hand barely moved. You could say it was squeaky clean. I like the peppermint scent. I also used it as a body soap. But where this product really shines is as a  natural shampoo. I ordered the bar because the website said the bar works better with hard water. It lathers easily. I ordered the recommended Dr. Bonners citrus rinse but haven’t tried it yet. All in all, I’m really happy with this purchase.Update: Although I still like this soap, I don’t think I’ll be buying the bar anymore, because I found that it doesn’t last long. It disintegrates fast, into a soft sloppy mess. I’ll try the liquid.

Nice and minty...makes you smell great afterword and very cool!

Not harsh on my skin or my family’s skin. The smell is not overwhelming and leaves the skin smelling and feeling good.

I’ve been using for more than 20 years, and I will never use anything else. Both the products and the company behind them are exceptional!

Soap that is gentle on the skin, lathers richly, and smells invigorating. I find the scent of peppermint cooling in the summer.

Tingly kind of soap!

Love this soap smells fresh and is gentle with the skin

I’ve been using Dr. Bronners liquid peppermint soap for decades to bathe with. I wanted to continue using this great product, but also it is important to me to use less plastic. The bar is a good alternative. It lathers well and bar last many weeks.

Fav soap ever & a good price

Perfect for sensitive skin and even better for the environment. Dr. Bronner’s peppermint soap smells A-MA-ZING; tub or shower, you won’t regret it!

A lot of people complain that the Dr. Bronner’s liquid peppermint soap is too strong. If you feel that way, I’ll strongly recommend the bar soap. You feel the cooling sensation but it is not overwhelming. The bar lasts a long time too. I’ll definitely purchase again.

Love everything about Dr. Bronner products. We like the mint best. Soap, bar soap, toothpaste, lip balm, etc.  This bar soap lathers and cleans great.  Used by the whole family, some of us have sensitive skin, others don't.  Great for all. Hooked!!!

This leaves you squeaky clean. Love the peppermint scent.  Even my husband who says he does not like ‘fancy soap’ — is a convert.  Dr Bronners is now our favorite bar soap and is part of our supermarket list.  Highly recommend.

Love this bar of soap.  Pure and great smell.  AND it does not over power you all day!  Excellent

Great for cleansing. No oily residue

I use in making my own detergent. Great smell.

A great bar of soap and nice scent.

Thx

hooked for life!

BEST SOAP EVER

Love it.

Took a while to ship but it's great.

Smells great! A MAN's soap!

Great smell, feels lovely on the skin, just runs out quickly. Expect to use two bars a month if you shower daily.

Currently fanning my vagina because some soap dropped down there and now it feels like hell 😭😂BUTTTTT... THIS SOAP IS THE REAL DEAL. I thought everyone was being extra. NOOOOOO.... my sins legit washed away lol. I’m a WHOLE skin tone lighter all jokes aside😭 Jesus is smiling down from the heaven gates right now. My skin is straight SQUEAKING like a mopped floor😳 If y’all ain’t got this, get it🤷🏽‍♀️ NOT TOMORROW, NOT IN A HOUR, NOWWWWW‼️

Love it

Refreshing and wonderful. You wont be sorry when you purchase this bar soap

The only natural/clean soap that my husband will use :)

I don’t use anything else !!!! Wonderful!

As advertised . Thank you

Ordered a 4 pack but only received 1 bar of soap. No where in the system to communicate this problem.

I use this to make laundry soap. It’s amazing and my skin is so much healthier.I developed an allergy to name brand laundry soap after years of use.Since using this stuff and making my own laundry soap my skin has never looked this good.I buy it all the time for making laundry soap

Perfect for a nice reset bath

This soap is great for face, body, and hair (with a creme rinse afterward). Best part is no plastic.

I’ve used Bronner’s products for almost 50 years.  From hiking and camping to simply getting clean without residuals or perfumes.  I bathed my child with Bronner’s soaps and she’s fine!  Honestly, it’s a great, effective, yet mild bar soap that leaves you squeaky clean.  I would recommend to anyone not looking for built-in lotions and aromas…. Great general purpose soap, too!  I’ve certainly washed clothes with it….and the dog!  Great stuff!

Perfect soap to use on baby's skin!

Excellent choice for dry chapped hands and great for people sensitive to perfumes.

it is Good for the skin

I make my own laundry soap and this works extremely well by grating and including it with other ingredients.

Thank you.

Good soap. But it was also recommended as shampoo ... but leafs hair extremely dry, almost impossible to brush. I bought BOTTLE NONE | be BRIGHT Shampoo Bar for Blond, Natural Red & Grey Hair. That one worked fine.

Honestly, I ordered the Baby Castile by mistake and was going to return it, but I decided to keep it because everything Dr Bonner's makes is amazing. The Baby Castile is a gentle and almost fragrance free soap and works amazingly well on my dog! By the time she's rinsed, dries and brushed, she doesn't have that residual 'new dog' smell (ie new car). She just smells fresh and ready for the next mud puddle. Anyone considering any Dr Bonner's product should just click the 'buy now' button.

It smelled terrible and didn't clean anything.

It's unscented but it definitely has a strong scent to it that I don't enjoy too much. I added a few drops of tea tree oil to mask the smell and tea tree oil is also antibacterial so that's a plus. Also, it doesn't make a good lather so when you're in the shower you don't get the feeling of the soap all over your body and as a result you end up squeezing a lot more than you need.

It's so hard to find unscented products. This lathers up well, and I don't feel residue after I rinse (though I only keep it in the shower, so that might have something to do with it).I usually buy it when it's on sale at Wholefoods, so the price is always good (I'm not sure if I would feel the same if I always paid full price).It does have directions for other uses (I think floor cleaning???) on the bottle, but you have to wade through quite a bit of writing on the label.

I used to use this soap for washing my body or my makeup brushes. I don’t like this for my skin anymore because I feel it is somewhat stripping even when diluted. I switched over to African Black Soap instead. Castile soap is better for cleaning, while African black soap is amazing for your skin. Look up the benefits. Dr. Bronners is still a good soap though

This is a concentrated soap that works. I have used this in saltwater as a shampoo and body wash to conserve freshwater. I rinse in fresh water and this soap doesn't leave a film if properly diluted. I also repurposed a foaming soap dispenser for frequent hand washing diluted 4 parts water to 1 part soap and it foams nicely and is easy and quick to rinse off.

Love this as a body wash. Littleton no smell. nothing lingers after rinsing and it last me as a single user a really long time. It's a good face wash too but don't use too much, this stuff lathers well. And you will need a good moisturizer afterwards. I highly recommend this for sensitive skin. Honestly I've used a lot of Dr bronners products and like most. The other scents work well and do not break me out, almond, peppermint, lavender etc. none have broken me out on a rash. 5 stars for sure

Dr Bronner's has changed my life for the better since being introduced to their brand. I have tried a few different scents, and while I love them all, I keep gravitating back to this non-scented soap for how many things I can use it for without getting any sense of irritation from fragrance. I mainly use it to wash my makeup off my face at night, on my body in the shower, and for my dog come time for a bath for him. It's super gentle on my skin and I love that the bottle lasts me SO LONG since I am able to dilute it and get way more value than just the bottle itself provides.

This is the only soap I have found that is totally scent-free. I date it in a foaming pump bottle and have it at every sink and shower in the house. It is the only soap I can use. (I use the bar version of this for travel).It works well for everything but my hair - leaves it a bit too dry.

I have repurchased this body soap for years. I have incredibly sensitive skin and I love how it foams up and rinses off well without leaving a dry feeling.

This stuff is amazing. Great for baby laundry if you don’t want to use anything scented or full of chemicals. Used it to make a great all purpose cleaner too. Gets stains out super well. 10/10

Great

Great for sensitive skin. Cleans very well and a little goes a along way. Suds up nicely

Products with scents like peppermint, lavender, lemongrass, and tea tree oil are all actually toxic to cats. It's hard to find products without them. And once you use a soap or shampoo in the shower it carries on the steam through vents and into other adjacent rooms. But this unscented version is thankfully completely cat friendly. Thanks, Dr. B's!Just because it's "natural" doesn't mean it's safe for animals. Cats especially have a lot of common things that aren't. Manufacturers need to start thinking about including cat-friendly options among their offerings. A LOT of us have cats, you know. Think about it…

Simply can’t got wrong with this soap. Lathers really well. Won’t bother your eyes either if you get some in them by accident.

Dr. Bronner's soap is a versatile powerhouse! Whether I'm using it for hand washing, cleaning floors and counters, or in the shower, its effectiveness shines through. Plus, its multi-functional nature extends to laundry, proving its utility in various aspects of daily life. A reliable go-to for an all-encompassing clean!

We use this every time we bathe.  Love the no chemical or smell

Purchased this product after seeing MyCleanSpace recommend it.  The first thing I cleaned was my Traeger grill.  No offense to my husband.  I love him.  But he never cleans the grill & it was getting gross.  I was amazed at how easy it was to clean with Dr. Bronner's.  Yes, I have turned into my mother & am raving about a cleaning product.  If you're trying to decide whether or not to get some.  Do it!  I've since been cleaning walls, floors, etc & am amazed at finding a soap that does such a great job & isn't poisoning me at the same time.

Just buy it. This is as clean as you can get!

I love this soap for evvverything. My major reason for purchasing it is for my makeup brushes, but it’s good for washing my face in a rush, getting cobwebs off the cat (sigh), the dishes, and washing stains out of clothing...it really is good for anything I’d use a soap on. It’s super gentle, and doesn’t irritate my skin no matter what I use it on.

We use the unscented for dog shampoo in a spray bottle as little rescue hates the smell of anything nice and will go out and roll in the dew if it smells good to humans. We are all OK with this.I can add my own drops of essential oil and use in the hand soap dispensers.Good very diluted in sprayer for cleaning walls, floors, etc.

Nothing to dislike here", I will Always order Dr Bronners castile soaps .

I love this soap! I have been having sever skin issues and I use this on my face. It doesn’t irritate it at all. It’s the only soap I can currently use on my face actually. My sister had EXTREME eczema on her hands a few years ago and this was the only thing she would let touch her skin.

if you have sensitive skin as I do, this product is the best I've ever tried.  Because it is more expensive than most I keep trying other liquid soaps.  I give up. This is the best!

With washing hands being so essential, you have to buy this!!! NOT ALL SOAP IS CREATED EQUAL! I make my soap for my kitchen and bathroom with this (you diluted it) for my foaming pump. I add vitamin E oil also but this WORKS AND DOESN’T hurt your hands. Buy!!!

Somewhat expensive

Best liquid soap you can buy.

Fantastic! This Dr Bronner’s unscented soap is perfect. I have very sensitive skin and can use this in so many ways from a shower soap, shampoo, in the bath, to hand wash clothes, and more. It’s truly a great product!

I use this to clear up some rash on my face, and it did a fantastic job. I used it for the first the and I've seen a difference right away

Use their products for showers, laundry, etc. Would not trust anyone else. Concentrated and a great value from a highly ethical company. Used for 20 years or more

this is my FAVOURITE soap for washing my beauty blender daily. i also use it to wash my makeup brushes. it’s super gentle, unscented. i love it!

We have used this soap in our shower for years. I am sensitive to perfumes so we always go with the unscented. A bottle lasts us at least 6 months.

I use this soap for EVERYTHING!!  From dish washing, laundry, and hand soap. Literally, I used this soap for everything.

I use this to make hand soap and add essential oils!  I use foam pump bottles and it works great!

Love it..

Soap

Great product

I use this body wash daily on my son and I…head to toe. My son is 4 months and I’ve been using it since he was born..in the beginning everything was fine I would bathe him daily with this soap with no issue. However, lately I’ve been noticing his skin is getting increasingly dry. I stopped using this soap for about a week and I noticed his skin is more supple and less dry.Now for me, I don’t think my skin has ever looked better lol I noticed my face is so much clearer since using this soap. I suffer from very oily skin but this soap just seems to balance out everything. So I found a soap for me but unfortunately I have to keep looking for one that will keep my son’s skin healthy.*PS-this soap is not tear free and don’t even think about washing inside your vagina with it or you will be burning lol

Love this soap.

I love this product.  I have several chemical allergies and I have had only positive reactions to this product.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Also great for home pedicures.

Face wash, body wash, makeup bush cleaner, mopping. You name it you can use it !

I clean just about everything with this soap.

Very great product

Came to us In good shape.  Using now ❤️

I highly recommend this product I use this every day of my life. Definitely will continue to re-purchase this. The only negative thing I’d have to say is that it’s pretty expensive for the amount of product received I wish it came in a bigger size.

After a lot of research, Dr. Bonner's Pure-Castile was considered the most gentle soap you could buy. I tried this soap once and found that it was drying to my skin. I am extremely disappointed In all the companies that state this is gentle. Obviously, no one tried this soap. It looks that I will stay with Dove for sensitive skin.

I bought this soap for sensitive skin.  I can in fact use all soap perfectly fine without any problem.  However l thought why not buy a pure hemp unscented soap thats a healthier and more of a natural choice.  After the first day of using it, I broke out in a terrible rash.  Never have I had a rash from soap before.  I didnt use it for a couple of weeks and the rash went away.  I used it again just to check if it was in fact the soap and not something else and as soon as I used it again the rash came back.  Which is a shame as I bought a bundle of them and had to throw them all away.  So it may work for some however left me with a terrible rash.

This is the most harsh, drying, stripping soap ever made! I bought this in baby mild thinking it would be just what the name says, NOT. This soap strips every bit of natural oil and moisture from your skin. That being said, I gave it one star because you do get CLEAN. I bought this for my face. It burned and my skin was so tight I was putting moisturizers and oils on 3 or 4x a day just so I didn't feel uncomfortable. So then I said I'll try it in the shower. Just as bad, I could feel my skin tightening and drying out in the shower. I bought a two pack so I have two bars of soap i can't use. This should not even be a bar soap. AND DEFINITELY DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR BABY! I'll try the liquid soap to make laundry detergent since it does definitely deep clean.

Ordered and paid for 12 bars of soap, but received only 11 bars.  Soap was not delivered on date it was promised and one bar was missing.

We've been using shampoo bars for about two years and decided to try this one. It lathers nicely but the buildup over time is really awful and not something that apple cider vinegar rinse gets rid of. It doesn't clean well and makes my hair look like it didn't get washed at all. Plus, these bars seem to mold and duscolor. We won't be purchasing this again.

The product is wonderful.  I've used it for many years.  I've always ordered through another source.  This was the first time ordering through Amazon, and the seller doesn't seem to care about fulfilling orders.  I ordered 3 and received one.  From other reviews, this is a common complaint.

Disappointed, not as good for the environment is it makes itself out to be

I would give it a zero if I could. I have eczema and I figured since this soap is unscented, I should try this out, but I broke out in a terrible rash through out my entire body to the point that I needed to be put on steroids :/

The more I used it, the irritation increased. Oh hell, trip to my OBGYN.

I will NEVER use this soap again!!!!

Over charged

I purchased this item thinking it would be excellent for my child's sensitive skin. It was not. Whenever and wherever I used it on his skin he became flushed and itchy.

This product is misleading. "Castile Soap" means soap made primarily of olive oil and lye. "PURE Castile Soap" means soap made EXCLUSIVELY of olive oil and lye. And yet, this soap is made primarily of PALM OIL and coconut oil!Both palm oil and coconut oil are notorious for unethical, exploitative labor practices in developing countries - palm oil plantations commonly use actual slave workers. On top of that, palm oil plantations are possibly THE LEADING CAUSE of deforestation and ecosystem destruction worldwide.In conclusion, by buying this bar of soap you are feeding into a cycle of misleading, greenwashed marketing; exploitative labor practices and even slavery in developing countries; and massive global deforestation.

I paid about 30 dirhams on shipping only just to receive 1 bar. Ridiculous to pay +50AED for 1 bar of soap

This product was described as 12 pack and only one soap was there

If I could give a zero I would. I used this soap in the shower and got this rash all over me. Thankfully I don't use soap on my face or I would have been a heck of a mess. My neck was really bad. Pure garbage and it's supposed to be so pure.

The skin is very dry after using it.

$12-13 for one bar of soap is a rip off. I assumed it would be a pack of several bars. I believe I read in one of the comments that this was the case. I received one bar.

Lovely stuff, gave to my son

No plastic! Easy on my ultra sensitive skin. I’m a long time Clinique ultra mild customer (15 years?) but wanted to make the switch to bar soap to lower my plastic consumption. I read a million reviews and first tried the cetaphil bar soap. That had a fragrance that bothered my face and it came in plastic. I went back to drawing board and found this. It’s perfect. Gentle on my skin and zero plastic. Also not bothered by the fact that it’s so much cheaper than what I was buying before - nice bonus!

Super hydrated skin, not one dry spot in my body, love it!

Doesn't irritate my skin. Cleans gently and no perfume added.

Great brand with no added junk. I feel clean, lathers well, and doesn't make my skin angry.

This soap feels good, smells good, not harsh on your skin leaving it soft. Not bad ingredients. Old stuff but so far the best soap I had tried

This stuff works!  I had heard about them on social media as a way cheaper alternative to charcoal soaps. This is a game changer.

I love this soap, I finally have no itching or rough skin. My skin has cleared up substantially as well. Highly recommend. I use with a poof and can shave with this as well.

I love how soapy it was. Very good for ezcema or sensitive skin. Try not to overuse because it's very soapy and might dry out skin. But it's very moisturizing and gentle

I transitioned to this soap about 4 months ago because I wanted to get away from toxic soaps.  I have always had to do unscented soaps, so it was a task finding one.  This soap leaves a dry film feeling to my skin, but it does not irritate me.  I was happy it was sold on Amazon because when I went to Walmart to get more they were out so while standing in Walmart I ordered from here and was glad they offered a 2pk option.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a natural nontoxic soap.

This product is the perfect all purpose cleaner. I use it all the time and it has helped keep my skin clean and helped to heal my chronic dry skin.

bought this soap on the merit that its good for the environment and can be used for body, hair and laundry as i wanted to reduce the weight of toiletries i was carrying.... wish id just stuck to shampoo, shower gel and washing powder. it didn't wash my clothes very well.. and i HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND USING IT AS SHAMPOO!!!!! it left my hair feeling horrible and my skin dry!The only PRO - it did last 2 months, (using it for body and hair each day and washing 1.5 weeks worth of clothing three times).

I did not find this soap 'mild'. It is far too drying on the body and I would not advise using it on your face as it burns the eyes as well.

Lol I got this because my friends were literally swearing by this stuff but honestly…it’s just soap. I use black soap and personally won’t be switching. My black soap dry my skin out enough and I don’t need another soap to do it too 😭 but if you’re using this to wash and make your own laundry detergent GO AHEAD ‼️‼️‼️‼️

I bought this same ite, in late February for $24 now they want $57? RIP OFF!!!

Saw on tik Tok. Not impressed

I bought this soap because I'm trying to get in the habit of using unscented products on my hoo-ha, but I could not deal with how stripping this soap is. TMI, but my hoo-ha is extremely dry after using this soap and I need something more hydrating. I think I will stick to using Dove unscented.

The shipping took for the while. The soap bar is super small and tiny size.

I’m sure it is lovely.  But $8 for a bar of soap that lasts 2 weeks is a little steep for me.  Skin felt no differently than when I use ivory.

I really wanted to love this. The scent is great - it kind of smells like an oatmeal cookie. Unfortunately, this soap made my skin itchy, so I'll be going back to the Dove unscented bar.

I ordered a six-pack of this kind of soap, which I reviewed as 5 stars.  But this was meant to be one bar of this soap with aloe in the title.  I did not send back one bar of soap, but I did not receive exactly what I ordered.  I would not have ordered six soaps and then a separate one of the same thing.

I use this for hiking to cut down on weight. 1 bar of soap serves as soap, shaving cream, shampoo, and toothpaste.  It works for all of those purposes but it tastes like crap.  While it will work in a pinch I would suggest dealing with the extra weight and space to pack a travel size tube of toothpaste.

Good for sensitive skin, but leaves a film.

The soap is very nice, and doesn't dry out my boys skin.  I like that it's free of everything, and has a very light gentle scent.  The only problem is that it burns my boys eyes.  It's not as bad as the Baby Bee soap, which stings like crazy, but it definitely burns their eyes.

This is mild but will leave quite a lot of residue behind in my bathtub and I can kind of feel it on my skin too. I'm not real happy with it.

Pricey soap!

On the outside the packaging with small pieces of soap stuck to the paper which is not a major problem but on the inside how is it in the video. It is a good product but in parts broken

I usually use Dove bars, have for decades and they have been the best in terms of not aggravating my sensitivity and they do not leave my skin parched, for example like Ivory bar or most other store soaps.I wash my hands approximately 10x -15x a day. I also wash my laundry by hand.You see where I am going with this? I was looking for something exceptional and even more gentle that Dove bar for Sensitive skin.This soap did not live up to the hype:1. It seems to not aggravate my skin.2. The scent is mild and tolerable.3. I did not find that it is any more moisturizing than Dove.Verdict:I spent a lot of money.However,  I am glad that I gave it a shot.There are no negatives here, but rather, a feeling of underwhelm.

These bars are great for sensitive skin. I have used this bar many times before. Does not dry out skin. These bars are in their own packaging, but are then wrapped in Plastic!!!  Shame on you. I have bought these elsewhere and they just come as they are in their original wrapping. I would not have purchased knowing this.

I have very sensitive skin, and this soap is amazing. Going to try more of the companies products.

Great product. I subscribed to get regular delivery. One reason I use this is that it avoids lots of plastic. However the latest delivery came with each bar individually wrapped in a layer of pointless plastic on top of the paper. Horrible. Please change this, or I will stop buying!

I can't say this is a bad product but definitely does not work for my very sensitibe eczema prone skin ... i struggle with eczema around my eyes and mouth area and when i tell ya the burning that i experienced... wooh!!perfect for cleaning my make up cloth though so not a complete loss

Extremely  drying . I dont know why .

Baby's eczema

The soap didn't feel as good as the other ones with organic ingredients. Afterwards my skin got much dried that it usually did.

Please note.  The picture of the Baby Unscented soap is not accurate.  This bar does contain Hemp Oil.

It's good, but not $6 good...I bought this for personal use as an adult just to get away from all the scents and perfumes.Pros:* The soap does indeed rinse clean.  You feel clean and not filmy as with most soaps.Cons:* Price! You would think that a soap without the additives that drive up cost would be less expensive than its peppermint/wintergreen siblings.  However, not so.* Lasts no longer than other commercial soaps.  At this price you would hope that the bar would be denser or longer lasting, but (again) not so. I've had some milled french hotel bar soaps last longer than this bar did.Best uses:* Folks who have skin or allergy issues that are willing to pay a premium price for a soap with no additives.* Hunters who want to be scent-free in the woods.I'm happy with its performance, but its a niche product and not a good value. Cut the price in half and then let's talk. Otherwise, a bar of Ivory is a much better value.

I found this to be easy to lather, an extremely faint smell that dissipates quickly and a touch drying to the skin after use. None of with bother and happy to continue use.

I very much like all bonnet’s soap products, but this particular order may have easily been a mistake but it’s bothersome to pay $50 plus for 12 bars of soap and to only receive 1 bar. 🤦🏽‍♀️

I originally posted a review, warning to be cautious, with first time use. As I had a mild reaction to it. I believe that reaction was caused by the citric acid content.  This reaction was localized to my face and privates and not the rest of my body.However, I tried it on my face again, and had no reaction. I am now using it regularly on everything, and love it.  It is a very mild bar; doesn't dry out my skin, yet still effectively lifts dirt and unwanted excess oil.It holds up well to water as well. Making it a great value. Highly recommended.

Cleans skin well and is not harsh. It has a clean smell, no perfumes.

It still has a bit of a smell, it's not that strong but it's there, maybe I have a sensitive nose. OK for sensitive skin but I have a skin problem and it's still a bit too harsh for me, if you can believe it but I'm still using it, so it can't be that bad. It's more me, not the soap. This is a nice bar of soap over all.

I've used the Dr Bronner liquid soap and really like it so I thought I'd try the bar.  Not disappointed.  Lathers great and rinses clean.  The bar is large so I tried cutting it--didn't work too well as the smaller part broke into pieces.  I use it for washing my face and body.  As with other soaps do not leave it where the water will constantly be on it or your soap will be gone too quickly.  Will be using again.

Perfect for sensitive skin or for lady parts because it’s unscented.

Works as expected. No scent and good for sensitive skin. Does leave a bit of a film on items at times and not very moisturizing.

Great soap.  It doesn't seem to dry out my skin like other commercial brands.  I like the fact that it's made with very simple ingredients and it's perfume free.  I will definitely continue buying this product.

Love this soap! With allergies gallor in my home, we use this soap and never have any issues! I even use it on my 4 year old! Awesome product! Awesome service!

Just another soap. Pricey for what it is.

I love all Dr. Bronners soaps especially this one. It's great for sensitive and oily skin. It doesn't over dry your skin since it's made with oils and it dissolves the dirt as well the oil. All Dr. Bronners soaps will leave you feeling refreshed and clean. I LOVE THEM! Definitely will recommend this product.

Feels sort of slimey while using in the shower. Otherwise a good product.

Nice, but melts quickly.  We had to use a bar just about every 3 days.

Arrived in a timely manner and will buy again.

Does the job, its gentle enough. Was surprised that it foams a lot.

I bought this for my dive mask and it works well

I like this soap, it is much better than all the others.I think I would recommend to other customers. One thing, this soap doesnt make skin of my hand softer.

What can someone say about a bar of soap? It grates well if using it to make home made dish washing liquid

Better than Ivory!

good!

good

I use Aroma Seize Grave Robber soap but ran out so tried this in a pinch. I personally found it super drying.

Love this soap always keeps my face so clean an free from break outs

Husband has very sensitive skin and likes this soap

no scent, would buy again

Soft

Good as soap,not that good as a wood finish.

I've been trying to find a bar alternative to dish washing liquid and this recommended itself. However it's hard work to get really sudsy and then you need to rinse a LOT to avoid smeary dishes. With all the water use it's definitely not the eco fix I was hoping for and with the extra hard work it's not a worth while switch. HOWEVER, it's been nice on my hands so I'm still giving 4 stars

Satisfied

Smells amazing and does wonders

Finally found a product that doesn't give me an allergic reaction! I have weirdly sensitive skin even to completely natural products and even when I find a product that doesn't react with my skin usually if I use it for a while I then become irritated by it, go figure! I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and have had no problems it has also left my skin feeling SUPER soft, very very clean and has been reducing my breakouts massively! It has no smell which is great, the only downside for me personally is when you wash it off it has that not very nice feeling that happens with virtually all bars of soap when your skin gets very grippy (the only way I can explain it) apart from that I will be reccomending this product to everyone I know!

There is no scent which is great for me and it's lovely to use. I prefer the liquid castille version of this soap though.

Ordered several of these to make felted soap as seasonal gifts (product was recommended by a friend ). Perfect for the most sensitive skin, no perfume or strong odour and lather up very well.

Truly fragrance free, which is hard to come by. Great lather and good wash but as i bought it for body and hair, find it a little drying of the scalp.

Very dear product but makes your skin soft ..not sure there is a scent as such

Not sure what the rave about these products are, worked just ask well as normal soap

Soap, it soaps.

Good, but still slightly drying. It's milder than most though.

Good for sensitive skin

Lovely soap , though it can be a bit drying

And this product has helped it to stop being soBothersome.

So many ways to use this soap.  I made oat bags to use in shower on sensitive skin

I absolutely love this soap and it creates a really big lather. It is completely unscented, which was the point of my buying it. I have given this to people who typically like liquid soap and they started using this bar soap instead. Highly recommended.

I love this soap

If you're looking for an awesome soap without harmful ingredients, THIS IS IT! We've been trying to slowly replace healthcare/beauty/cleaning products in our home with alternatives that do not contain bad ingredients and we love these soap bars! They are gentle on our skin (kids included) and wash great without the health concerns that come from some ingredients in most soaps.

Can’t go wrong with bronner’s. Especially when on sale. Needed a neutral smell/ soap and this fit the bill.

Love this soap. Very mild, and best of all, absolutely no scent.

This was my first time ever using any of Dr. bronner's products, but I am definitely in love with the organic baby mild soap. I have the bar soap because I thought it would last longer & be easier to work with (for my specific needs) rather than the liquid soap; however, I would like to also try the liquid baby mild soap. I decided to purchase it to use on my 4 month old son. He has very dry skin & several rough, scaly patches (I believe it may be eczema but he hasn't been medically diagnosed yet) and I brought the soap in hopes that the Castile soap would help his skin retain moisture. At the time I was using Aveeno baby soap & lotion, and I felt that it may have been drying his skin out. So far I've been using dr. bronner's for about a month & and I've definitely noticed a difference in his skin. I've also changed the lotions I use on his skin. Along with using this soap to bathe my son, I also use this soap to scrub out poop stains before putting the clothes in the washer machine. I breast feed & my son has frequent (about 1-3 times per week) blow out diaper messes. When he has a blow out I hand-scrub his clothes in the sink, before putting them in the washer. Dr. Bronner's removes poop stains better than the baby dreft laundry detergent that I use !! It removes the stain phenomenally. And I've never noticed any damages to the color or quality of his clothes' fabric.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this soap for bathing, as well as a clothing stain remover. I look forward to using other Dr. Bronner's products & exploring what other uses they may have.

Love that its healthy and natural

This product is a great product and I recommend to everyone

I am allergic to everything , all scents and well all kinds of soaps . This is my go to , castor oil base unscented baby soap. The lather is abundance and I do not break out ! Close to $5 a bar so when it is on sale at Whole Foods I buy lots of it ! Totally worth it!

Could never go wrong with this product. This brand never disappoints.

I have a lot of piercings. Tons on the ears, a nose, and nipple piercing. You know the confusion around what to use, right? Some say use Dial Gold, others say only salt water, some swear by the H2Ocean spray. I swear that I’ve tried them all and this soap is by far the BEST. After two of my latest piercings, my new piercer recommended Dr. Bronner’s and said don’t fall for the BS products like H2Ocean spray and I wish I listened to him. I’ve dealt with keloids galore but this soap (and only using this) has made the healing process super easy and FAST. The soap goes by a little fast but not as fast as some others I’ve tried like unscented Cetaphil soap bars. From now on I’ll be using it every time I get a new piercing and I think you should too if you’re in the same boat.Also I have eczema and the last few years I’ve only been using unscented soap and this is so nice to my skin and never causes a flair up.

I’ve noticed a big difference in my daughter’s completion. I love this soap.

No nasty chemicals or hazardous ingredients.

I WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING INGROWN HAIRS AFTER WAXING. ONCE I STOPPED USING DOVE SOAP AND STARTED USING THIS SOAP NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS. I AM ALSO USING IT NOW INSTEAD OF THE SCENT FREE HUNTING SOAP I WAS USING

I've used this soap for quite a few years and I really like it.  My skin is pretty fragile because I'm an old lady so this soap is gentle and the scent is very very very slight which I like as well.

I bought this soap to wash my Moreno wool when I was traveling in Spain. Worked out very well.

Unscented and all natural.  Doesn’t dry skin and make you itchy.

I've been using this soap for many years.  Perfect for me.  I will continue to purchase this product.

love it!

I have very sensitive skin and also suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and roseacea. I went through tons of different soaps trying to find one that did not irritate my face. I can't remember where I learned about Dr. Bonner's baby soap, but I'll be forever grateful to the person who suggested I try it. This is the only soap I can use on my face. Just a little tidbit for those who have my skin conditions. This soap comes in both a bar and a liquid form. I can use the liquid on my face (I really like it as a hand soap) but I can only use the bar on my face. If you have trouble with one formula of the soap, maybe try the other to see if one works better for you. After using it on my face, I now use it exclusively for all my personal care cleansing needs. I've used Dr. Bonner's for several years now and just love it!

Been using bronner for several years. Gentle long lasting soap bars, or liquid. Would recommend especially for hard water areas.

No plastic.  Good soap that doesn't dry out your skin and doesn't leave a lasting fragrance.

Purchased for myself and my husband. We both are sensitive to soaps and this is perfect.  Great quality and nice size bars.

The bar of soap is very firm .I have very sensitive skin and react  to Dove  brand soap , but not to this one.Also, it is much firmer than the dove soap bars

Unscented, great for people with allergies. Not drying either. I know it's pricey, but I can always depend on its quality, and the bar soap lasts a long time. I buy it again and again, and I don't give out 5 stars lightly.I have serious reactions to perfumes (maybe dyes too), but this never causes my skin to itch, and it does not cause skin irritation or inflammation. LOVE Love love this soap. Ty for a great product!

I had been looking for more natural soap options and this seemed to be a common and popular choice, so I bought a bar to try out. In my opinion, it was a fairly large bar. The first time I used it, I liked it. It felt wonderful on my skin, washed off well, and left me feeling clean, soft and smooth. Not dried out at all. I kept running my hands over my arms because they felt so great.Even though this is an unscented soap, it does have what I would call a typical soap smell to it. It's not unpleasant, quite nice, and I assume the 'unscented' means they didn't add any scent to it, so you're just getting the natural smell of the ingredients. It makes no difference to me, but if you want a product that actually has no smell, this won't be it.The bar is lasting a good while compared to what I'm used to. It's a pretty hard bar, not soft like some of them that seem to wash half away the first time you use it. I've taken many showers with the same bar, and still have many to go.I think this is a great soap, and I will definitely be buying more. I will probably also try some of Dr. Bronner's other varieties.

Good product, fast service, what’s better than that?

My skin is cray sensitive and this has been a lifesaver! Great soap works well!

Have had allergic reactions to so many soaps,  this is the only soap that leaves me feeling clean and no allergic reaction.

I LOVE this soap. I only get the unscented . Since discovering this item I refuse to use any other soap. It has been amazing with restoring my ph health. Such a shame the price keeps increasing on it but worth the buy.

Works

I purchased these bars for camping.  Microwave one bar for 30 seconds, flip over and repeat.  This makes the bar soft enough to slice smoothly with a sharp knife while being firm enough to handle with your hands.  I sliced the bar along the short side, then cut those pieces in half to make soap chips.  When I send a family member to the shower house, they get a chip to wash their hands (most state & national parks do not have soap in the restrooms).This soap is free of additives and is kind to the 3 people in my family who have eczema and/or sensitive skin.  It can be used for hand, body, or face soap, as well as to wash clothes, dishes or your hair!

Long time Dr B fan and initially purchased this item after destroying my hands from washing them many many times a day with other brands. This soap already has some moisture in it and get this, does not and will not dry out your hands - ymmv of course but so definitely worth trying (and hopefully falling in love with as much as one can fall in love with a bar of soap.) be well

Item arrived on time in excellent condition.

My OBGYN told me to stop using feminine wash because is causes issues. She told me to use unscented baby wash. After doing some research I ordered this Dr. Bronner's unscented bar soap. This is my favorite soap! i have very sensitive skin and this is exactly what I needed. This is the best soap I've ever used. I use it on my whole body and it deep cleans while remaining gentle. I wish I would've found this sooner. This is the only bar soap I'll buy. I usually prefer liquid soap but this is way better. I tried Dr. Bronner's almond scented liquid soap and I like it too but it's a bit  watery/runny for me. I use it on my hair before my shampoo & conditioner. Smells good like cherry almond.

The only soap I used on my skin for years. Have recommended this soap to others.

I’ve had problems with acne since I was a teenager. I have very oily skin and this is the FIRST soap that has worked and kept my face/body acne free. I’m on my second bar and usually by now I’d have a breakout but NOTHING not a blemish. This is the only soap I will use especially since it works for both my face and body.  My showers aren’t nearly as long now. I wish I would’ve known about this soap years ago would’ve saved me from spending ridiculous amounts of money.

I just Love this product and works very well. Thank you

Used for bathing my baby/toddler. Lots of foams and easy to wash off.

I ordered this product on August 22 specifically to use as a diluted spray on my outdoor plants to kill Japanese beetles.  I received the product today, September 21st.  (almost a full month delay).  There are now only a few beetles here and there so the product is basically worthless to me for the intended purpose.  I have used this soap in the past as a soap product and was satisfied, but due to the long delay in receiving my order I am not giving this particular product a good review.

The worst soap we've ever bought. we can't believe there are so many reviews tp talk good about it. The smell is not good at all. The most important thing is it's like oil not soap. There is no foam. Instead, it will stick on your skin with oilly feeling. Want to use it for body wasb? No. Want to use it as shampoo? Definitely no. My hairs feel horrible while using it and after. Want to use it as dish soap? No! It doesn’t clean at all. I read the reviews and bought 2 bottles of soap and tooth paste. This bottle was for my newborn baby. But I’m sooo glad I tried it before using on her. It’s awful! The tooth paste is no good either. Why did these people write so many good reviews?!? I really can’t understand. Stay away from Dr. bronner’s.

No, the product itself is not 100% organic. Dr. Bronners, as an organization, is certified by Oregon Tilth; however, that designation does not mean that all products that they produce are 100% organic. This is why the label does not clearly state that it is organic nor does it bear the required USDA Organic insignia. (Note: if you scroll down into the product description, you’ll see a close-up image of the USDA Organic insignia but this is fake - See the actual product label from Dr. Bronner’s website which does NOT bear such insignia). The label instead accurately reflects “Made with organic oils” which is the legally-acceptable language for cosmetic labeling when a product contains some ingredients but is not entirely organic.

I bought this bottle not realizing I could get 32oz at target for $14. I can't believe amazon has the audacity to charge $18 for 8oz. I want my money back lol the product is good though, just save your money and go to target instead

Once "the gripping" tape was off the bottle, the lid was broken and  the bottle just sits open, a big spill hazard.  We like the soap. I have used Dr Bronners for years, but this is the largest bottle I have purchased and to have the lid busted right off the bat is very disappointing.Why has no one addressed this issue of broken lid?!? From the reviews I see I am not the first. Makes me reluctant to ever order this again!How hard would it be to KEEP customers and increase good will by sending a new lid?

I mistaken bought the 8 0z instead of the 16 oz or even the 32 oz and it cost me dearly. The 8 oz cost me about $1.62 oz! Ouch! Otherwise it is a great product for people with sensitive skin!

I'm not happy with this soap, its water down already like it was spilled and had water added, the bottle wasn't full, because its so runny it clogs the soap dispenser easily and I shot myself in the eye, worst burn from soap ever. Not worth the cost.. I always use castile soap but this brand,  never again

I know lots of people say how wonderful this soap is which is why I chose to go ahead and buy a big bottle for over $16. I figured that with all the good reviews, I'd love it. Not...at...all.  It's as thin as water so makes an awful shower soap and when I got out of the shower, I felt as sticky and nasty as if I'd used an old bar of Dial or something. Dr. Bronner obviously has a large following, but unless I can find a non-skin use for this big bottle of watery soapy stuff, I'm out $16 because it will probably cost me half of that just to return it.

There is an ingredient or ingredients in this product that I can not handle. Not sure which ones, but I can't stand the smell and after trying it on my hands, it was hard to wash it off afterwards. I can not use this. It might be fragrance free, but the other ingredients are not something I can use, that's for sure.

DO NOT use it for skin. It clogs the.pump regularly and will shoot in unexpected angle. This time it gets into my baby girl's eyes, she cried like hell. How could that be? So I put some in my eyes.Oh my god, it's extremely extremely extremely irritating to eyes, I can barely open my eyes for 5 mins and continue irritating me for almost 30 mins after washing. How could such product use for skin????1 star?? I wish it has -5 rating...

I got this product for my 14 months old baby girl as a body and hair soap but this this shampoo irritated my daughter's eyes like 4 days after start using it. I dont recommend this shampoo. She doesnt want to take a shower now, she used to loved it. I have to take her to the doctor to make sure everything is fine with her eyes.

Super water-downed! Very disappointed, especially since I paid so much for this product. Here is a picture comparison of another bottle I have from a different company vs. this new bottle I just received. I will NOT be ordering from this company again.

I bought this product for washing dishes and am not too happy.  Perhaps because of contained oil, the dishes are oily after the wash and I do not like the oily wax feel it leaves on the hands.  Always left with feeling dishes are unclean.  Will not buy it again.

I used this in the shower and after using about a palm size amount, I didn't feel clean at all! In fact, I didn't even smell clean, I smelled the same until I used it two more times and I smelled a little bit cleaner. Pours out like oil and then when washed away, leaves skin feeling a bit tight. May not be suitable for all skin types!!

First order, cap to product was broken.  Returned and replacement sent.  Same thing for the second one.  Box was not damaged.  The cap for the product was broken.

I have heard rave reviews about this product. Unfortunately for me, I was unable to use the product. When it arrived to my home the bottle was cracked. It had leaked all over the other items that I had ordered. Needless to say I was disappointed. One would think that a company that ships liquid would take more care in packing. Although it may cost a little more, I will older directly from Dr. Bronner's. Surely they know how to package their product.

It works just fine, but the reason for 1 star is the creepiness of the writing that's all over it! It gave me the chills when I read it, it just felt Satanic...Yes, it talks about God, but in a really strange way, that feels anti-God. Definitely something that I as a Christian want to stay away from. Would never buy this kind again. Dr. Wood's is much more conscience-friendly! :)

I have used every scented Dr. Bronners products and this by far has the worst smell.The smell made me throw away the bar soap and liquid.

I’ve bought castle soap before at Walmart . But decided to order this time . Not happy with product . Doesn’t feel like the same , very watery. As if it’s been watered down . I don’t even think this is castle soap . Very disappointed 🤨

I have sensitive skin but fairly moisturized and this dried me out. Maybe that’s just me but I don’t like that feeling.

opened the package to find the cap had broken off and the seal came off and it had emptied out in the mailing bag

The product worked great. But I would not have bought it had I known this company would use their label to push their political opinions. All over the label they are pushing for the minimum wage to be increased. I believe a company should not push their political opinions on their customers.

The entire bottle is covered in liberal political messages. If I knew I was paying to distribute political propaganda I wouldn't have purchased it. Oh and the soap was disappointing as well. Very runny. Not near the quality or richness I was expecting for such an expensive bottle of soap.

Very bad lid, I arrived spilled almost in half

Wanted to buy soap but received a bottle with nothing but political messages all over it. I sent it back. My hiking and hunting is Apolitical. I am guessing that everyone but me knew about their agenda but me. Not interested in reading their political message every time I refill my soap containers.

I was wanting tea tree, how I ended up with this I'm not sure. I can't find what I originally ordered. This is absolutely wrong, I ordered a tea tree body soap unscented for babies.  And I ended up with this. I didn't want this, I wanted the tea tree with no scent to help a dog with yeast. God I'm mad.

The bottle came with a broken lid. Obvious problems: dirt/dust can get inside, if it falls it will make a mess, if I tilt it too much it will spill, etc....not so much a problem with the soap but its container.

Unfortunately, I am allergic to one or more of the ingredients. I ended up seeing my doctor for a severe case of eczema. No-one else in my family had a reaction, but I have extremely sensitive skin. Just a heads up for others who has very sensitive skin.

Fine as a cleaner,  terrible experience after my 5yo got some in his eye.  Too strong, burned horribly.  Fine for laundry or general cleaning, but I will never understand why this is marketed as a baby soap.Went in the garbage.

The top broke and it spilled in the box.

Seal was broken on bottle - soap there is but seems thin and watered down

Very disappointed the product came with the cap broken and the seal open .

The full bottle is the one I just received, it is a total different color compared to my other bottle. The new one is white in color and has a ton of bubbles in it.

Not sure its the real deal , Just ordered from Dr Bronner's web site to do a comparison. I am in agreement with some of the one star rating reviews. Will be back in touch for follow up.

I have purchased Kichler products before bathroom fixtures, this product is very disappointing. One of the shades was completely bent out of shape upon opening the box could bend it back to so-so with my bare hand without much effort. Very cheesy product not worth the money.

Just recieved it, only using on hoyseplants for gnats.  Just started to use, too early to see if it works or not

I will not be using Dr Bronners products any longer. This was just like the conditioner they make and it just does not work. The liquid is so thin it would not even create a little lather. And it simply did not clean period.

Misleading product. You'd think something listed as "baby" would be tear free. This is not. Thank God I used it on myself before my infant!

I don’t support companies that push their political and religious views on consumers through their products, I’ll be returning this soap.

This was advertised as SHAMPOO on the Amazon site from which I purchased it. This is NOT shampoo. It is detergent that strips the hair like dishwashing detergent. Horrible stuff. And--for the record--I have virgin, untreated hair!

MY ARMPITS ARE BURNING! SOS! MAKE IT STOP! -Bri C.

Always order unscented baby pure castile soap, but unfortunately received peppermint. Very disappointed since I had to place a new order and wait even longer for delivery.

Rough on skin and not tear- free. Advertised for a baby. I won't use it on people. I'm going to try it on the dog. I hate to throw it out!

Arrived with Broken seal

Not good for baby bottles / dish washing

Does not get sudsy in the bath and leaves residue. Unfortunately first dr. Bronner's product I didn't love. After 3 weeks, I've retired the unused portion of the bottle to the bathroom closet.

I absolutely cannot support what this company believes. I will not purchase again.

I've been using it for hand soap in my bathroom and I've never seen so much soap scum. You have to wash your sink every time you use it or it's disgusting. Not worth it.

Takes too much soap to feel like it's doing anything, and left a dirty film on my Daughter's baby bottles/bottle parts/nipples.

I used it for hands and it makes my skin very dry..... not sure yet why everyone likes this soap.... maybe will use it for cleaning.

I wanted to love this soap just because the label is such fun to read. I bought Dr. Bronner's "Baby Unscented" Pure-Castile Soap because I wanted to make my own foaming hand soap. It actually creates a great, light foamy hand soap when used with the
InterDesign Foaming Soap Dispenser Pump, for Kitchen or Bathroom Countertops- Clear/Chrome
(less than 1/5 liquid soap to 4/5's water).I got some sweet orange and lemon grass essential oils to scent it with. Loved the texture of the foam, however I found the dispensed soap had an underlying unpleasant scent. I assumed it must be the mixture of the two citrus oils and, not wanting to waste the entire contents, I tried to put up with it for about a week before I finally decided to dump it and try the sweet orange essential oil, which I really love, by itself for scenting the soap. After making up a second mixture, I was disappointed to discover the foam still had the same unpleasant underlying scent.I got the bottle of Dr. Bronner's out and took a sniff - and found the source of the unpleasant odor. The soap itself smells akin to rancid vegetable oil. Not surprising, I guess, considering all of the oils that go into making it (coconut, palm kernel, olive, hemp, jojoba).With all of the good reviews, I have to assume that I just got a bad or "old" batch of Dr. Bronner's "Unscented", but at almost $20. for a 32oz bottle, I really don't want to take the chance on another purchase of the same. Though it makes a great foaming soap, it leaves my hands smelling like rancid vegetable oil so, as far as I'm concerned, it's unusable. But, I love the quirky label and that earned it an additional star.

I am still trying to figure this shampoo out, but so far am not convinced. I really wanted to love it since it is organic and made in USA, etc.Anyway, I tried washing my hair with it and first noticed that it smelled like the soap they used to supply for us in the public elementary schools when I was growing up. After applying some to my hair in the shower, it made my hair feel squeaky clean, but when I got out and started blow drying, my usually fine limp hair was thick, oily and almost gooey - I could hardly get a brush through it as I was blow drying! It felt like sheep's wool (for those familiar) - I had no idea what to do! I ended up having to rewash my hair in the sink after trying a little too long to dry it flat. Then of course I was late for work with hair that was still not quite behaving... I'll try to use it for other applications and see how it goes, but so far, am disappointed.

Although it is supposed to be unscented... it is not. There is a very distinct and strong odor to it that must be covered up by some kind of essential oil. The smell was definitely unexpected, especially because it is described as unscented. I grated Kirk's Castile soap bars and turned them into a more liquid soap (fyi Kirk's soap bars hardens into jello if diluted/melted) and that has almost no smell besides a light soapy scent. I don't have a sensitive nose, I promise.I was using my Kirk's solution with honey, lemongrass essential oil, and glycerine for face wash. Because it hardens, I decided to bite the bullet and get Dr. Bronner's liquid soap. Even with extra honey and extra lemongrass (the oil was so strong it began to sting my face), the smell was still very noticeable. I couldn't use it on my face anymore. So I tried to use what I had left as body soap. I couldn't use that either.

I diluted the wash per the instructions and it became very watery -so it wasn't very concentrated to start with. I also don't like the drying feeling left on my hands after using it. I probably won't buy it again.

I bought this because I hate using chemicals in soaps but currently need to avoid essential oils, which rules out Burts Bees.1. The product price is good2. It cleans3. It blocks dispenser pumps within an hour of use, and if you don't remember to clear the blockage immediately before the next use, you'll get sprayed thanks to all the product being forced through the tiny hole that remains unclogged.  I've had my entire outfit, top and bottom, stained (it does come out in the wash, thankfully) by this issue.  I've had the whole bathroom mirror squirted with the stuff, and the kitchen counter, my cell phone, etc.  If you don't clean it all up right away, it becomes a solid and is very hard to scrape off.I've noticed people are using it with the foaming pumps so am springing $11 to try that solution.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I like this product and buy it often but it arrived with a broken top so once it’s opened, I won’t be able to successfully close it.

I guess this works okay as a liquid castile soap, even lathers a little. BUT this product is supposed to be unscented and it definitely is NOT! It has a very strong disgusting smell to it. But you like to think that maybe it just smells that way in the bottle and that if you bathe with it than surely it should be fine and the smell wash off with the water, but no. My husband and I washed our baby in this and my mom held her afterwards and had an asthma attack because of the strong smell of this stuff, and the smell only came off when baby was washed off with something else. If you want something without a smell or that smells good or you have asthma, than you should definitely keep looking. Very disappointing.

I bought this for my family thinking it was a gentle soap (we have dry, sensitive skin) . After using just a few times, my hands feel more dry than they were before. I thought this was supposed to be a gentle soap?? After doing some research, I found that in order to actually be 100% castile soap, it should be made from 100% olive oil. Seems that companies started making "Castile Soap" from other vegetable oils because they are cheaper.

I had been a Dr. Bronner's advocate for over six years because I was under the impression that all ingredients were 100% natural... until now! Potassium hydroxide has now been added as an ingredient (although I am certain that this has always been an ingredient and that they are now obligated to disclose this truth). Never the less, I will be returning this product and ending my business with Dr. Bronner's. Very disappointed.

As expected but I used as a shampoo and it literally burned my scalp. Way to harsh for me to wash with. Also, it leaves hair just crunchy and dry. I have had a lot of hair breakage after using this just 2 times. Wont buy again... but will now use the rest that was in the bottle for cleaning. Thats all..

I like the product but the bottle top was completely shattered when it arrived and had leaked all over the box.  I couldn't get a refund unless I was willing to ship back a broken, leaky bottle.

Used it once and it was irritating my todler's eyes. I had to remove it right away. I tried to start using it, but the after the first use my skin felt dry. Now my husband is using it as hand soap. 😐

I've used the Lavender and the Peppermint, and I thought that surely the unscented would have a very bland smell, possibly a slight coconut or hemp oil smell... WRONG! IT SMELLS LIKE A DIRTY FRIED CHICKEN JOINT

Glad to have a natural product, but it’s very drying, even when greatly diluted. My son gets eczema and this really made it much worse as well.

The first time I purchased it was okay, Thick liquid soap that didnt foam much. This time its watery so I dont know which it is supposed to be.

Works great without dangerous chemicals but bummed to find out it was made with palm oil.

Doesn’t smell great. We stopped using it and switched to Aveeno

came in broke and spilled and they charged me for return shipping.

Sudsy, which is a plus. However, too harsh for my baby's eyes.

Very  drying to my skin

I bought this product to make homemade soaps. It cleans well, but stinks to high heaven! Won't be purchasing again.

Didn't really help the cradle cap (what we'd heard it was good for). Expensive and very large - waste of money

I expected it to be much more gentle. It dried my skin out and burned my eyes if I used it on my face

Can't really remember why I ordered this

This did not work well for me, but my son has dandruff and he likes it.

Skin feels sticky after wash .... Don't really care for this soap

It dried my skin out badly making me very itchy, even when i watered it down half way with bottled water, tried watering it down more but it always makes my skin feel dry and itchythe only thing i liked about the soap was that its fragrance free and dye free but won't be using it on my body, only use it to wash my hands now to avoid overly perfumed products and dyesWorks great to wash hands but not so much for my whole body, drys me out badlyWill stick to Aveeno Unscented body wash for bathing

Stung our 3-year-old's eyes every single time. Also stung our infant's eyes every single time. Granted, the label warns to not get it in the eyes, but that's inconsistent with branding something as "baby" and "mild." Deceptive marketing, as we couldn't read the label until it arrived.

I bought this to clean makeup brushes, but I diluted this to wash my face, when I did not have the bar soap version. If you have dry skin like me, then don't use this on your face. My face felt stripped of moisture. It does have a slight fragrance, which burned my nose. I must be allergic to something in this, but it should be fine for most people. Like any soap, this burns if you get it too close to your eyes. It cleaned my synthetic makeup brushes well, but I don't think I will use it anymore. Luckily, I bought this in a much smaller bottle, so I won't feel badly about tossing it.

I have been using this form about 4 months and only now am I realizing it was giving me back acne. I never suffered from acne before this soap. It's been about 1 week now since I stopped using it and almost all the acne on my back has disappeared. I give it three stars because is natural but other than that 0 stars.

Good soap. Wished this man kept his heresy to himself so will not be buying this again.

This is in no way castile soap!!! it is a good soap but it is sold as castile soap and it is not!! Castile soap by definition is soap made from OLIVE OIL and LYE that is it.

I do not like the smell at all or the texture it leaves behind.

Pros:- Extremely concentrated- Effective for household tasks- Good for oily/combination skinCons- Extremely liquid- Doesn't react well to salt as a thickening agent- Made from palm oilWouldn't recommend as a body wash since it's so liquid that you have to be extremely careful not to drop it all in the shower when using it.Also, I thought this would be an environmentally friendly soap, but the second ingredient on the list is the infamously unsustainable palm kernel oil which I'm boycotting.

Although I do enjoy the Dr. Bronner's soaps for a number of uses, I do not find them to be the best choice for healthy skin. My reason for a 3-Star rating is not because I consider this to be a poor product, but rather because I think it is promoted as a moisturizing, balancing skin cleansing option when it is not. This duly noted, plenty of people will use it and have no problem whatsoever - but this is the case with nearly any product we look at. In the case of liquid Castile soaps, these soaps perform the duty of cleansing in a very serious way. Any product that can effectively clean your floors, dishes, laundry, etc. and also doubles as a skin cleansing agent - may just turn out to be somewhat too harsh on skin. I love the fact that this soap is easily used as a base to carry lovely fragrances, and it is definitely affordable. However, for people who struggle with any dry skin concerns, this soap is far too detergent in nature to be used on a daily basis, and as a licensed esthetician, I advise against its use as a daily soap for body or face. If you do plan to use this for body, please do dilute. Full strength Castile soap is far too stripping for the skin. The skin is a living organ with a delicate pH balance and natural fats that are important to keeping it soft and supple. Cleansers that effectively remove "everything" remove all the "good things" too. Again, this is a great soap to play with, to make interesting concoctions with, and although many people swear by it, I have it to be far too drying and the source of patchy, itchy dry skin far too often.

I've always been advised to wash my CPAP mask with a mild soap but my providers could never recommend one.  I was using dishwashing liquid which is not really mild.  I'd discovered Bronner's via a search on Amazon and remembered happy days about 50 years ago when I loved showering with the peppermint Bronner's!  I use unscented for my CPAP equipment.  And I apparently wrote that a few days ago before I wanted to use it!  (I have memory problems.) NEW INFO;  I don't remember if the bottle was shrink wrapped or what, but it wasn't spilling.  I put it in my bathroom and when I went to use it, discovered that the flip top had been torn off, and I didn't do it.  There's a hole in the screw on top lid to get the soap out, but no top of that lid to flip down over the hole.  Two problems w/ that.  Arthritis and I drop things. Soap spills when it's open.  Also,  If you don't put the "lid" down, the soap will congeal and stop up the hole out of which the soap is dispensed.  So I will be spending a lot of time with a pin and hot water trying to clear it.  I suspect that someone returned it???  After breaking off the lid that closes down over the hole?  And so I got resold as it was?  I should get a free bottle.

Price : Pricey taking in consideration that is a very simple soap formula ( old fashion style )Quality : GreatUses: I personally use it to wash my baby clothe and leaves the clothe soft ( no need fabric softener) & clean ( takes dirt easily )Scent : soft - very neutral which is great so I can enjoy the natural smell of my baby skin.Negative : is harsh on my hands so I need to use gloves as I wash baby clothe by hand but no problem for the washing machine.I will keep using it until I find a cheaper version but same quality .-2 stars : first as other reviews said : packaging is not versatile and it came broken and it spilled inside of the box . Second : too harsh on my hand so I don't recommended it for sensitive skin.NOT FOR DELICATE SKIN I WOULD NEVER WASH MY BABY OR MYSELF WITH THIS SOAP but amazing for washing clothe .ADVISE for MANUFACTURER:- Ad some protective packaging for the caps so it won't break.

Love this soap. I’ve used it for awhile and my dad recently got ahold of it, so I bought him a bottle for his birthday (lol). Unfortunately arrived with a broken cap. I guess I’ll give it to him since I don’t have time to send it back for a replacement, but sucks that it came this way.

For soap: Dr. Bronner's is great. I use it for so many things and I love it. Dr. Bronners soap gets 5 stars. But I purchased this specific one because it says it's unscented, and I like to mix my own soap mixes and essential oils for various scents. So I figured unscented would be the way to go. It's not overpowering of a scent, I couldn't even describe a particluar scent: but it's overpowering in another way where most of my essential oil scents get blended right out with this. I can mix essential oils with Dr. Bronners lavender: and end up with a beautiful smell, not even lavender: because of adding my own oils. For some reason, this one however just unscents everything right out. Sure, I could use a crazy amount of EO's but they are expensive, plus that much oil adding messes up the compound of whatever it is I'm making. Still works as Dr. Bronners soap is expected, just disapointing that it's overpoweringinly "un-scented."

The product is great, of course, no complaint.  But how the seller send it out has a little bit of a problem.  The cap was broken.  I wouldn't write a review about it if it was the first time, but the last time I ordered with the same seller, it came broken, too.  It may not be a big deal, but I use this every day, so it gets a bit annoying when it doesn't close right every time I use it. I hope they'll do something about it.

I have had very oily skin and have tried dozens of products. This cleans my skin completely without drying. BUT!!! This is still a caustic soap.  It is made with potassium hydroxide and has a pH of 9.7 when mixed with water. If I were to use it on a baby I would not get it in their eyes. If I do not rinse it off quickly my face feels prickly. It does remove oil completely.  With this Castile soap, all of the oil is gone without drying...just rinse quickly.  It also removes oily substances from anything, like another reviewer stated about breast milk. Anything you wash is squeaky clean.Another positive is that it is a fair trade product. I own a small coconut farm in the Philippines for the purpose of supporting two families who work it. Farmers cannot earn a living selling copra (dried coconut meat) at market prices. Fair trade gives them a FAIR price.

I like the product.  I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this soap has really helped my skin clear up.  It has simple ingredients and is cheaper than other natural soaps we have used in the past.That being said, I was really disappointed in this shipment.  The box arrived yesterday without a dent in it, but when I opened it I found the top flap of the cap missing, soap leaked out, and a pink residue on top of the soap bottle (I’m guessing the soap mixed with the cardboard?).  The missing piece of the cap is nowhere to be found in the box, so it must have been packed that way.

I'm on the fence with this product. While I like the soap for cleansing my infant, washing out her cloth diapers, and washing my hands with it, it ruined my wipe warmer. After only being in the warmer for a few hours it emits a horrible stench. I actually couldn't figure out what it was until I stopped using the soap. Then it became obvious what the problem was. Also I couldn't find the ingredients anywhere, there's so much Bible Babble on the label, I couldn't find the ingredients. It is covered in biblical crap. Face Palm

I bought this product to use in making my own soap.  It isn't a bad product, but it isn't the best product for me.  The reason being that it severely dries out my skin.  Even when I put only a small amount of this soap into a recipe for face or body wash.  I do not have dry skin, yet this product turns my skin into alligator looking skin.  I wanted to love this soap so much!  Yet, even though this soap doesn't work for me, it does work well for other so thus I give it 3 stars.  I wouldn't purchase again, but I would recommend this for those that really want to use a safe gentle soap (just cause it didn't work well for me, doesn't mean it won't work well for you).

I’m new to using Castile soaps (like last 3-4 months) one thing to note if your new is this soap does NOT suds up but it does work great in making your own foaming hand soap. I’ve tried 2 Castile soap brands, one doesn’t seem better than the other, they both leave my hands feeling a little dry after I use them so I add vitamin E oil to my soaps, seems to help a little with the dry feeling. I would buy this product again even though it feels odd

Bottle arrived damaged, specifically the lid is completely busted, am extremely lucky it didn't all leak out into the packaging, have yet to try the soap, but I'm sure the soap is going to be great

I am only giving it 3 stars for the horrid packaging. I received the box and it was dripping soap out of it, it was a big mess in my kitchen, and when I opened it I saw that the cap was completely broken and won't close now. Other than that, the soap is unscented and suds up nicely in the homemade body wash I made out of it.

I remember when Dr. Bronners' formulation was extra gentle, but now this body wash, marketed to be used with babies, leaves a burning sensation when used on my genital area. It claims to not be scented or to use menthol oil - which leads me to ask what, in this case, is causing the burning? My husband and I don't use this on the baby and frankly don't use it on ourselves, either. This is a disappointment.

It was not good for my psoriasis...

I’ve been using this soap for a year now and I love it. I just bought two bottles and I’m questioning whether one bottle is the right product. The soap in one bottle is the standard tan color but the soap in the other bottle is white. Was I sent the right product?

Dr. Bronner's soap itself gets five stars; the price should get 1. I found this same bottle (which I bought on Prime for $20) at Village Foods for $16 and HEB for $13.The soap it creamy, though harsh. I mixed it with raw honey and essential oils to make body wash for myself and my family. It's cheaper, safer, and way better for our country home's septic system than body wash or bar soap.

Love that this is safe, organic & green & it works well on the skin (face/body/hand wash) but it leaves the same soap residue on the tub (after using as a body wash) that ivory bar soap does. It's decent as a cleaner too. I dilute as instructed in a spray bottle & use on counters, vanities & tub.

I got this because it was recommended for rosacea as it is very gentle on the skin. However I do have a strange tingling/burning when I use it. It does dry my skin out. However the bottle is huge and it can be used for many cleaning needs

Not good if you have hard water. It leaves a milky film that is very visible on glass. It leaves a greasy appearance.I have used it in other places without hard water and it worked very well.

This works alright as soap, but I don't think it was right for my skin. I found it too drying, which I already struggle with.

NO SCENT, LATHERS WELL, USE SPARINGLY IT SEEMS TO LEAVE A HEAVY FEEL IF YOU USE TOO MUCH SOAP

Love the Dr. Bronner's products! I was very excited to get such a large bottle for a fair price. I was just disappointed that it came with a broken top and slightly loose seal so there was leakage.

I like it because it is naturalI dont like it because it lets my sons skin super dryNo smellNo chemicals

The bottle is COVERED in nonsensical, disjointed, religious ranting. It is seriously weird. The soap itself is ok. I've used it a few times and it gets the job done. Overall, I will never purchase this again though because I'm SO creeped out by the psychotic babbling all over the label.

This is my first time using castile soap but i love it. Works great for cleaning and I love that its an all natural option to use with my essential oils.

Top came broken.

Good

Excited to have this product, but the lid was broken off when received making it hard to open from top without taking big lid off.

Made baby laundry soap.

Supposed to be unscented, but has a stronger plain soap smell than I anticipated. My baby didn't have that clean smell at all after bath. Good clean soap, though. But need another soap for better smell.

Arrived broken....

gunks up my hair as a shampoo unfortunately - my hair is gangly and greasy after each use. Also leaves my sink really gunky as a dish soap.

Just okay. Expected more. Used for shampoo, bath gel, hand soaps, and dries out my skin. I have normal skin too...not normally sensitive to anything in particular.

I bought this to make foaming handsoap however, it leaves marks on my sink.  I will find another use for it as it has lots of suds.

The soap product works _GREAT_; however, the packaging and over zealous religious tons were undesirably introduced into my house with this product. Maybe there needs to be an aethist or simple plain label re-branding of this entire product line?

Cleans ok. Eco sensitive pitch if that’s important to you.

The product is ok but smells horrible. Even when adding essential oils, it still smells terrible. Very watery as well. Not what I was looking for.

I know Castile soap is revered all over the world, but I don't like the residue left behind. I don't like how it cleans, though.

I like Dr BonnersBonners for cleaning around the house. It's too drying imo to be used directly on the skin especially on babies.

Glad I received the product but not to happy about the cap being broken when I opened the box. :(

I bought this because it was gluten free and tree nut free. Works very well, but leaves hair and body dried out.

I bought this to wash my hair, but I think it smells funny (soapy?). I'm now using it for handwashing. It lathers well, even at 50/50 dilution.I probably wouldn't buy it again (expensive).

Bought to use with neem oil as a spreader.  Probably can mix with other pesticides for the same purpose.

Didn't like this at all.didn't seems to clean. It's think and seems to leave a residue.

Hate it! I'm using it to wash my Hands now... Makes my skin (and so my baby skin) dry...not appropriate for a baby

This soap, like most others, leave me itchy.  Otherwise, I like it.

Burns if you have a cut or soon rash

Product cover was damaged when received.

I love this product ans I use it for my hand soap. The only thing is that it's gone up 5 dlls more in 15 months.

This 32oz has lasted me (on my own, no sharing) for over a full year and I didn't even dilute it. So that's pretty good. I used it for showers and for cleaning socks. Next time around I plan on going for a different scent. "Baby Mild" has been okay, it's pretty neutral if not kind of gross. Next time with a different scent, I'll perhaps dilute it so my supply so it will last even longer (more value!). Think about the price I paid, (18) divided over a year... that's a pretty good value already. I always use vitamin E moisturizer directly after using it on skin, but even when I didn't, I didn't have problems. This soap is always good (and natural).If there was one thing I could change, what would it be?:Easy. The cap. Only a month or so after using this bottle, it fell and the cap was destroyed. This was very sad because I was unable to find a replacement cap anywhere at home. So I went "capless" until I was able to transfer the remaining soap into a new container.Anyways, I don't plan on ever using a different soap for showers ever again. This s*** is pretty great.

So glad to find a product to help my sons sensitive skin.  I like the unscented so  I can mix with essential oils for a therapeutic soap.  My son uses it mixed with EO for his acne.  My only down fall is I am use to soap that is sudsy and this soap is not real sudsy.  I am sure that is part of the product line.  I will get use to the fact that you don't have to have sudsy foamy soap to be a good product.  Use on face, body and hair.  Loving it.  Just took time to get use to the change.

We use this soap to wash our hands and as an alternative to harsh cleaning products. With only a little elbow grease it cleans the bathroom great and I never have to worry about accidentally bleaching my clothes or worry about possible residue in my kids' baths. I dilute this to maybe 2 parts soap to 1 part water. With the many ways I use this to clean we really fly through it! The only downside is that it is very drying. I'd never use it to bathe my daughters- or myself.

I couldn't believe all the "Christ is my personal friend" crap on the label. Save it for the church of your choice.I bought this to make insecticidal soap which I haven't gotten around to yet. However, I did use it to clean my hair and it did a fantastic job. About 1/2 teaspoon created a thick lather that cleaned my hair and left it manageable without any sort of rinse product.

Like this. However very drying.

it smells good, is very good for sensitive skin

It's nice to use a soap...not detergent..to wash my hands and bathe with. I continue to be perplexed about how it solidifies and "clogs " the bottle opening and the tip of my sink dispenser. I've managed to squirt my clothes numerous times trying to get the hang of it. The biggest plus is that it doesn't dry out my skin the way supermarket brand "soaps" do.

The product is wonderful! i used this on my 8 month old daughter. Since using this soap all of her dry skin has gone away.  her skin is extremely smooth and her hair has grown ALOT! just be careful, DILUTE with water AND do not put near babies eyes. it is NOT TEAR FREE. other than that i would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Been using this to make my own liquid soap and I love it! Definately have to use a moisturizer of some sorts when you make it, otherwise you'll dry up! I order misting lotion from Violet Flames Gifts (The Ultimate Amber is to die for!!) to add to the soap, along with some Jojoba oil from Leven Rose and vegetable glycerine and EVERYONE keeps asking me where to get my soap!

I'm new to natural cleaning solutions so I have to assume what I don't like is just byproducts of going clean.  The 'clean feel' this leaves is completely different than standard products that rinse off and leave a smooth touch.  This rinses off with a slight oil residue.  And it most definitely has a scent so I will be using essential oils to make it more pleasant.  Will take some adjustments to use in the ways I need it to.  It's so runny I need it thicker and easier to lather so it doesn't just drip off before it does the job.

It's seems impossible to find a dish liquid without citrus in it.  Other problems for me are often tea tree oil and lauryl sulfate.  If a good colloidal silver dish liquid could be made and sold, I would like to try it.  If it weren't for the citrus, however, this is a good product.

It works well and is pretty cost efficient. I add my own essential oil to this to make handsoap. My only issue with it is it has a kind of earth smell or something, which isn't bad but ...Since I am trying to stop using Bath and Body Works soap and use something more natural, the essential oils don't cover up the smell of the soap itself enough (even when using way more than recommended) and so it makes me a little disappointed.

This is great to make your own body washes and hand wash. I add some Castile soap, a carrier oil and whatever essential oils I'm feeling. Cleansing and moisturizing. Most recipes with Castile soap call for adding water, and while I realize it needs to be diluted, but it's already thin so I like to add products (like oil) to make it thicker. It will kind of separate so give it a little shake before using. I put them in pump bottles I bought on Amazon, but you could easily reuse an old hand soap pump!

This soap is incredibly moisturizing. Since I have been using it my eczema has gotten better and I dont really need to even apply lotion afterward. I used it to bathe my dog and it works well with his sensitive skin and his fur looks great. Its soo shiny. The soap is very concentrated and it doesnt take much. The soap says baby mild but I would not recommend using to wash their hair or around their face. I accidentally got it in my eyes once and it burned worse than regular soap.

This is a good product to use but after using it for at least a week, it broke my face out completely so I just stopped using it all together. Overall, it did make my face feel clean but my skin doesn’t like this product.

I'm gradually replacing cleaning products that are filled with toxins with products that I put together myself with as few harsh ingredients as possible. I dilute this castile soap with water and add a few drops of essential oils plus a little coconut oil for moisturizing and voila! Liquid hand soap that does the job, smells great, and doesn't scare me with unpronounceable ingredients. Recommended.

I purchased this product to remove poison ivy oil from my skin to prevent any breakouts.  I am not aware of coming in contact with poison ivy since purchasing it, so I am not sure it will help, or if it is already helping and I just don't know it.  So, the move from "like it" to "love it" has not occurred yet.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the packaging. It constantly clogs up. It would be nice if the centerpiece in the lid extended far enough into the bottle hole to de-clog it upon closing. Otherwise, this is a great product. Several in my family have sensitive skin, and everyone seems to tolerate this. I am a repeat customer, and I plan to purchase more in the future.

have used this, you can smell the olive oil and it smelled a bit ransit. I don't know if it was just me or not.  I am going to try it again and mix some Essential Oils in the hand soap jar and see how it goes.  Hoping it helps.  Other than that, I like the product.

Great mild soap. Not harsh on handsYou MUST dilute, otherwise will clog your soap dispensers and they squirt out all over your clothes!Too expensive here however. It’s $11 in my local store and I’m in NYC!Dr Bronners needs to be on Subscribe & Save!!!

Although I Love this soap and have started using it for Everything from laundry detergent to dish soap to body wash, both of my kids have recently broke out in a rash on their buttcheeks... not sure if it's related yet but going to use it a bit more cautiously.

It works welk but is not concentrated at all. Almost like water compared to others. Get Dr woods instead, better product and price.

The cap was broken. Even-though excellent soap for baby

Dr. Bronner's is a great, wholesome soap product.  They also do a great shop of packaging with NO leaking. Very important.

I reviewed the Almond....I'm new to Castile soap.  I'm not sure it lives up to the hype but I'll keep trying.  I'm a little tired of the Almond smell.  I use almond oil for moisturizer so that surprises me.  I also bought this unscented, so when and if the Almond bottle EVER runs out, I'll probably add essential oil to this and love it.

As described. I used it to wash my plants for the winter. Worked well to remove bugs and grime.

I wouldn't use it on a baby. It is not tear free and not mild enough.Great for everything else

Next time I am getting the scented one. Even though I used essential oil (wild orange0 to scent this soap (I made my own shampoo) I can still smell the uncounted scent. Weird I know... other then this I like the soap. Oh yeah it does burn the eyes so I won't use it on my kids. maybe the one for babies is better?

Love it! Our whole family uses this soap and a few drops goes a long way!!One star off because it is not really "tear-free". It burns like the Dickens, actually. So be aware.

Best soap ever. I love it and a little goes a long way.

I was expecting more out of this liquid soap. Was not as thick and creamy as I thought it should be.Instead I put some essence oils along with vitamin E. And made my own ( much better) concoction.

This is a Good Cleansing Soap, definitely gets you clean...

Product arrived with broken cap

This product is great for plants and washing dogs. I just wish that the consistency was a little thicker. That’s why this is 4 stars instead of 5.

Not exactly what I was hoping for but ok

Good

I initially bought this to make shampoo but my hair doesn't seem to like it as much as glycerin soap. I will continue to use this for hand soap, possibly as dish soap someday and maybe even as laundry detergent. It is versatile. Doesn't bubble as much as I like.

I use have been using this was on my daughter since she was born. She is now 9 weeks. Leaves her skin soft and clean. No dryness or irritation. Since it is not tear free I don't use it on her head (I get nervous).

Need to get another one in the future.

Dr Bonner's soap is great. I add a few things to it like vanilla essential oil for smell . I put it in a foaming pump with water to make it last longer and use it as shampoo and body wash. My hair has never been softer and my scalp and skin feel great!

I love all of Dr Bronners  products. I wish there was a better guide on how to dilute property. I think I always use to much. This is great for sensitive skin. Wish I could get the 1/2 gallon size at Amazon.

Wow this is strong soap! It has lots of uses too. It was just a lot runnier than I expected (like water) so it's hard to use sometimes. Maybe all castile soap is like this...I don't know.. This is the first time I've purchased it.

Stings eyes and tastes terrible so only so-so for kid friendliness, but no sodium laurel sulfate which seems to be the biggest culprit for destroying our beneficial bacterial colonies on skin.  So we use it on the kids mostly.  My microbiome is already shot and my skin likes dove better.

Perfect for making home made foaming hand soap.  Easy to mix with other ingredients.

It cleans very well, but it can leave you feeling really dry. If you use it on surfaces or fabric, make sure to thoroughly rinse it off, because it can leave some white residue behind.

I used this to start making my own eye makeup remover. Mixed with diluted water and olive oil it works great! Also leaves my eyes feeling great and not excessively greasy. Since you don't need much when mixing it will a long time making it economical. Makes a nice body wash too.

I like using this soap because it does not leave my hands terribly dry. It lightly smells like Olive oil. There are so weird ramblings on the bottle to read for entertainment. I would definitely purchase this again.

It would be nice if there was literature printed in this and sent with the product.The writing in the product container is too small to read

This is great soap but the entire label is political messages. I thought this was very bizarrre. Is there no escaping the debate and rhetoric that is dividing our nation?!?!

Dr. Bronners is amazing stuff. One bottle of this will last you months. (Maybe weeks if you have an exceptionally large family of cleaning freaks).When I started down this path, I only used it for refilling my hand soap containers. I dilute it at about 10 parts water 1 part soap - it makes for a very liquidy soap, perfect for the foaming containers which I have since confiscated from friends who still *gasp* buy new things of soap when one goes empty. Before I had the fancy shmancy foaming pumps, I just used the normal soap pumps. It worked fine, but it was runny which took a bit of time to get used to.But because it is so diluted and still cleans very well, I had a crazy amount of soap on my hands. So I started using it to clean other stuff. Dish detergent was the next thing on the list - I dilute it maybe a touch less than the hand soap (maybe 8 parts water to 1 part soap) and it works equally as well as the name brand dish soap that I used to buy. Only a few times have I felt the need to let things soak a bit longer than I would have otherwise, but even then I tended to soak overnight, so no real change. If you're as crazy as I am, you can add some citrus essential oil to it to help with the degreasing aspects. Just 20 drops or so. It's not necessary though - just gives it a nice scent and I like to think it helps things along a bit. I probably do this about half the time.Still so much soap left and, well, I ran out of some all purpose spray. Made my own with a bit of Dr. Bronners to a 50/50 mix of water & vinegar. Works AMAZING. I now use Dr. Bronners for just about any cleaning that requires soap. If it's a tough job, I don't dilute it as much. If it's a light job, I dilute it a bit more. If it's something that won't be rinsed (all purpose spray), I dilute it significantly. (Tip on stuff that isn't going to be rinsed, use distilled water if you have really hard water. Otherwise you might feel a bit of film. I just boil some in my electric kettle and let it cool. Works fine.)Infinitely cheaper, over all, than the stuff you buy in the store. And, bonus: not as many chemicals. I'm not anti chemicals or store bought cleaners, but I've come to the conclusion that they don't work significantly better (if at all), they're more expensive, and they're not any more convenient. It takes all of a minute to fill an old spray/pump/squirt bottle with water, add some Bronners, maybe add some fragrance, and move on. One bottle to do almost all. Never going back.If you've never used Bronner's in this way, you can easily find loads of tips & suggestions on the Google. Lisa Bronner even has a blog and has posted a chart with dilution rates. And dilution isn't an exact science. You don't have to measure it all out. I just eyeball it.

I use this to make my own foaming soap for SimpleHuman Touch free rechargeable soap dispenser. The replacement soap cartridges for this dispenser are expensive (proprietary design) but there are a few YouTube Videos showing how to open these cartridges (running cover under very hot water and prying off with flat blade "butter type" knife) or you can refill using large basting syringe with brass tip fits into top of cartridge, just hold open silicon air release valve with toothpick careful not to pop into jar (if u do then u need to remove top with heat to retrieve and insert back into top otherwise will not function properly in dispenser) - anyway back to soap - I fill 10 oz jar w/ 1/3 Castile soap, 6 drops of vitamin "E" oil, 1 tablespoon of Almond oil, then use high quality essence scents - mix as u like (Lavender, Seet Orange, Rosemary, Tea Tree, etc.. some have natural germ killing properties) depending on essence I add 3 to 10 drops of each (2 to 3 scents mixed) - then fill the rest of the jar using DISTILLED water - approx. remaining 2/3 of the 10 oz capacity jar - then turn upside down, right-side up, several times until mixture is blended - you don't want to shake vigorously because you'll get too much foam inside jar, mix gently. I write down my "formula" on the jar with a sharpie because it is hidden under the Superhuman dispenser anyway and it reminds me what's inside the jar so if everyone likes it, I can repeat formula without having to memorize or look for a piece of paper somewhere. The sharpie washes off with some elbow grease and chemical cleaner if you want to change it later on.  This blend with the Almond and Vit "E" oils keeps skin smooth and soft especially for hands in harsh chemicals/detergents or greasy/dirty from yard work etc.. It cleans well, is gentle, and smells unbelievably good - you can alter scent essences for male or female preferred scents. Rosemary, Tea tree, and Orange or Lemongrass work well in "Boys" bathroom, while Lavender, Rosemary, is a good start for "Girls" - let the wife and kids pick their favorite scents - My Blend FOAMS Great with this Superhuman dispenser, some dispensers like less soap / more water, mine likes this 1/3 soap to 2/3 water ratio, I tried different ratios that didn't seem to foam properly (too loose or too firm) - Amazon sells everything needed- although local stores like "Whole Foods" have some all natural scents and oils for soap making as well. - I like the unscented Castile Soap because I like a blank slate - but you can get the pre-scented Castile and save $$$ and hassle of creating/blending  your own scents. - EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE.To fill cartridge using the syringe type baster (or if you pop top off instead) - the baster can also be used to clean the Simplehuman Dispenser using the included vinyl hose to connect to nipple inside the bottom of the dispenser, fill syringe with very hot tap water, turn dispense on and squeeze syringe to feed and flush out the dispenser as the internal plumbing does eventually get clogged and unit will not work correctly, and may not dispense foam (air venture gets clogged with soap) - just liquid soap - so this syringe has a dual purpose - it can be used to fill empty cartridges if u don't want to pop top off with very hot water to soften top - and it is perfect and fast to clean out internal plumbing, valves, venture etc.. - Operates like new after cleaning - about every 3rd refill - cleaning necessary. Here is link to syringe baster I use - from Amazon its only $8.89 (at present)-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFTYIMO/ref=sspa_dk_detail_5?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01HFTYIMO&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a54d13fc-b8a1-4ce8-b285-d77489a09cf6&pf_rd_r=NQ7837VHW3GX4J5TMAZY&pd_rd_wg=pQmPM&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&pd_rd_w=mhgJ0&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pd_rd_r=86e369e4-ab64-11e8-ab28-01ad97aa66bb

I have purchased this soap for my daughter ever since she was born. I don't have to worry about scary chemicals or bad reactions on her sensitive skin. She is three-years-old now and she still uses this soap. I use it as a body wash for her skin and a shampoo for her hair. A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last you a long time. It's baby mild, which is why I have purchased this particular kind ever since she was a newborn. She doesn't cry when this gets in her eyes, but it still hurts; then again, water hurts her eyes, so I can't say if this hurts more than water. It has a faint smell, but nothing fancy or putrid. It just smells clean. When she was a baby, this soap allowed her yummy baby head-smell to shine through rather than masking it with that baby shampoo smell (which is a nice smell but not as nice as natural baby head smell). My daughter's hair still looks as healthy as baby hair and I always feel as if it's because of using this soap her entire life instead of damaging it with chemical shampoo. I have noticed how different her hair shine and texture looks compared to the other little girls in her church class. She also gets lots of compliments on how beautiful and healthy her hair is. Her hair is also silky soft.  I buy castile soap in place of my own body wash and shampoo, but I choose the black soap variety for me. This one is perfect for children and babies. This soap works up a decent lather but it's not like regular shampoo that lathers well because of chemicals. This is a large 32 oz bottle and that size will last for quite a while and can be distributed in smaller bottles if you prefer. I distribute this into a small squirt bottle that I keep in the shower so my shower rack isn't stuffed full. I use this big bottle as a refill.This soap can be used for more than body wash or shampoo. You can use it to clean your house, do dishes, laundry, and all sorts of things. If you look up the uses for castile soap, you'll be surprised. I have also used this soap to fill up the soap dispenser in my bathroom for hand-washing. This soap is runnier than regular hand soap, but it dispenses perfectly and is better for your hands than hand soap. Also, it's not as drying to your skin. It's totally worth the price.

I bought this because it was unscented, and I am gradually becoming allergic to every scent in existence. Luckily I probably croak before I run out of stuff to use. I bought this for an unconventional reason. I take iron supplements, and it turns my feces into iron. Not really, but hard as rocks. So I need to use an enema, they come out as little round rocks, instead of potato or small cucumber sized ones. Everyone online line said "Castile Soap, use Castile Soap!" in the enema. I bought this, and tried the "Sudsy soap on the finger test" inside me. No burning or irritation. So I added 5 drops to a gallon bag. No special effect, but not burning or anything.  I often get what i call "tea" out. It's brown, might have like tea grounds (Small chunks, goopy a little bit.), but doesn't move much. I upped it to 10 or 12 drops in a gallon. and it was dramatic. I got what I call "chili". Heavy, solid liquid that covers the entire bowl top. It dissolved everything. Which no other salt or chemical or enema solution did a damn thing. In fact multiple bowls. It does what people said it does. I tried it on my skin, it's supposed to be good on eczema, etc. It got the thick callous like spot near my elbows and knees off. All the excess skin. It's not as red, but the skin peels off in the shower with no scrubbing. I just rub it with my hands (Instead of scrubbing with a wet wash rag that reddens/irritates it.) and the excess skin peels away. Easy. I have blonde hair (Yes, from my mother, not a bottle!) and it gets frizzy and fly away constantly, and this works okay as a shampoo too for a couple of uses a week. The only thing I dislike is trying to get it out of that huge 32 oz bottle and it's cap. I bought a 8 ounce (300 Ml) oil and soap dispenser bottle here, I'll just pour it in, it has a flip top cap. i am not a big "All Natural Ingredients" person, but this seems to work as advertised. Just the enema use it is worth it too me. The eczema spots are a great bonus, we'll see how it's use as shampoo works out. I usually get two results. Oily and stringy, laid down flat, or stat-icky, fly away like "Doc" from the "Back to the Future" movies. My face tends towards oily, and it seems to remove and dry that up. If you have dry flaky skin, it might be too drying for you.

So much you can do with this soap.  It has clean ingredients!

This works great for making your own DIY hand and body wash. Costs only pennies compared to the $3-$4 products they sell in the store. I reuse the bottles the foaming soap comes in after they are empty and just make my own. Since this is fragrance free you can leave it as it is or add your own fragrance.This soap is gentle on your skin and lathers up great! I add distilled or boiled water leaving enough room inside for the bulky dispenser top. I then add 2 tablespoons of Dr. Bronner's  liquid soap. 1/2 tsp. of almond, jojoba, olive, or argan oil (use your favorite). I also open a vitamin E oil capsule, then add a few drops of my favorite essential oils. During cold and flu season I will use thieves oils or lemon oil for their germ fighting properties. Then add the top, and gently shake to mix. Just make sure you add the water first or you will have a foamy mess! :)This soap is very nice and feels great on your skin. It even cleans my husbands hands after he's been out in the garage. Very economical when you dilute it into your own recipes!

It’s very good for my body

Love Dr Bronner’s products

Works Great / Thank you!

We will always support and purchase Dr. Bronners products. They are a company, brand, and family that truly cares about their products and customers. They volunteer thousands of dollars to organozations that I deeply care about, and they represent at Burning Man too! Their soaps are clean and has so many uses! And the different scents are great, my favorate are almond and lavender.

Good price

Always ago to for me

I recently tried Dr. Bronner's soap as a body wash, and I must say, the scent is absolutely delightful. Smells wonderful and really refreshing-clean. Once use this soap, you never go back to other body shampoos because none of them quite match up. Highly recommend!

Used for houseplants to wash and remove bugs worked awesome

I love this product and would 10 out of 10 recommend it to anyone and everyone and I’ve been using it as a body was for almost 11 years now and it’s the only thing that works for my sensitive skin on my body and face

This is a great product for tattoo and piercings after care I recommend it to all my clients

Do not listen to people saying it's too harsh on the skin or hair when THEY ADMIT THEY DON'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS OF DILUTING.Natural,  organic oils are THE BEST things you can do to your hair,  face, body and home!! It's the toxic chemicals (bleach, borax, parabens, sulfates) that are poisoning us.Everyone has different skin therefore some people may need to dilute this a lot or just a little,  find what works for you. Bit I assure you there is a combination that will work for you.Do not listen to these licensed estheticians and hair stylists feeding you crap about only buying their high end products. That's why they LIE about these natural products because they can't sell them in their salon.I use this for everything!! Laundry soap, all purpose cleaner, floor cleaner,  hand soap, dish soap, body wash, shave lotion, shampoo and dog shampoo!! I like getting the unscented that way I can add my essential oils to it but all of them smell amazing!!Dr Bronner also sells hang sanitizer, hair rinse, hair creme, different body washes/ shave lotion and many other items on their website.

After decades of suffering and trying every product out there, I might have finally found something I'm not (and hopefully won't become) allergic to. Since getting this, I've used it for everything (body, hair, dish washing and laundry) and, so far so good, I'm loving it. For body, hair, and dish washing, I dilute it to a 1 to 5 ratio. In a 12oz foaming soap dispenser, I fill it to the 2oz line with Dr. Bronner's, and then the rest of the way with distilled water. For laundry, it depends on your machine, but for mine I put 2oz of Dr. Bronner's in the detergent dispenser, and 2oz of distilled white vinegar in the fabric softener dispenser. The distilled white vinegar is optional, but it helps the soap rinse out completely, is a natural fabric softener, and no, your clothes don't come out smelling like vinegar, in fact, they don't come out smelling like anything at all, which is more "unscented" than any unscented (free of dyes and perfumes) product I ever used or tried.

I used it to spray down my plans to get rid of any mites! Fantastic highly recommended

It leaves my hands nice and moisturized without feeling greasy.

I love this stuff. I have been using it faithfully for the past 3 years or so. You can, literally, use it for anything. I use it as a body wash, an all--purpose cleaner, a floor cleaner, a dish soap, a laundry detergent, and a hand soap. For the laundry detergent I do mix it with washing soda, so I can't attest to how it does by itself. I do use it, however, for treating stains on my laundry, and I am always very impressed with it; I just have to make sure that I soak the stain as soon as possible. I did try out Branch Basics to evaluate the difference between it and Dr. Bronner's, and I just feel like Dr. Bronner's is such a better deal. To me, it seems far more concentrated, and it is sold at a much lower price. If you want to cut down on the amount of household cleaning products (especially those that are harmful) you are buying, then this is definitely your best bet. Look nowhere else. I usually buy mine from Vitacost if I am looking to get the gallon. It is usually a better deal.

I bought this for my menstrual cup which is recommended to be cleaned with a mild unscented soap. Finding any soap that has no fragrance or that is unscented(yes those are 2 completly different terms) and natural was a crazy hard challenge. Everything was either a tiny bottle for a ridiculous price or if it said "natural" there was some crazy ingredient that I didnt want near my lady goods. You can read And understand every ingredient. They are natural and the soap is great. It is very runny so I just got an old pump had from a previous body wash and swapped caps. It seems like a steep price but you get a whole lot of product.Very mild,COMPLETELY unscented and it cleans very well. I would recommend to anyone with a baby, allergies,sensitive skin or looking for a way to clean her menstrual cup.Oh and even though it's runny(if you try to flip it over to pour some or push the pump down to hard you are going spill a lot of product. Happened to me lol) dont think I mean it's not going to get the job done. Just a tiny bit really is all you need. I guess it's just not a thick product.

The only soap I use it is all natural and not harsh on the skin

As most people do, when you think of liquid, castile soap, I think of Dr. Bronner's. It's the brand I always buy and have around. A little over two years ago, I had some health issues that required two major abdominal surgeries. I needed something gentle to clean the medical apparatus I was required to use at the time, so I bought the Dr. Bronner's Unscented Baby Castile Soap, instead of one of the presented varieties. It's what I continue to use.Started doing aromatherapy a little over a year ago. Took two online courses from a reputable aromatherapy institute--Natural Living and Butters & Balms. Make a lot of my own skincare products, including foaming hand soap. You fill an 8oz foaming soap bottle 2/3 full of distilled water and add: 2T of the Dr. Bronner's unscented Baby Castile soap, 1t fractionated coconut oil and 20 drops of essential oil. If you use it quickly, it doesn't require a preservative.This was a personal purchase. I paid full price.

This is AMAZING for washing your dog! You only need a tiny bit to suds up your pup. I have an Akita and a Jack Russell terrier. This is especially great for the Akita, he has a crazy thick coat. Usually I have to use almost a half bottle of dog shampoo on him to fully penetrate and suds up his coat.... but this stuff is like super-soap! Like I said, it suds up really well and removes all the oil, dirt, etc from your pup's coat. However, like any really strong soap, you gotta use a conditioner for your pet after you use this on their coat. I used apple cider vinegar and it complemented the soap nicely (the vinegar smell doesn't stay). Also, this soap doesn't have any strong smell so it's great if you live with someone who has fragrance sensitivities. This soap might seem expensive (I was reluctant at first) but it's lasted me a long time so far. I will definitely be buying this again.

I ordered a bunch of these from a local store, peppermint and almond, but found the scents to just be too much for me, so I came here to get the unscented and I absolutely love it!I make my own face wash, body wash, handsoap, feminine wash.. I use it on dishes and cleaning the floor, I love this stuff! I have hidredentitis supporativa and have some really annoying skin issues, but Dr. bronners cleans me up without leaving me dried out.Just... Don't use this stuff as shampoo, please. My only complaint, I used it once for shampoo and it took me washing my hair everyday and rinsing with vinegar for over a week to get it out. Not worth it.

I've used Dr. Bronner's since I was a kid, and in my opinion, the Baby Shampoo definitely lathers up the best.I also love that it's unscented; fragrances frequently overload me. I have a 4-oz bottle that I pour the big one into for ease of use; I have put a few drops of essential oils into the 4-oz which doesn't seem to affect the soaping action and allows me to titrate the scent. So far I've tried sandalwood and also jasmine; each worked fine, and I'm looking forward to trying others.It's very concentrated; a 32-oz bottle lasts me for 2+ years, so a great value, too. I also fill a 2-oz bottle for travel; on a 2 week trip I didn't even use half of it. (Note, I don't shampoo my hair often, so my usage is just body wash plus shampoo ~2/month.)

Dr. Bronner's is a miracle soap! I started incorporating natural productsinto my beauty routine, starting with Dr. Bronner's, and am already seeinga tremendous difference in my skin and hair. I use the baby soap as a basefor my essential oil blends for my facial cleanser, serum, and shampoo, andI love it!I also use it to make a shampoo for my dog who suffers from skin allergies; after one bath, her hair was noticeably softer with less tangles and she is significantly less itchy.An added bonus was the kind email I received from Dr. Bronner's HR department thanking me for my purchase and ensuring that the product was up to par.Between the cost, natural ingredients, numerous uses, and results, I fully endorse this product. I have recommended Dr. Bronner's to all of my family friends.

Love this stuff. We put a few drops in an empty 32 oz Dr. Bronner’s bottle with a pump re-used from a shampoo bottle, then fill the rest of the way up with water to make cloth baby wipes solution. (A couple pumps on a Cloth-Eez double-sided terry+flannel wipe handles even the scariest of diaper changes with one wipe and no smearing.) One 32 oz bottle lasts us a little over a year! The baby one isn’t as drying as the other varieties of Dr. Bronners, and it can still be used to wash dishes, dogs, or laundry in a pinch. (Doesn’t get clothes as clean as detergent, but it’s fine for one load on vacation or something.) Also great diluted with water in a foaming hand soap dispenser for hand washing.

Leaves you feeling really clean

I was looking for a gentle face wash that wasn’t loaded with chemicals and one that I could add YL essential oils to with ease.  The reviews of this product were outstanding.  Now I know why!  This stuff is amazing!!  I’ve been using it as a face wash and hand soap for several months, and it’s going to be a staple in our house.  As a matter of fact, I’m phasing out my old body wash and switching to this stuff!!  I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it in our house for the long-term.  (I purchased the lavender scented version.  If you don’t like the smell of lavender, you might want to opt for another scent.  The lavender scent is prominent, but certainly not cloying.)

I use this as my hand soap as I had a skin condition a few months ago and my hands were cracked and extremely painful. I love that it is unscented as I don't like scents on my hands at all. This is super gentle and combined with an excellent hand cream, my hands are healed. Unfortunately, they are discolored and scarred, but no more cracking or bleeding. I use less hand lotion or cream as well because of the moisturizing properties. My only complaint is that it gunks up the lid or dispenser if you put it in one. I can live with that. I'll be using this forever.

It's a good soap, I don't have much to say about it. I used it as an all purpose soap when I travel or go out camping. I use it as hand soap at home. I tried using it as toothpaste once (it tasted horrible and I don't recommend it). I like that it's scent free, it feels a little on the expensive side, especially since you go through it pretty quickly when you're using it as normal hand soap but I like having a bottle on hand and will likely repurchase. I used to use the peppermint kind as a bubble bath and I also liked that, but I like how versatile the unscented version is and will likely come back to that in the future.

I have super sensitive skin and was tired of using bar soaps all the time. I would get rashes or blister like areas and no other liquid soaps would do the trick. However, I’ve been using the unscented for two years ( 2 TBS per 10 oz) and have been fine! If I put too much in my dispenser my hands dry Out. I do recommend using a foam pump with this, and to make sure you dilute the soap depending on the size of your dispenser. Otherwise the soap is really concentrated and can be harsh on skin if not properly diluted. I have about 4 bottles in my house with three people and I’ve only had to buy more soap about once a year! Definitely would recommend for people who have sensitive skin!

I love Dr. Bronners! I am so glad i listened to so many other people telling me about all the homemade products they're making. When i would see a recipe for hand soap, bronners in it, i see a recipe for shampoo, bronners in it, i see a recipe for laundry soap, bronners is in it.  So finally i realized i had to have this in order to start converting over to making my own natural products. I will never regret it. The bottle is carefully sealed. it smells delightful, it has a great consistency. it is very concentrated, so a little goes a long way. And then i got to reading the bottle, that was very entertaining! a lot of facts and lots suggestions of suggestions. if you try this you will never try any other alternative. the possibilities are endless!

This is the best soap if you have sensitive or dry skin.  I was itching for two years until I started using this exact brand of Dr. Bronner's (for babies). Now I make sure to always have a back-up and a travel size on hand.  I don't know what I would do if they ever stopped selling it!

I really enjoy how gentle this soap is. I also like that it isn’t thick like normal body wash. The soap of course doesn’t have much of a smell which is a plus. I know some people use this as shampoo but I wouldn’t recommend that if you have textured hair. It just will make it kinda tangly and remove some of the necessary moisture of your hair. I still rate this 5 stars though because this is a soap and it does great as a soap!  I trust it on even dry skin areas which I try not to wash as much since they’re quite small and dry out quickly obviously. All in all, definitely will purchase again!

It dries your skin out if you use it too much so you have to moisturize after work but it cleans very well. You can see the dirt fallen off your skin.

Product works well. We have used on my infant grandson with no problems. I've also used it to wash dishes and it cleaned well with no oily residue like some I've used in the past. (Note there will not be any lasting suds as this does not contain sulfates like commercial liquid dish soap. Sulfates do not get the dishes any cleaner, it is just what consumers have come to expect and is bad for the environment). My primary use is making my own foaming hand soap using special pumps to create the foam and essential oils to kill germs as opposed to hormone altering commercial antimicrobial/antibacterial soaps. As to all the writing on the bottle I've read reviewers complain about, I truly do not have time to sit around reading labels so I could care less. And besides, to each their own.

I was recommended this product to clean my new tattoos about 2 years ago. They only had a small bottle of soap at the tattoo shop. Once that ran out, I've ordered soap bars and bottled ever since. I absolutely love it. This is the only soap I've found that doesn't leave my skin dry once I'm out of the shower. It's absolutey fantastic. I've kept using it to clean my new tattoos over time and as daily use. It is really soapy as well, which I love because a small drip over my body sponge and it's enough to clean my whole entire body, and then some. It really is super soapy. I love it. You can always dilute it in some water if you want something less soapy for your children.

I use the soap mainly to make body products with.  I have sensitive skin and it is hard to find the right product to use.  I have use the soap with the foaming pump bottle and if works great in it. (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BTXECTG/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)The soap is very gentle on the skin. It does not make me break out and is not irritating.  There is no strong odor to it and is light weight. I have also washed some clothes with it and they come out very clean. The soap last a long time and is worth the money to buy it.

I bought this to use in a facial cleanser recipe. My skin is older and I needed something that would lift surface impurities without drying out the skin itself like harsher products do. This is now my 100% go to soap product. My skin loves it. Next I'll try it on my hair.

I love Dr. Bronner's soap.  I use this to bathe, wash hair, wash pets, wash dishes, make into foaming hand soap, do laundry, have washed my car with it. and anything else I need soap for.  I have lots of allergies to chemicals used in many detergents and soaps, but this stuff is like liquid gold.  It works well and I never react to it.  I am a user for life!!

Truly amazing soap which can replace multiple other products: hand soap, face soap, feminine wash, glasses cleaner, hand wash laundry, fruit & vege wash, perfect travel soap. I even carry a one ounce refillable bottle of it on our long distance bike rides as many public bathrooms are always out of soap & it's great for washing off scrapes as part of first aid. Then there's the grease & grime from changing a bike flat.It is major concentrated so the price is really not bad.On a bicycle, I carry it full strength in a one ounce spill proof dropper bottle (sold by REI).For travel or home use, I bought refillable foamer bottles in two sizes from Amazon & use a 1 to 5 dilution.

Cleans the little one better than any other product we’ve used!  I originally used Dr. B’s peppermint soap to cut old motor oil that other soaps couldn’t get to and have since expanded to every scent available.  You can’t go wrong with any of the castile soaps and you only need a tiny amount so you’re saving money in the long run!  The versatility to have one soap gentle enough to thoroughly clean a babe with no irritation to being able to cut ground in oils with just a few drops is insane!

Your superb product is being enjoyed and well used.From killing mealy bugs to a gentle facial cleanser one of the few my skin will tolerate and much in-between.One of the simple pleasures of life always look forward to using.Use several varieties of Dr. B all are a wonder and work so perfectly.Know all is safe with Dr. B and the jobs will be done perfectly. Very quick delivery appreciated also.Always reach for Dr. B this is my first time with the “baby” version think may turn out to be the favorite of all.Thank you kindly

Love it. After having used this for more than 12 weeks now, I must say, I love the product. Unlike a number of products that brand themselves as organic, this one is true to it's label. Tell tale signs of a soap being organic are the following.No left overs. Highly water solvable and hence doesn't leave anything behind.Doesn't froth much. Just enough to wash the dirt out of your skin.No added fragrance.This ultra high concentrate is quite economical. I use hardly 8 drops (yeah drops) for my son who is 5 years old. This one is going to last quite a while. While this product can be used as a hair care product as well, some of us may not like it's hair cleansing powers or the lack of it. It doesn't alter anything and so may not give a shampoo wash after effect.

I used this product for laundry alone. My fiancé works outdoors and always comes home with stains, grease, oil, etc all on his work clothes. This soap helped with removing tough stains. Will be purchasing again.

Great shampoo. I purchased this because I just got starter Locs. I want to keep chemicals out of my hair. It works well and was recommended by a relative. I have the most sensitive skin ever. I know this will work well. I made a mistake while ordering, I wanted the baby powder scent. I ended up getting UNSCENTED. 😔Definitely not the seller’s fault. That was all me.

The new carton no longer has the safety-minded ""punch outs"" in the carton which allowed you to easily feed the wax paper without fear of the knife edge cutter. These ""punch outs"" are gone on the new carton. My wife has already cut her finger with the new carton while trying to feed out the wax paper roll.Further, the cardboard-tube core is now gone.

The box, however looks like it’s been through hell, I’m not gonna bother with sending it back to Amazon because quite frankly it’s annoying to return things and I keep my wax paper hidden in the cupboard anyway so no one else is going to see it and by the time I get a sheet ripped off and put the damn thing back in the cupboard. I would’ve forgotten how crappy the other packaging is , it’ll just irritate me every time I pull it out and make me happy when I put it back that would be an incentive for me to keep it off my counter and underfoot yours probably will arrive just fine so go ahead and buy it like I said, multitudes of uses for wax paper  And just like buying a bag to hold down my bags I am not gonna buy a box to hold on my rolls of wax paper, tinfoil, etc. those are more of a pain in the behind the net worth anyhow, happy wax paper in if you’re old-school like me, you can tolerate quite a lot and Reynolds wrap happens to be a good company  Well at least they were back in the day",-1,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I ordered two rolls, since I use it for a variety of different things. One roll stays in the kitchen for all the kitchen and food type stuff. The other roll goes in the shop to protect surfaces for things like gluing, painting, applying polyurethane, epoxy, and so forth. This paper is fairly thin and moisture gets through with some paints and glues, but that’s a simple fix. I just put a paper towel or napkin on the outer side to absorb any moisture while the product dries.The one star deduction is because both rolls came squished and distorted. You couldn’t tell by the outside of the box, but somehow the cylindrical tubes holding the wax paper inside the box were a mess. I tried to reform the tubes without much luck. This makes it a challenge to tear off even pieces of waxed paper. The paper itself however, is great!",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Actually I'm using more towels to compensate.Not buying Scott anymore and  I'm returning mine + the price went up.  Makes no sense and no explanation.

What happened to this product? I buy this all the time and this is such a drastic change in your product! I own a daycare and been using this paper towel for many many years.

Instead of raising the price, they just give you less quantity. Each sheet is now so thin that each packaged stack, is only 2/3 as tall as it used to be.

Just saw they updated their photos on this product claiming they are the same amount. I just counted another one and it is 25 short per package. So they are lying. Attorney Generals office will be notified.I have been buying these for 10 yrs. They used to be thicker and more absorbing and easy to pull just one out. Now you pull them and they are all stuck together. It’s like every 3rd one that comes out has another 3 stuck to it. So you pull out so many when you only want one. And the packing around them (brown paper) used to be so tight it was almost spring loaded when you opened it. Now they are all mushy and falling out without even opening it. They feel more like Kleenex and fall apart when wet. They are awful. And I purchase the same ones. I just reorder the same thing every month. So they changed and made them cheap and worthless.

They seem pretty similar to ones I’ve used in a commercial restroom. But if for home use, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. I bought these because the price for the Tork brand I love for our kitchen dispenser (Tork MB 578) and bathroom had been discontinued and the price skyrocketed. But after a few months, I’m ready to pay up for something better and put these in the garage! They’re so rough and spew so much paper dust that I dread pulling one from the dispenser, and they’re not a good alternative to regular paper towel given their stiffness and lower absorbency. So far two packs also had poor cuts on one end of the stack, adding a messy confetti experience to each pull from the dispenser. The bits were still too attached to pull off before placing in the dispenser but not attached enough to stay put when pulling out a sheet. Definitely not the quality I want folks to use after hand washing in the bathroom either, especially someday when we have actually have guests inside the house again …",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I’m a foster mom and I like that they’re easier for the kids and me to grab if they just need one, and they’re more hygienic than a cloth bathroom hand towel.  I was disappointed that they’re not softer and absorbent than your average paper towel, and actually a little rough.  They remind me of those brown colored paper towels that you find in a roll dispenser at public bathrooms (other than the color).  I went around and compared them to roll paper towels of other brands in my house (touching and testing each one for absorbance and softness) and even the cheapest rolls of paper I have are softer and more absorbent.  I’m still glad I tried the trifold towels and bought the dispensers, because they help the kids and me just grab one, and they are more hygienic and convenient, but after I work my way through the gigantic box of these, I’ll be looking for a different type/brand.  I wish they came in smaller amounts so that I wouldn’t have to store so many and use the entire case before I buy a different brand.

This matters to me because I have found numerous studies that show that post con rec fiber products, including towels, have a high level of bacteria. The frustration stems from the obscurity of the answer to that question.  I finally found one commercial product site that says that this contains 10% pre consumer and 40% post consumer recycled fiber. So then I called Kimberly Clark and asked the customer service rep the same question. She said that her information shows no recycled fiber content.So: caveat emptor. Great product.

I was surprised at the quality.  I was expecting the towels to be pretty rough and well... cheap feeling.  I was definitely wrong.  Surprisingly much softer than the typical paper towels that come from dispensers. They are kinda mighty too,  don't tear easily when you don't want them too.  They dispense one at a time with ease.  I didn't realize how long they would last.  There is alllloooooot of paper towels.  Seems nothing is cheap these days with rising prices,  but I feel for the quality and quantity, the cost was worth it. I've now started friends and family buying the same.  Food for thought,  don't go real cheap on the dispenser.  Get something nice and sturdy.  I like the ones that have a lock with a key.  Keeps them clean and not exposed to things.  I think they look nice too with so many styles and cookies colors available. I've got one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  Guests love them.  Most people don't want to dry their hands on someone else's cloth towels.  They are great for clean ups and I use them did cleaning windows and mirrors because they don't leave the dust like regular paper towels can. The paper that holds the individual packs together is strong.  My first case of 16 packs lasted about a year and not one of the bundles broke open.  Just a nice little thanks that they didn't go cheap.  Nothing worse than a pile of multifold paper towels now a pile of multi mess! Little helper note: when you open a new bundle,  hold one end of the stack with 2 hands and shake it, fanning them,  and then hold the other end and do the same.  By loosening them a bit they dispense perfectly.",0,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I searched for an alternative product & ended up purchasing another brand trifold paper towels from another retailer at first and a plastic dispenser for under $10 from Amazon. Much later, I switched to this brand of trifold paper towels which were a better grade product than what I originally bought. Ever since, I have kept these stocked in my home. They are so handy and we've saved a lot of money on our regular top dollar brand of roll paper towels by saving them for use when we need a heavy duty of that kind. These towels are sturdy & one is perfect for drying your hands and other day to day uses. I love that you can grab one with one hand and not have to touch anything else.

It was posted on January 15, 2014. I get annoyed when people have dirty hands and hold the roll to tear off the paper towels. Not to mention the ones that don't touch the roll but just jerk it and waste so many paper towels. This product solves the problem. Now I will talk about the ""Kleenex Multifold Paper Towels (01890)"" that I purchased. I read a lot of the reviews and here is my opinion.*First, I didn't buy these to wipe a baby's face (although they would be great when wet). I have been making my own baby wipes out of regular bounty and aldi paper towels for a long time when I found out about formaldehyde being in the big name brands.*Second, I was skeptical when I read some of the negative reviews, but I gave it a shot based on Bert's review. I knew we would used them somehow even if they weren't the quality I hoped for. Don't believe the naysayers. I am highly critical of cleaning products (being a germie-phobe).Conclusion: These paper towels are awesome! Imagine a medium starched cotton broadcloth with bumps. (I am posting pics of the paper towel dry and wet.) When they are damp or wet they become very smooth and soft. They are VERY strong and absorbent. My kitchen and bathroom are SO clean now (as if they weren't already) but it is so easy to grab one, pump a dab of cleaning liquid on it and wipe away. I love looking at the dirt and grime it picked up when I thought it was already totally OR sanitized. (How is that even possible?) They don't tear or shred or bunch up when wiping surfaces like a regular bountie (intentional sp*). One towel is plenty to dry hands. I'm happy with not wasting so much paper and the price is great too. I plan to sign up on a delivery subscription with my next order.Also my indecision on the right dispenser...I chose this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040ZOE7Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is not exactly as shown on the page, but had ""Scott"" logo on the front. I plan to put a cute sticker over it for decoration. The towels fit perfectly and dispense great also. (Will be posting a review on it also.) It is heavy duty plastic and easy to load.So from me to you: HAPPY WIPING!!",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I recently purchased Kleenex® Multifold Paper Towels (01890) and I am very happy with my purchase.Strength and Absorbency:These paper towels are incredibly strong and absorbent. They are able to handle spills and messes without tearing or falling apart. I also appreciate how soft the towels are, which makes them gentle on my hands.Convenience:The multifold design of these paper towels is very convenient, as it makes it easy to dispense a single towel at a time. I also appreciate the fact that they come in a large quantity, which means I don't have to restock as frequently.Cost-Effective:These paper towels are cost-effective and provide good value for the price. They are affordable without sacrificing quality, which is important for my small business.Eco-Friendliness:While I appreciate the quality of these paper towels, I do wish they were more eco-friendly. The fact that they are not made from recycled materials is a downside, and I would prefer to see Kleenex offer a more environmentally friendly option.Conclusion:Overall, I would highly recommend Kleenex® Multifold Paper Towels (01890) to anyone looking for a strong, absorbent, and convenient paper towel option.

Love it? Heck no.. these are definately ""Gotta Have It!""..I purchased these after reading a plethora of reviews on the folding industrial paper towels. In my household we have always used bounty rolls and we just go through them way too fast. I needed a cost effective alternative, so after a bit of research this was it.  I paid $20 for a clear plastic dispenser that I stealthily mounted on a cabinet side a bit out of the way near the back door in kitchen. Then I filled it up when these arrived and started using them for just myself at first. I knew it wasnt going to be a happy transition in my house. Cost saving techniques rarely are.. So my wife wasnt happy about it at first once finding out and my daughter didnt know what to do with one since its not on a roll.. but after couple weeks everyone had a chance to try them and we ended up going thru 1 sleeve in the course of about a month. I love the absorbency of these. I always hated to waste towels when washing my hands not to mention grabbing a roll with wet hands means you end up with a wet roll and have to tear off even more sheets than needed bevasue they become unusable.. not with these bad guys.. grap the bottom and yank and 1 comes out..  I use 2 when i wash hands and its perfect. When we spill something, We grab a handful rather than half the roll..  They work awesome, everyone loves them now and the price is awesome.

The local Dollar Store has these for $16 but you must pay tax, physically go to the store, etc.This is not all. I sincerely wish I had some of the towels left from the May boxes because they are now shipping redesigned towels and boxes. Yes, if you still have a box from May, compare it to your June box.The June box is smaller, which is nice because it takes up slightly less space on the towel rod but I also noticed something else... This is where I cannot truly verify my own feelings. An anecdote, if you will... The towels from the new box feel ""lighter"" and a tad bit smaller. This falls to the chicken/egg idea... Folks, I noticed there was a difference in towel absorbency and ""feeling"" BEFORE I checked the boxes.While the boxes claim the same dimensions on the towels, there is nothing to denote a specific ""weight"" to the towels that would indicate strength or surface area to roughly equate to the ability to absorb moisture.I feel as if the trend with these Kleenex Hand Towels are going the way of many of the toliet papers that are being sold here on Amazon. The companies will build up very high regard, and this reviews, for a product and then make slight price increases and lessen the material [read smaller boxes=smaller towel density] and thus increase profit with virtually no one taking notice. I want to call this a halo product but it is more of a ""bait and switch"" and ""supply/demand/price increase"" thing.I loved the old towels, as of May 2013, but now I am considering a cancellation of my subscribe and save. Almost a 3 dollar price increase and I am getting less to dry my large American hands...

And the design isn't my taste either, so I emptied out an old box and filled it with the new towels and threw the bizarre box away.  And I cancelled the auto ordering for this product. Don't want to buy more until this lame design is phased out. So I want to Target to some, and guess what--a shelf full of the Betsi Johnson designed boxes on clearance and no normal boxes.

The customers who complained that the Kleenex hand towels delivered after May 2013  are smaller, softer/thinner than the ones delivered only a few months before (May 2013 or earlier) are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. These are smaller and disintegrate when wet. And what a shame that the manufacturer insists there is no change in either size of each towel or its strength. I have boxes of each... The dimensions given on both on the outside of the box clearly document the size change. The quality decrement is immediately noticeable.

I was waiting my turn at the sink when her daughter yelled, ""Mom, these towels stink!""My lady friend raised a couple of the towels to her nose and confirmed that they did, in fact, smell unpleasant. I pulled a few towels from the box and yikes, not a good smell at all. We opened two more boxes and they had the same odor. YUK!!What's possibly worse, is that the odor transfers to your hands. Not a stretch to say that the unpleasant odor would transfer from the towel to whatever body part it came into contact with.Maybe a production issue of some sort at the manufacturing facility is the culprit, I don't know. I doubt Amazon will care, but I wanted to let my fellow Amazon Primers know of my experience (and the two young ladies experience) with these rather stinky towels.I'm sending these towels back to Amazon and we'll go back to Brawny paper towels.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

I agree with others that the new gaudy boxes in the mix are a big L. On the other hand, paper companies have been foisting hideous Kleenex boxes on us for decades and we put up with that, so... meh. I can live with a box designed by--I'm guessing--some crazy scrapbook lady. I've seen worse. Those original embossed boxes were the classiest ever, though, man! Like a little minimalist sculpture on the countertop! Bring those back, K-C!*-*-*-*-There must be a bestselling business book in this mystery: why do so many companies, of all sizes, feel compelled to ""fix"" products that are perfect, wrecking them in the process? I find it hard to believe that I am the only consumer who would rather just pay more to get the same quality if there have been increases in material or other costs that affect the company's bottom line. Especially when we are talking about a product that is positioned as a superior, premium product in the first place.Kleenex Hand Towels are the latest victim. I've used them since they came on the market, I always paid a premium for them and I would pay a higher premium to keep the unique level of quality. No such luck.Some time earlier this year they redid the box. That was a bummer because those old embossed boxes were really swell, but that's a minor thing. The change to the towels (Generation 2) themselves at that point was pretty subtle. Not as sturdy and thick, not as much a quality feel. I didn't like it as much, but I could live with it.My most recent Subscribe and Save batch that I just cracked open is a big step down even from that first change. The towels (Generation 3) feel and look even thinner, grayer and rougher, but the big problem is the new chemical smell. Since I use these on my face, that is extremely noticeable. I have some left of the original type (Generation 1) and the type from earlier this year (Gen 2) and I compared them. I can pick out the brand new ones (Gen 3) with my eyes closed because of the strong smell. The box, SKU, etc are identical to Gen 2.I'm actually going to send these back to Amazon, although I feel bad because it's not their fault. Since Amazon is one of the few companies in America that seems to understand giving customers what they want, I am hoping that if they have to eat some returns,  they will in turn crack some skulls over at Kimberly-Clark. So I encourage those of you who agree with me to do returns as well. I am going to call the Kleenex customer service number, but we all know that won't do any good. (""In order to serve you better, we have reformulated our product. Our extensive market research shows that consumers love the new feel of Kleenex Hand Towels. Thank you for contacting us."")

However, the number of towels in a box and the length and width of the towels is the same as the old.  So how can they fit them in the smaller box?  I think they are packed a little tighter, but somehow they are not as thick as the old ones.  I say ""somehow"" because when I first pulled a new towel out it felt lighter, softer, and thinner than the old ones.  But when I compared them side by side, to my surprise the difference was much less...the older ones just seemed rougher to the touch but not necessarily heavier.I decided to do a strength test.  I grabbed an OLD towel in both hands in front of me (like grasping a steering wheel) and sharply and quickly stretched the towel. 3-4 times it was solid and didn't rip.  Then I tried the same test with the NEW towel.  On the second stretch both sides ripped!  I repeated the test with two more towels from the old and new, and the same result.So yes, somehow the new towels are softer and more importantly less durable.  However, I still find them acceptable for their purpose and have not had any problems with them ripping when trying to pull them from the box.  After all, it's a paper towel - don't treat it like a sheet of Kevlar.  All that being said, just like any paper towel you will still be using 2 in order to completely dry your hands.And note to Kleenex:  Yes, apparently we DID notice that tiny change you made to save a few pennies...Why do people insist on fixing things that aren't broken?",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Quality Control issues! The box containing the individual boxes is crushed in with a very particular pattern completely around the box. The Kleenex are still usable but it is sad that quality control is really suffering regarding the packaging and the individual boxes are not tearing at the perforations without ripping the plastic off with it. I can tell the package issue is NOT from Amazon transporting them. It's obvious by other observations that the boxes are taped AFTER being crushed in. The taping is not creased or shows no sign of having been distorted. Also Amazon obviously doesn't package the individual boxes within. I only noticed QC issues after about 2 months into the COVID lockdowns. So I firmly believe that Quality Control has become a low priority for Kleenex Corporation.

The boxes are not attractive and the little (emphasis on little) hand towels are okay but nothing spectacular.  Not that I expect spectacularity from a hand towel, but these things feel a bit skimpy to me.I looked around for a dispenser that I could perhaps put the towels into to improve their appearance ( I really dislike the odd shape of the box -- I thought I would like it but seeing it up close, I don't) but I couldn't find one.  I don't think these will fit in a normal tissue dispenser, will they?BOTTOM LINE: Look, they aren't terrible but I just expect more from the kleenex brand and these fall short in my opinion.

These hardly qualify as paper towels.  While you can use them to dry your hands, it just seems such a waste as they don't always do the job.  Then there's the matter of how much space they take up.  Just something else to take space from your counter.  If they were a bit more decorative, that might help somewhat.  I think the main sell is the unique slant on the top of the box.  I tried them in a  towel rack upside down...  That's not very handy either... as they seem to be behind the towel bar and kept getting stuck there.  These could be used in a vehicle on a road trip for clean up a vehicle as they sit fairly well between your seat and the console... push them in.  But they're expensive for what they are...or at least I think so.

They are soft but sturdy, easy to use, convenient, and most of all, SANITARY!! As the mother of 5 kids, I was always bothered by how dirty our hand towels were, those were dirt and germs being spread through my family, I was always washing hand towels(like daily), and I knew there had to be a better solution.I tried washcloths that would be used once then washed, however, you have NO IDEA how much laundry this makes in a 7person household, nor did even I have any idea how many washcloths needed to be purchased to make this a viable option. The 80 that I purchased just didnt cut it, I needed about 4-5 times that...this also requires keeping a ""nice set"" for company separate from the family use towels.I found a coupon for these hand towels on s&s and decided to give them a try, if I didnt like them as hand towels, I could use them for papertowels. They are perfect hand towels!! They keep everything sanitary, are soft enough to use on faces(even baby faces), and the dispenser is nice for setting on a towel rack(which is also my only complaint). I can fit 2 side by side on my bath towel rack(and have a decorative towel on my hand towel ring).These hold up well wet and dry, my 3yr old uses them to cover her eyes when washing her hair and then proceeds to use it as a washcloth, it does well. I have also grabbed them to clean bathroom messes, again, they hold up to multiple rinsings and ringings and scrubbings.I am removing a star for 2 reasons.1)the dispenser, while fitting on my towel rack, is a bit top heavy and has a tendency to topple down. I do have a narrow towel bar to wall opening, so maybe others wont have this issue.2)I wish they made a refillable dispenser, throwing away 6-8 boxes each month just seems like such a waste(yes, I know this is a small issue compared with all the towels being thrown away and yes it is all recyclable(towels and box), but still).The negatives are a fine trade off in comparison to the sanitation issues I was facing in a household of children(no matter how many times we do handwashing training, they just dont get it...but it does eventually sink in, my 14yr old is an expert hand washer now ;-))So, if you are looking for a great, recyclable, sanitary hand towel, look no further...but be aware that you will likely have the cleanest bathroom in the neighborhood as you wont be able to resist drying you hands and proceeding to wipe up the sink, mirror, door handle, etc :-)",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 1, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I loved the box design and it was a perfect fit for between the medicine cabinet and a shelf I have up in there and because I liked the way the white looked against the chocolate walls I removed the towels and stapled the box to the wall and replaced the towels (I tried heavy duty tape at first but it was always leaning off the wall) and I use light tape to keep the top closed. The great thing is when I want to change the box color it's easy to remove the box you just pull it from the wall and repeat the staple steps. I see a lot of people comment about the quality of the towels and while they were thicker and a little larger in the beginning you really get what you pay for and when you buy in bulk you can't really complain, when I use to get these in the supermarket they were $5.99 a box thus tax here in Manhattan and buying in bulk here on amazon they're a little under $3.00 a box so I'm not going to complain I have seen hand towels that are thicker and larger but they also cost more (45 in a pack for $5.99 and that's on Amazon, no dispenser box...you have to put them on a flat surface and for people with kids of messy other half's that could mean wet towels) Overall I enjoy the product and even use them myself from time to time I took away 1 star for changing the quality of the product  I didn't care so much about the size change.

Since my initial order of 6 boxes, I have ordered another case.Each hand towel is sufficient to dry a person's hands.  I like the ease of the dispensing one towel at a time when opening the box.  The problem comes when nearing the last 20 or so towels and they no longer 'pop up' which causes a person to dig in the box to retrieve a towel.  Despite this minor annoyance, I like the product and how it feels on my hands. It is soft and supple and has good absorption.  On occasion I have used them to take care of minor clean ups on the bathroom counter and they hold up as well as most paper towels.

No matter the packaging, the parchment paper is all good, reusable up to four times in the oven, and able to withstand temperatures to 425ºF. The paper is made in France from wood pulp fibers and packaged in the USA. Reynolds doesn't say what it's coated with. The selling point of this 12-inch roll of parchment is its width. If you have baking sheets that are a little wider than 12 inches, this will fit perfectly and may save you time and money, as you won't have to cut it.My baking pans are narrower, however, so the 15-inch-wide, 36-foot-long rolls work better for me, and a like the SmartGrid feature, not available on the 12-inch paper, which is a grid printed on the paper that helps me cut a straight line. I mostly use parchment for baking meringues and chips made from various greens, especially those that tend to flatten out when baked, like radish or beet greens. When I make meringues, I cut the parchment after baking to put between the layers of meringues in my storage container. Parchment can also be used to steam fish in the oven or to wrap hard cheeses for storage. It's non-stick and heat-resistant, so it has many uses.

The first notable difference in these two types of parchment papers is their color. As you'd expect from the name, bleached parchment is white, while unbleached parchment is brown. This is because unbleached parchment paper is untreated and fully chlorine-free, while its bleached counterpart is treated with chlorine which gives of the white color. The two most common parchment paper coatings are silicone and Quilon. Quilon is cheaper but can't be used multiple times and it has a much lower max bake temp (about 375). Silicone is more expensive and can be used multiple times up to the stated temperatures. Although the width is 12 inches you can find larger sizes to accommodate larger width cookie sheets.

When friends and all the neighbor kids constantly are running in and out of our house, I feel more confident in maintaining a clean environment.With the caveat of a higher price tag, the peace of mind and the reduced risk of illnesses circulating in the house is priceless.

I've been using them for years!  They are a good size and one is good enough to dry your hands.  They are soft and are absorbent.  I think they are a great way to stop germs from spreading.  I just don't like the concept of everyone using the same towel in the bathroom to dry their hands, and because it gets so much use it's always a little damp.

The unbleached paper is sturdy and non-stick, making it perfect for baking and cooking various dishes without worrying about them sticking to the pan.One of the standout features of this parchment paper is its eco-friendly aspect. Being unbleached, it's a more environmentally conscious option compared to traditional bleached parchment paper. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm making a more sustainable choice for my kitchen.However, there are a couple of drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a perfect rating. Firstly, the packaging could be improved. The box design makes it difficult to dispense the parchment paper smoothly, often resulting in tearing or uneven cuts. It would be great if Reynolds could redesign the packaging to ensure a more user-friendly experience.Additionally, the cutter built into the box doesn't work as effectively as I'd hoped. It tends to get stuck or jammed, making it frustrating to use. I often find myself resorting to scissors instead, which defeats the purpose of having a built-in cutter.Overall, Reynolds Kitchens Unbleached Parchment Paper is a high-quality product that performs well in the kitchen. However, I hope to see improvements in the packaging and cutter design in future iterations to enhance the user experience.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It was hard to capture in the video while ripping a piece but you can clearly see how much dust is generated from ripping one of these under the sunlight. It was an accidental but shocking discovery one sunny afternoon in my kitchen. There was a ton of dust coming from the end of the ripped paper towel from shaking the detached piece as well (couldn’t attach that video due to file size limitation) We switched to a better brand immediately, and I genuinely hope Amazon will consider reengineering these for the better. I do not recommend these paper towels for families with small children, elders, folks with allergies, anyone with compromised health or has health concerns.

I was hoping to not have to renew my Sam's Club membership by getting the items I normally buy in bulk from Amazon instead. All was okay at first. The first few sheets came off good and I thought I had made a great purchase. But after a few sheets in, the layers were not lined up. Any time I would try to tear a sheet off I would get 2 separate layers and fluff and powder from what was in between the layers would fly out and coat everything within a foot or so of the paper towels. Daily, I have to clean up the powder and fluff from my countertop, the top of my coffee maker and anything else that had the misfortune of sitting on my counter at the moment. I thought maybe it was just a bad roll but then I have had 4 more rolls, same thing.

To start off, I’ll say we love Scott Paper Towels! So this review isn’t about the paper towels themselves. I will NEVER order this, or anything remotely like it again. We felt the paper towel rolls were very small. They seem like single size rolls to be honest. That was $31 for 30 rolls that measure 4” across. What was more upsetting was all the packaging and boxing it took to get these to our house. Both of the packs of 15 rolls were individually wrapped in their own plastic. Those plastic packages were then placed in their own Scott Paper Towels box. Then that whole box was placed in another very oversized cardboard box. Practically embarrassed that we fell for that!

With 6 double rolls equating to 12 regular rolls (100 sheets per roll), these paper towels are designed for convenience and efficiency.**Versatile Sheet Sizes:** One of the standout features of the Scott Choose-A-Sheet towels is the ability to select the size of the sheet you need. Whether it’s for a quick spill or a larger task, the option to choose a smaller or full-size sheet helps reduce waste and ensures you’re only using what you need.**Highly Absorbent:** These paper towels are impressively absorbent, making clean-up a breeze. I’ve used them for everything from wiping up spills in the kitchen to drying hands and cleaning surfaces. They soak up liquids quickly without falling apart, which is a huge plus when you’re dealing with messes.**Durable Construction:** Scott prides itself on creating strong paper products, and these paper towels are no exception. They hold up well even when wet, allowing for effective scrubbing without tearing. This durability means I can tackle tougher cleaning jobs without fear of the towel disintegrating in my hands.**Value for Money:** With 6 double rolls providing the equivalent of 12 regular rolls, the Scott Choose-A-Sheet towels offer great value. I found that they last longer than many other brands, so it feels like a substantial investment for efficient cleaning without constantly restocking.**Convenient Packaging:** The packaging is straightforward and easy to open, and the rolls fit perfectly on standard paper towel holders. The compact size of each roll makes it simple to store in pantry shelves without taking up too much space.**Overall Impressions:** In conclusion, Scott Choose-A-Sheet Paper Towels are a reliable choice for anyone looking for versatile, durable, and efficient cleaning solutions. Their absorbency and customizable sheet sizes make them ideal for various tasks around the home. I highly recommend them to families, individuals, or anyone seeking a quality paper towel that meets everyday needs with ease! 🧼✨",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I don’t know what the Viva product was like before this but it seem as if this is their new and updated version of the “signature cloth” series. In this pack you get four packages of 6 rolls, so 24 rolls total. I do think the rolls seem to be smaller than my typical normal paper towels but that’s probably due to them being thinner and sturdier than Bounty or another brand. The material is hard to explain, it’s soft but rough at the same time. It’s squishy and padded but the texture of the whole paper towel is kind of rough. I personally think these cloth paper towels are a lot more sturdy in the way that they don’t rip when they get wet. You can use them for longer because the towels don’t disintegrate. They are also surprisingly absorbent for being so thin but I’m not sure if they’re as absorbent as a normal paper towel.These definitely have pros and cons. They’re more sturdy but maybe less absorbent. The roll is smaller because the paper towels are thinner but the paper towels are tougher. These are definitely on the more expensive side at around $1.38 per roll in this case but you’re also paying for the convenience of having them shipped to your house.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Here’s why these paper towels stand out:Strong and Durable:These paper towels are incredibly strong and durable, mimicking the feel and performance of a cloth. They hold up well when scrubbing tough messes and don’t tear easily, even when wet. This makes them perfect for heavy-duty cleaning tasks.Effective on Multiple Surfaces:The multi-surface design is a huge plus. I’ve used these towels on countertops, glass, stainless steel, and even wood with excellent results. They clean effectively without leaving streaks or lint behind, making surfaces look spotless and shiny.Soft and Absorbent:Despite their strength, these towels are soft and gentle on surfaces. They’re highly absorbent, quickly soaking up spills and messes. This combination of softness and absorbency makes them ideal for both kitchen and bathroom use.Reusable:One of the best features is that they can be rinsed and reused for light cleaning tasks. This not only makes them more economical but also reduces waste. I often use a single sheet multiple times before needing to dispose of it.Textured for Better Cleaning:The textured surface of these towels provides extra scrubbing power. This texture helps lift and trap dirt and grime, making cleaning more efficient. It’s particularly helpful for tackling sticky or stubborn messes.Convenient Size:The size of each sheet is just right for most cleaning jobs. They’re large enough to handle significant spills but not so big that they feel wasteful for smaller tasks. The roll fits standard paper towel holders, making it convenient to use and store.Reliable Performance:Whether I’m wiping down kitchen counters, cleaning up after a meal, or shining up bathroom fixtures, these towels perform consistently well. They’re versatile enough to handle a wide range of cleaning needs around the house.Great Value:For the quality and performance, Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels offer great value. They’re a bit more expensive than standard paper towels, but their durability and effectiveness make them worth the extra cost. You end up using fewer sheets overall, which balances out the price.Overall:Overall, Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels are a fantastic addition to any household cleaning arsenal. They’re strong, absorbent, and versatile, making them suitable for a variety of cleaning tasks.

Product: Viva Multi-Surface Cloth TaskSize Kitchen Paper Towels, White, 24 CountThis paper towel is Viva’s general purpose paper towel, it is not their cloth type paper towel. It is not as soft, but works better for wiping up or cleaning day-to-day surfaces.This paper towel is working great for my normal daily needs for a paper towel. It’s pretty absorbent. I’m not having any problems with lint when wiping down shiny surfaces like the front of my microwave. I don’t think it’s quite as thick as Bounty, but the price is a little less. I do find that the rolls last me longer than other paper towels in the same price range.It is mid-range in thickness and a bit on the rough side. It is lightly quilted, but has grooves over the entire surface which makes it good for cleaning up messes. These are task sized, so you can tear off the size you need, saving on your use.I’m happy with these for things like cleaning up messes and draining food. I don’t need fancy paper towels for those jobs.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

These aren’t for sensitive skin at all, the very first day my daughter used these her skin started getting bumps and she said it was burning, I just ended up making her y home made wipes with viva signature cloth paper towels cut in half and then put a little toasted sesame oil in middle of each one and then moistened with distilled water and used the container that wipes came in and she’s back to normal and the wipes I make even moisturize her skin and remove make up way better and bonus sesame oil is antibacterial too!! I should Jane just done that to begin with but I wanted her to have something extra to open for Xmas, lesson learned!

I used Neutrogena makeup removal wipe for the first time and my eyes are burning. At first I didn’t realize the burning pain was from the wipes. I used it again and was in pain immediately. I decided to Google search these wipes and I learned that there is a lawsuit against Neutrogena for this issue! Never using their wipes again! I used their eye makeup oil removal and have no issue.

Product and brand name good but now way over priced

I have been really disappointed the last 2 times I bought these. They used to be really moist and took off my eye make up easily. Last few times the towelettes have been really dry.  I have to use the outer edges and two at a time. I will not waste my money again.

Love the wipes themselves, great for taking off my makeup! I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this, though... I paid more because I thought I would get it with the container like the picture shows. Unfortunately just paid more money for a bag of the wipes. Would recommend purchasing a different listing than this one, as I could have ordered a 2 pack for just a couple of dollars more. Very misleading. Beware!

I made the mistake of ordering this little blue plastic box because it was so cute. The accompanying facial wipes were unfortunately NOT "Unscented."We have successfully used the "Unscented" Neutrogena Makeup Remover Facial Cleansing Towelettes because the Amazon “Belei” brand of Unscented wipes is no longer available.As soon as the package of wipes was opened - the fragrance was overpowering.And the entire lot went into the trashcan.

Item still sent in January as a care package for daughter working 12 hr. Shifts in ER.  Thought she could use a little TLC.  She never got around to telling me until the return window was closed.  As much as she truly appreciated the items in her care package these wipes were bone dry and quite useless.

Love the makeup cloths. Their so easy to use.

The quality of the container is horrible. It doesn’t close therefore drying what is inside.

Shockingly, this caused my skin horrible irritation.  After trying 2 of the remover wipes, I threw the entire package away.  After researching, there is currently a class action lawsuit pending due to this problem.  beware.

I'm not someone who ever paid attention to this kind of stuff so when I woke up the next morning after using these with my usually clear face COVERED in pimples I was shook. Turns out its not uncommon with this product.

They're not very sturdy – they tear when I use them – and they don't completely remove my mascara. Disappointed in these. I do better with eye makeup remover on pads for my mascara, and separate face cleansing wipes for removing my makeup.

My daughters face broke out from these wipes

I paid a little more because the listing picture indicated the plastic storage container was included. Don't be duped! It does not. DO NOT BUY THIS LISTING. This is over priced. Buyer beware.

It’s good for what it does, but you shouldn’t use makeup wipes! They don’t get all your makeup off, and are horrible for the environment! Try a cleansing balm or oil instead (I love the Clinique or zero ones)

The main reason I bought this combo was because of the box. The purpose was to.take the cloths out of the original packaging so they wouldn't dry as fast...no the box DOESN'T EVEN LATCH. So your wipes will dry out faster than using original packaging. Would not recommend.

Do not purchase. This is not the correct product. This is an off-brand falsely selling under the brand I sought to purchase. Made my skin completely break out. Do not purchase.

I’ve attached a photo that was taken at 4 am but my eyes were worse by morning. Not sure what chemicals are in these but horrible allergic reaction. I’m actually contemplating taking my daughter to urgent care since they keep getting worse.

Please know I love these makeup wipes but this product picture is false advertisement. No case is included. Returned and super disappointed.

Be careful if you order this, that it’s from a reliable distributor. I thought this was and it never came. The wipes themselves are amazing. But they have to arrive to be used.

Dried out. Waste of money.

I have used these before and they done good.  This time, the ones I received are not wet at all.  They are dry and will not take mascara off!!!

They use to work really good!!But these didn’t remove the makeup !!

I love Neutrogena wipes and will always use them, but I bought these specifically because of the box, but the box won't close so it's useless. Very disappointed.

These wipes don’t smell good, they make your hands and face feel oily when you use them, and the damned box won’t stay closed so they dry out super face.

I received my package today but came in dry.  Had to throw  it out.

The cloths barley have any product on them. It does an ok job at removing the makeup but it takes too many of them to do so.

I have ordered these nine times and have used Neutrogena wipes for years. This last order was NOT Neutrogena Wipes. They smell moldy and are drying to my skin. I will never order these again. I am throwing these in the trash.

The container is too small and doesn’t close a few days after I bought it

This is only the refills. There is NO container like the image. If I wanted the refills I would've bought the one that specifies refills. Thats totally manipulative. You can buy the refills only cheaper people.

It's too dry to remove makeup.. Right from opening the container, it feels like it's been opened for couple days. It's dry.

These particular wipes are awesome, but I ordered a 4 pack and got 3 loosely wrapped packs. They appeared to be used. No good!

Wipes are very very dry and do not remove make-up well or clean your face. Bad product.

Product description: "Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes 25 ct (Pack of 4)"What I was sent was 4 refills. You need to change the damn picture representation. It's misleading AF.

All in all too much scent!  Very hostile to sensitive sinuses and skin.  I am sure the non-scented ones would be better.

Lesson learned!  Always read reviews no matter the product.NOTE - THIS DOES NOT COME IN THE PLASTIC BOX AS SHOWN IN PIC. DRY OUT IN PACKAGING THAT DOES NOT CLOSE.

The container I ordered is of very poor quality. The kid doesn’t close tightly, which means the towelettes will dry out and become useless very quickly:(

I ordered a pack of four.  Instead I got 3 refill packs with 25 towelettes and then 4 of those annoying 7 towelette packages.  Those little packages always dry out.  Super annoyed.

I am extremely upset! I use these all the time and so do my daughters and it specifically said 4 packages of 25 wipes per package. Instead I got 15 individual packages. I am not happy!

I love these wipes, but i got this product specifically because i needed the container. now i have 4 packets and no container. #FALSEADVERTISEMENT

Did not include the plastic container featured in the ad. There is no mention in the ad that it is not included.

Always love using this stuff. But I ordered a 4 pack and they gave me a bunch of travel size packs instead! Those dry out so fast I feel like I got ripped off.

The wipes came dried out and I couldn’t even use them

It says on the box that it was supposed to be a four pack plus two travel packs and a container but only came with the four packs.

Just a wipe...didn't feel deep clean at all...

Sorry these wipes are old smell moldy would not use

The towelettes are all dried out, it is probably because they are old. Haven’t looked to see if they are expires or not.

Mines came dried out!

The media could not be loaded.
                



First reason I bought this makeup remover wipes was because they come in a box,wich a prefer instead of the plastic bags,but the box lead won't close so the wipes dry out..wipes are fine,nothing special, it does the job.

I take it on my travels. Gentle on under eyes.

If you're not going to use these face wipes constantly. Don't bother to purchase them. They dry out.

I usually get these for my wife. And I usually bought them from a another seller who I purchased them from regularily. But they did not have any available so I got these.. The packs were smaller for some reason and not the full size we are used to seeing. These do not seem as wet, and they do not remove the make-up as well as if they were fresh (she says). She also said these have a slight smell to them as well which is not usual. She is just not happy with these and we will see if we can get back to our reg seller of these.

I gave this product 2 starts overall because this item isn't as pictured. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing because this was mentioned buy another customer.  The actual towelettes work great! I have purchased at local stores and used them before with very good results. The issue is the packaging. They come in a "resealable" soft package. Well after opening the package several times the flap will come off and doesn't seal so great. Which brought me to this purchase. I paid more for these because the item pictured showed they were in a hard plastic closable container. This is NOT the case.  There wasn't even one hard plastic container that I could have refilled. As pictured above they all came in the same flimsy soft pack I can purchase anywhere. VERY disappointed with this purchase especially since I could have purchased these at a lower price elsewhere.

I have used Neutrogena products in the past and liked them, so I assumed these wipes would work well for me. I was wrong.They seem to do a decent job removing makeup and cleansing my skin, but they leave my skin feeling very oily. I have Sjögren's Syndrome, which means that I have very dry skin, so you would think that the extra oil would be welcome, but my skin couldn't absorb it, even after several hours. My mother, who has normal/combination skin had a very similar experience when she used the wipes on her own face. I am aware that certain oils are very effective at removing makeup, but these seem to be a little over-the-top.Then there's the fragrance... The main reason I that I dislike these wipes so vehemently is due to the fact that their fragrance reminds me of a bag of musty potpourri that I was surrounded by during a traumatic time in my life. Now, obviously, this is not Neutrogena's fault, but objectively I can say that it seems to be a weird fragrance choice for a beauty product.

I consistently purchase these as they are great when I travel for work.  I saw these and thought the plastic dispenser would be better for travel.  They are not in a plastic container, they are the same foil packages I always get, the photo is incorrect.

I was expecting to get the plastic container and only received the refills. After looking at other reviews just now, there have been many complaints about this. The listing pictures show the plastic container—it’s very misleading.

These are pre-moistened makeup removing wipes, but they are not damp enough to get all of the eye makeup and foundation off without using a couple of wipes each time.

If it is a sale they wanted then Neutrogena has succeeded.  I am a dad and did read the description and said 4 packs of 25 with the pic of the container.  It did not contain a pic of the product with only 4 packs.For $20 my daughter loves them but I was wondering if I should call the BBB on false advertising.  Probably won’t but disappointed with the advertising pic (is VERY misleading)SHOW THE CORRECT ITEM FOR SALE!!!!!Never stated in description this was a refill for displayed container

Perhaps I didn't read it fully but I expected a container that allowed you to just open the top and pull out one wipe.  It is just a container that you pop open and then have to open up the pack of wipes, pull one out, re-close the wipes and shut the container.  I don't need a container for the wipes.  They are already in their own container.

I feel like these wipes dry out way too fast. Other wipes I used do a better job.

They were very late by like 3 weeks and the were dried up by the time I got them

I usually purchase the Cetaphil face wipes to remove my makeup before washing my face because I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. They're really pricey though, and after seeing hundreds of rave reviews for these I thought they would be a great alternative. However, they are just too scented (maybe floral? I can't put my finger on it) and slightly too dry. I tried them maybe 5 times and will be returning to Cetaphil despite the price.

They are dry.. I ordered them before and it was the same but I thought I would give them another try they seem to be old and dry still.  It's  not the product i believe it's the shelf life

These made my sensitive skin red and irritated. I used these a couple of days before giving them to a friend. Simple brand is what I use now.

These are so flimsy.  I find i need at least 2 to make it work to remove the makeup.  Very disappointed in the quality.

The package was sealed upon delivery, but the wipes were almost bone dry!! Verydisappointing to say the least! I’ve had to use water with them and finally threw them away.

I likethe product itself,  however all 3 pictures show a plastic container to store them in. I did not recieve the tub...which I was really looking forward to using.  So I am upset because it does not come with tub.

I love this product when I first purchased from Costco, they worked so well. So soft and could get the makeup out so easily. And I found it on Amazon with free shipping and just a little more expensive than Costco and I just decided to try. But, I was disappointed. Don't know why the cloth is so hard on my skin and it did notremove the makeup nicely too... I guess I will buy from Costco next time instead of being lazy and order from Amazon....

I didn't think I would hate these, but I kind of do. They don't really remove the make-up very well. However, I do like the fact that I don't feel like I need to rinse of wash my face after using one of these.I do like the container they come in, though. I used the almay make-up remover towelettes before I bought these and I like them more. I feel as if they remove more make-up.

These are great at getting off your makeup, but I apparently have more sensitive facial skin than most people because they ended up drying out my face. If you have sensitive skin like me then look for a different product or make sure to moisturize really well afterward. I also wasn't a fan of the smell they left.

This product works well, but the packaging is NOT like the picture. It came in a soft package, and not the hard plastic case.

Wipes are great, box does not stay closed.

My wipes came ripped

Very disappointed. Although the plastic container is shown, it is not included.

I'm not sure why these get such good ratings.  If you wear a lot of eye make-up, I'd advise soap.  It will do a better job and take less time.

These were much drier than the ones I buy at the store. I had to wet them in the sink before use, which makes them less effective.

This product is my go to face wipe. Light scent, soft on your face and removes all makeup. Great value and quality!

I will not buy any other than Neutrogena even if others are cheaper.Love this and so does my face and eyes, especially ❣️❣️❣️

There is nothing to dislike about this makeup remover. It is extremely effective and easy to use.

No rinsing required. Feels clean. Skin seems happy. Sometimes it's just nice to not have to take time to wash and rinse and dry.

I bought these because if it's late and I'm too tired to wash my entire face with soap or soap substitute and water before bed. I wanted an option to at least remove my makeup before turning in.  With these, it's quick and easy to do that.  There are also other times when I just want to quickly refresh my face without washing it.  It does the trick quite well.I also find myself using one of these when putting makeup on.  Sometimes one doesn't quite get a perfect line on the eye or an area of shadow is smudged.  With a toweltte, I can quickly and remove the problem area or smooth it out.  I even sometimes put one over a pointed cotton swap for an area that requires more precise attention for removal or correction.For no or little extra cost this particular version of the Neutrogena towlettes comes with a storage box.  Even though the towlettes' packaging has a way to close the opening to prevent dehydration, the box is great for adding an extra layer to ensure that the towlettes don't dry out before you have a nice to use them.  It also has a nice clean look and a pleasant blue color, in case you want to leave them handy on your counter or vanity.The towlettes are also plant-based and compostable, which is great for the environment.The only issue I have with these towlettes is that they tingle my skin a bit, which is why I took off a star.  While that doesn't bother me for the other uses I have for them, I'd like something a little more gentle right before bed.  I'm planning to try Neutrogena's Night Calming Towelettes just for late night usage.  These are fine for daytime purposes for me.  I bought two so that I could have one in each of our bathrooms that I use.

I only wear eye make up occasionally, but these work well to remove it! They don’t make my face break out, or leave my face feeling oily.

They come with the box, so they're easy to use when traveling, they're a good size too! Easy to pack up or just leave on your vanity. They don't take up too much room. My daughter has very sensitive skin and these were super gentle on her skin.

I wish it didn’t come with the plastic container because it just seems unnecessary and I honestly don’t think it makes any difference in helping the wipes stay wet for longer. I ended up just using the container to store medicine for when I travel. As for the wipes, they are awesome. I’ve tried a few other brands and nothing compares - these are perfect for my sensitive skin.

I use these all the time. I did see a sale on a pack of 25 so I purchased two packs. I never received these in a plastic case like this .I do like the plastic case as a second option to keep them from drying out. However, these are not like the other packs where you can also reseal it with the original seal on the package. It doesn’t have a little sticky thing on it. I would really like this if that had  the second option.This  would not be good to travel with because it does take up quite a bit of room in a small toiletry bag. It’s better to buy the travel size or the wipes that have the resealable package as well as possibly the plastic case. Next time I’m going to buy the resealable packs, but keep these cases to store them at home!As far as how  effective the makeup remover wipes work, they are moist and do not require a lot of scrubbing to get most of the makeup off. I do have to work the waterproof mascara a little more and sometimes I have to use another makeup remover to get the residue off.These are gentle on skin and do not have any sting at all like some of the other ones do.I also use this when I’m putting on my make up to wipe off excess eyeliner, or concealer,lipstick,etc.For refererence, I am 69 years old, so I have been taking make up off a very  long time!

I enjoy these wipes and have purchased them for years. They really remove thick full coverage makeup and mascara. I recently purchased the mini individually packed version of these and now prefer those. I find that these wipes dry up towards the end of the box. Let’s face it you can re constitute them with water, but they aren’t cheap. They do leave your face very hydrated and happy 😊

I purchased these face wipes because the regular casing never seems to stay closed and the wipes dry out. I thought this would be better. Waste of money. There's no reason to spend the extra money purchasing these face wipes with the plastic container when the container doesn't even stay shut. Extremely disappointed. Might as well save money and just purchase the regular face wipes without the container. The face wipes themselves are good, that's the only reason I didn't give this product 1⭐.

The wipe itself seemed to be good quality and it smelled good (floral scented), but it just kind of pushed my makeup around instead of removing or dissolving it. I used it to try to get my Nyx brand vinyl style eyeliner off and it just made a mess. The equate (Walmart brand) makeup wipes worked better than these for a fraction of the price.

I was disappointed that it was not packaged as shown with the hard case. The open and shut feature is not well made.

It’s just a refill in a hard case. It doesn’t dispense from the case. You will have to get the refill out and then put it back in the case.

So it burns my eyes sometimes and it can get bad. And also when I use the wipes I also can't put make up on again for a while because the resude doesn't dry and went I put on make up before it dries it smudges the make up :/

The makeup remover wipes work as described.  I am impressed how it even takes off mascara.  I don't personally like the inner packaging, its a little difficult to get them out and separate them, I wish they came out more like a kleenex does.  I also don't care for how my face feels after I use them.  My face doesn't feel greasy, but its doesn't have the dame freshness that it would if I had washed my face with an actual cleanser.The bottom line is that the towelettes do take off makeup.  I certainly wouldn't use this product daily or replace my normal cleansing routine with it, but when I can't wash my face or need to quickly take off my makeup, these work good.

I didn’t like how they show a picture of the product in a plastic container, but didn’t provide the container. I just received the wipes. I was really expecting atleast one pack of wipes to be in that container so I could recycle the plastic container when that one pack of wipes runs out. However, I did receive all 6 packs of wipes.

I actually got this cause si wanted to have the case to put my replacement towels. It came with a bag of towels but I guess they were stored for a long time cause they were a little bit dry. Other than that I like this

I've been using this product forever, however the box I received said "5 refills plus 1 travel size" and I only received 4 refills.3 stars for the product but obviously the packaging and handling of this is questionable.

The remover itself is good, but somehow the flap doesn’t close properly... I bought this one particularly because I wanted to get its reusable container to prevent the remover to set up though. Bummer :/

The description is deceiving on this product. I wanted to purchase a bag of individual wipes to carry in my purse and store in the guest washroom. However, these were sent instead which are packaged in quantities of 25 each. The wipes are very good, I just wish the product description was more clear.

My face to remove makeup but it seemed dry and not deep clean remover.

I like this product; however, when ordering the picture shows a blue box with refills.  No blue box came just the refills.  Disappointing.  How do you get the storage box with this product?

These seemed to be pretty standard face wash pads to me and did their job when I got them. I kept them inside the blue plastic box they came in but they kept drying out in there. It was too the point i would have to remove the first 2 or 3 pads to get one that was moist. Was hoping to keep the box to store future washing pads but it has since proved unreliable to me. The actual pads work great though

I don't know if this is particular to the package I received, but I found the towelettes to be relatively dry -- so they felt rough on my skin. Also, I thought the plastic container was a dispenser but it is literally just a box that holds the wipes package. I suppose that's still helpful, and I shouldn't have assumed, but I bought this product because I wanted a dispenser. I will be sticking to Garnier.

These are very soft and nicely packaged but I don't have sensitive skin and these legitimately make my skin burn. No thanks! I wouldn't buy these again.

Wipes are fine. The box seems a lil too big for the wipes it comes with so it’s wasted space in my drawer. Also, the life could be move convenient.

Top didn't close and they immediately dried out. Love the product not the box.

I love the wipes but when you get to the end of the package it does not seal therefore, the wipes dry out. Any suggestions??

These were completely dried out when I opened them.

My favorite wipes so I thought it’d be nice to have a little container but it came broken.

Product advertised with box. Received 4 refills instead - without boxes.

the box is an accessory that I can use for other things. the box contains the towelettes in a packet. the towelettes are bigger than they need to be to cleanse makeup

Loved having the refillable container

I bought this thinking that I wouldn't have ONE that stayed dry on top. I was so excited to get it! It came with a sealed package of wipes. I opened my older package and stuck it in. There is so much space left over, I would never take this camping the liquid comes out of the container. :-\ I don't know, I think I am gonna use it but... Meh

These make me break out if I don't wash my face immediately after using them, which, for me, sort of defeats the point.

works better than my old brand

They're ok I guess.  Just dries out too fast.

Dont like at all.  Had a horrible odor!!

Fast shipping. Arrived as described.

Good product but too expensive.

Feel good on face.

I was expecting the refill container to function more like a refillable container of baby wipes.  It seems like they may still dry out if I remove the seal on the wipes? The wipes seem to take a bunch of makeup off, until I use a cotton ball and toner. The cotton ball will end up full of makeup. The scent is wonderful and not irritating to my sensitive skin.

Got it on time like it but the fact that it is in the container it still dried out the sheets was dry after a small amount of time

This makeup remover smells very strongly of unpleasant chemicals that gives you the feeling of a rash just by smelling it. It also doesn't get eyeliner off very well and you have to scrub which obviously irritates and reddens your skin. If you get it in your eye it doesn't sting, so that's good. Also, the box can be reused. Allover, 3 stars!

It took several cloths to remove makeup and then I would still have to scrub to get the makeup off

It’s so small

Although the cleaning wipes got most of the makeup off, after rubbing quite a few times, it felt a bit oily.

Works good !

I found that this product is very good in all aspect did not dry my skin out. Great for traveling. I would buy again.

The product is good I meant to buy fragrance free wipes I didn’t pay attention to what was I buying.

These makeup remover wipes do a pretty decent job removing waterproof mascara and 24 hour lipstick. Good size. Nice thickness. Not wet and drippy. No breakouts. Not greasy. Doesn’t evaporate and dry out before you finish using. Don’t need to wash your face with soap and water after using.  I’m unsure why there’s need to put them in a non-airtight container because the bag/packaging needs to be resealed between uses anyhow to keep moist. Multi-pack is more cost effective.

The cloths are large, soft and nicely moistened.  If I wore more make up, I'd have to use 2 cloths.  They don't irritate my skin which has happened with other wipes.  I will purchase again.

I have tried several make-up remover towelettes and I like these best.  I take them out of the plastic packaging and keep them in the blue box and they don't dry out at all.  I don't find the scent to be any problem at all.  These really do a great job removing all your makeup, including your eye makeup and mascara.  Because these are advertised as also being a cleanser, I did a little test.  After I used one to remove my makeup, I then washed my face lightly using my regular face towelette.  There was no sign of any make up on my cleansing towelette as there would be using other brands of remover.  No residue whatever!  I gave a 4 star rating because I wish the towelette was just a little bigger.  Other than that I recommend them.  I get these delivered to me regularly through my subscription so I never run out!

love the velvety feel on my skin the smooth texture soothes the skin as you remove the days make up leaving a damp cool feeling. refreshing!

The only bad thing was is the box had a big crack in it !! Idk if it was damaged during shipping or damaged before shipping…

I really like these makeup removers and especially appreciate the plastic box they come in because it helps the sheets not dry out. I will definitely keep the box for future wipes I purchase. They are a little more pricey than what I normally buy but honestly totally worth the cost since they are so good with my sensitive skin and take of layers of makeup in just minutes. They won't grab everything on the first go (especially eye makeup) but they are much more effective than many of the other brands I've used in the past. I wish the pack was just a little bigger but all in all I'm extremely satisfied with this product.

The issue I had with these was they are drying out just a bit as the package goes down. Typically they last longer. Hmmm

My only complaint is that the product illustration appeared to me to include a container for the cleaning pads.  Guess I didn’t read closely enough, but I would love to have a container.

Feeling very slick and like residue on your face

I love Neutrogena makeup remover towelettes and have used them for years.  I have great skin and these help keep my skin moisturized.  But this package was pretty dried out when I opened it.  I added a little water to the towelettes, but usually this is not necessary.  Maybe these had been in a warehouse too long.

Takes off make up well, no real scent, reasonable price

I've always loved Neutrogena make up wipes. They clean very well!

I’ve used them today and they were very soft and even moisturizing but more like a serum to some affect. My skin is super sensitive but I was surprised to see it didn’t affect me too much.

These makeup remover wipes are amazing. The plastic container is very easy to use and I love the scent. They work perfectly on sensitive skin. However, they are very “slimy” and it takes a while for the skin to dry.

I love these makeup wipes. The wipe itself is very gentle and isn’t scratchy like others I have used in the past. The solution the wipe is covered in breaks down even waterproof mascara. My skin feels makeup free after using. My only complaint is the container would not stay sealed. It is plastic and it just wouldn’t stay closed. If I had completely removed the seal from the makeup package, the wipes would have dried out completely. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, I just wish that the container would function properly.

Their really good at removing makeup and it has a good smell but sometimes it can just be a little overwhelming like it feels that you are wiping a perfume wipe on your your face but other than that their good

wish there were more in a box

If you use Neutrogena pads to remove your make-up then you already know what they do and what they do not do.These towelettes are great for surface makeup removal but they absolutely do NOT get out anything that gets deeper into the pores. You will need an exfoliating pad or another cleanser. They are odorless and work great for touch-ups as well.

It doesn't matter how thick your eyeliner is with these wipes it'll come offPinky promise :>

It smells really good! As of its wiping qualities , it doesn’t clean any better than regular or flushable baby wipe but costs much more. If you don’t want to save money, then continue using these. Btw, baby wipes come in hypoallergenic form for sensitive skin.

I can buy this product in the stores but opted online because it shows the container.  That WAS NOT included.  I am very disappointed.  I do not want to bother sending back but would like to know how to get the container to put them in.

Made my face break out too harsh. Wish there were ones for sensitive skin. Love the concept though.

This product works very well. It is a little greasy, but that's ok. It doesn't have a powerful scent. It cleans very well, and gives your skin a radiant glow. It also make your skin look more youthful. Worth the price.

Works fairly well for getting that top layer of makeup off. This doesn't quite get all of my eye liner off and I still find myself using eye makeup remover for that area. I don't really like the feel of the chemicals on my skin but it's meant to be used just before a proper face wash anyway, so it's not that bad. I've started using it primarily for makeup application, wiping my cheeks of eye shadow fall out before I apply foundation. Works great for that!

The product received was not what is pictured. What I received was 6 boxes  of individually wrapped folded wipes.  I love the wipes but wanted the holder to store the wipes in.  Will be more careful next time.

The wipes are too dry. I find generic brands are wetter and clean better.

Arrived quickly. No container, just 6 refill packs. Great price for the number of refill packs--comparable to Costco prices. I have a container and didn't really want another one so it worked out for me but if you're hoping for a container you may be disappointed.

This is my go-to product and I have repurchased many times. I use a wipe before I wash my face every night. The only complaint I have is that the sticky tab’s glue wears away fast and the pack can dry out if you’re not careful

They work great! Thought they also came with a small to go pack, but mine only came with the large packs. Would recommend. The only thing I learned is that you should put the pack in a container of sorts so they don’t dry out.

handy and works great! The smell is a little strong but nice. I use it to remove all makeup, works wonder on mascara, then I clean my face as usual as this does leave a little film on your face. If I'm short on time I have just used the towelettes and gone to bed - no issues ever. Has never caused irritations or breakouts - if the smell was toned down just a smidge it would be 5 stars!

It took off my water proof makeup great!!!!!!!

I can easily take off all my makeup with just 1 wipe.

Great wipes, but plastic container won't stay closed

I should’ve read the reviews before purchasing. Does NOT include container which is what I wanted to order. I do love this product though.

My wife asks me to buy these instead of the generic or store brands because they're so much better and they are. I've seen firsthand how they clean much more efficiently than the others.

These worth well for removing makeup without crying out my skin. They have a slight odor I am not a fan of, but other than that I have no complaints.

I love these makeup remover wipes because it seems to effortlessly wife off your makeup without the alcohol smell and making your skin dry. In fact, my skin feels very moisturized after using it. I have dry skin so the fact that no harsh alcohols are used in this product is incredibly refreshing.I will definitely buy this product again.

They work well for removing makeup. However, they sometimes cause irritation around my eye area and it's uncomfortable.

I received only 3 packs 25 count and 3 7 count packs and a small bottle of bodywash I won't use , but other than that it was okay .

They do the job at night to remove eye make up

I use the product to take off my face makeup.  It's a very effective product it takes off all of my face makeup

I love the fact you get 4 boxes, quality is good. It’s just a lil pricy compared to other stores.

They are easy to open. I love that they come in a container for an extra security of them not drying out. They are thick and soft. Definitely a valuable purchase. I do prefer scent free.

Best one in market !

Easily takes off my eye makeup including hard to remove waterproof mascara with ease. These are great for travel as well. No reaction to my skin.

& they work as intended

Removes all makeup with one wipe!I highly recommend 👍

Would buy again

These are super convenient. I usually tare a sheet in half and put the other half back into the plastic casing for the next day or use. These wipes are always moist, I have never received a pack that wasnt and they last for a long time especially if you tar them in half like I do. They smell good, not too strong and they are not greasy at all or they also dont leave your face with any type of film or sticky, slimyness. On top of all that I LOVE that it comes in a little plastic case. I use the case's for other things afterwards like my Q-tips or to store my pads when I went on a trip, so it comes in handy.

Cleans skin and leaves your face feeling soft, not gritty. I use these all the time

Ive been using these forver and I like them, however I just started using retinol and they kinda burn if Ive recently put the retinol on. thats not the wipes fault though just a word of caution

These cloths are large and thick. I wear plenty of foundation and mascara, and one cloth is enough to take it all off. The hard plastic box that they come in is worth the price.

I like the individual wrap because when I travel I can take just what I need.

Best makeup remover wipes ever!!!

They remove your make up well and It doesn’t break out your face

LOVE THESE Neutrogena Makeup Remover wipes!  They remove the makeup, and yet are calming to my sensitive skin-NO STINGING! I like the container they come in as well. I keep them by the  tub/shower , so the container keeps them dry & fresh. I’ve even used the container to store other makeup wipe brands , when I ran out of  Neutrogena.

Feels great to remove makeup and clean face .

This is a brand of make up wipes. I’ve always used. However, I liked the idea of having a container. Sometimes in the shower they get dried up. This container holds very tight and does not let any water in.

Love these wipes

Works as described

Gentler than a lot of face wipes. Removes makeup well.

Love the way this takes everything off and leaves my face feeling clean.and not dry. Good for mature skin like mine. Scent is nice too. Really appreciate the container they came in as well to keep the wipes from drying out.

I love these and it’s so good love the box they came in and so worth the money for it I bought 2 and it came the next day I’m so buying more for sure

Works efficiently

Travel back is perfect. Keeps towels moist.

I love this product, takes all markup off throughly , even eye makeup.  No oily residue

Bought these just for the little container. They’re the same normal wipes.

Hard to find in a plastic carrying case.  These were great.  Just whay my WIFE wanted.

Love this product true to size

Nice cooling makeup remover wipes. Makeup is removed quickly.

Easy use, no heavy perfume smell

I love these make up remover wipes. My go to after a long day and shaping my eyebrows

Love these

It’s hard to find wipes that come with a container, so I keep buying these and sometimes refill with other types so I have a line up of face wipes to choose from lol :DOne of my teen daughters has eczema and sensitive skin, and these work great for her. I have aging, somewhat oily skin, and these don’t give me a bad reaction, and they do a good job of making my skin cleansed and not dried out. The smell is very subtle, sometimes I add rose absolut oil to them to feel extra pampered :)I’ll keep buying these, with or without the bonus of the container, these are just perfect!

At my ancient age, I can’t often say “I’ve used this all my life.”  But in this case, it’s true.  I don’t think there’s anything better on the market for ten times the price.

Good product

Always use these wipes!

I am satisficed with the product.

I’ve used these for years and they work wonderfully.

This gets all the makeup off even waterproof with one wipe!

Love the container that way it doesn't dry out your wipes~

This brand is the go to....removes 99% of dirt, oil, and sunscreen. Cleans into your deep pores very delicately! ~Keith. 😄

I was excited to try these, especially because the description said it would remove waterproof mascara.  I could understand if it wouldn't remove 100% of it.  But after using it at bedtime, I woke up the next morning with racoon eyes.  I continue to use them instead of throwing them (and money) away but I really have to scrub at the eyelashes to get the mascara off.  Disappointed.

I love using these makeup remover wipes because they don't leave any makeup on my face. Although, they irritate my skin just a little. Not enough to make me stop using them. The texture is nice and they are easy to use. They smell fine. The wipes don't dry up quickly.Edit: If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT USE! I have been using these for about 1 week and a half and IT BURNS! It feels like someone is pouring lava on your face. The picture is not as red as it is in person. Please do not buy if you have sensitive skin.

Many scents do not agree with me. Normally, I make sure I purchase unscented things. I missed checking for scented vs unscented on these and ended up with a double pack of scented towelettes. I used one and had a migraine all day. Now I have a double pack that I cannot use. I'll give them to someone whose scent tolerance is better than mine.

I have used various makeup wipes and/or water based makeup removers for over 20 years without an issue but these wipes caused my eyes to swell shut!!Within minutes of using this product my eyes started burning, watering, and eventually started to swell up.I do not have sensitive skin. I have used all types of wipes and solutions to remove eye makeup and never once experience a reaction.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!

I usually buy these in the store so decided to buy it here because they were a bit cheaper. These are not the same. They are so thin and dry and well, subpar. I will need to use two instead of one so what a waste of money. I will go back to buying them from the store. Don’t waste your money here.

This product is not fragrance free.  IT is mislabeled and not returnable. I fought my way through to chat with an Amazon rep.  And got one package replaced. Despite assurances from the rep, the replacement was not fragrance free either.  BUY LOCALLY, if possible.  the seller gets zero stars.  And Amazon gets zero starts for making it so difficult to reach a rep and for not solving the issue.

I have used this product for years purchasing it at CVS and the past 3 years subscribing to it via Amazon. It was an unbeaten product (I did try other product wipes over the years but always came back this product). The Neutrogena wipe product has, however, changed this past year.The Neutrogena wipe no longer cleans the skin softly and easily. Part is because the wipe is not as thick and soft anymore and therefore does not hold the moisture as well. Part because the wipe is just simply rough now.The new wipe claims to be "gentle" on the skin "effectively lifts away 99% of makeup." This description was accurate for the previous wipe design, but unfortunately no longer. When cleaning my face with this new wipe, I have to scrub my face with the wipe to remove make-up that previously simply lifted off. I have neither changed my foundation nor my treatment makeup products.I am very disappointed with the change of this product and will no longer subscribe to or otherwise purchase the product.

Having been disappointed by the deteriorating quality of Neutrogena face wipes, I picked up a package of Kroger house brand wipes recently.  They are SO much better--thicker and sturdier with no shredding.  I plan to give Neutrogena's product one more try, but if the product continues to lack decent quality, I will bid it buh-bye for good.  It's great that they are climate-conscious, but the product also needs to do what it is advertised to do.  Currently, it doesn't.This was once a high-quality makeup remover wipe.  When I opened the package I ordered about a month ago, I noticed that the first two sheets were, literally, shredded.  This has recurred randomly throughout the package of 30.  I'm hoping it was just a one-off manufacturing error but, if not, I won't be buying this brand again although I've used it for many years.  The wipe was also very thin, as though the specifications have changed.

I’ve USED TO love these wipes, they were my go-to for years but something changed.  I usually buy in bulk but the last few times I’ve ordered I’ve noticed that they’re really irritating and burn my eyes which is odd since I’ve never had sensitive skin.  I’ve thought that my irritation could be due to trying new eye creams from Ipsy over the last year or so but even after stopping those and rarely wearing makeup these days, when I use these wipes instead of micellular water the skin around my eyes burn and get dry and flaky over the day or two. After doing research I’ve learned that there was actually a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT for this exact reason!!! I don’t know what changed in their formula but be warned! I really have no clue how these are still on the market.

I was a die hard fan of these until I realized in the last year THIS is what was causing all my skin problems. I went to an aesthetician recently and she explained how the preservatives in these to keep them moist is the worse thing for your skin. I’m turning 40 this year and have sworn these off two months ago and switching little by little to all vegan and cruelty free products. The change just by not using these wipes has been like WOW. Every day I would remove my makeup after work and my face would flare up so ugly and red and itchy. Never put together it was these wipes and not my makeup or stress.

Value for money can not be determined, because product does not take off all makeup even if one uses two. Is easy to use and gentle on skin. Smell is fine. Quality is mediocre. Price is low, but does not do everything it says.

These makeup remover pads have a big smell! I had to run wash my face and hands off and I didn’t want to even walk through the house until I got that smell off!!Can’t return them and can’t figure out if I can get a refund - I am sure not going to use them!

I have used these for years as part of my nighttime removal of makeup. They have changed the wipes to much smaller and VERY THIN material so you need 2 wipes now….Also the new formula really burns my eyes…sad but I will not buy this product going forward.

I've used Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes for years and been very happy with them.  This plant-based formula, however, gave me a facial rash and caused my eyes to burn.  I will not buy them again.

I used this Friday night to remove my makeup and immediately started feeling a burning sensation. I tried washing my face with cold water but it didn't stop the reaction.  Saturday morning I woke up with terrible chemical burns on my face.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!

I bought these because they were advertised by Amazon as "fragrance free." I'm allergic to a lot of fragrances and typically like Neutrogena products, yet when I used them I had an allergic reaction and had to use my inhaler for my asthma. I looked at the package and sure enough "fragrance" is listed as one of the ingredients. If you look at the EPA's definition of fragrance free it means "fragrance materials or masking scents are not used in the product." This is false advertising and it is very disappointing.

I used these all over my face to remove my makeup. It felt a little tingly while using but I didn't think much of it. When I got to wiping off my eye makeup it did start to feel worse but again wasn't enough in the moment to second guess using the wipe. Over the next two days my eyelids started peeling and left raw. Yea.... not a pleasant feeling and was miserable. I've never had to use sensitive skin products but goodness gracious this stuff was potent. Don't buy if you possibly do have sensitive skin.

The cleaning solution that is on these feels yucky on my face. I didn’t feel like my face was clean after using one. I tossed the package! I very soap works great for me.♥️

I have been using these makeup remover wipes for well over 9 years.  I was so unhappy to learn that they changed everything about them and I will not be buying them anymore.  First, they changed the material of the wipe, so it tears very easily and they may be a bit smaller than before.  They are thinner too (less thick).  Second, the formula itself changed because it stings my eyes now and they never used to do that.  They also changed the size of the hole that the wipe is pulled through.  Overall, a serious downgrade and I will be looking for a new makeup remover wipe.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it Neutrogena!

I bought these to use for travel so they are not my normal make up remover— I used them and in one day has such an awful break out!!! I stopped using them on the trip and thr break out stopped! Idk what I had a reaction to in these but with so many positive reviews for these i wanted to let people know the product isn’t a slam dunk for all!Also, I don’t care for how much you have to rub the wipes to remove make up- I think it’s too harsh for skin

It's slimy business to change the quality of your product to save money. The "new and improved" formula burns my eyes, and doesn't work. I've been using this product for 15+ years, and have paid a premium for it because Neutrogena had the best product. No more. Inflation is high, so if your margins are so tight , give me 15 makeup pads that work instead of 25 awful ones that burn my eyes. I've spoken to my mom about this in a different state and several friends that confirmed this, so this isn't just my specific pack. Extremely disloyal to do this to your lifelong customers!

I used to love these wipes before they made them plant based. They were super soft, removed all make up and smelled wonderful. Since they made them plant based, they don't smell nice, they are rough and not nearly the experience of the original, that I had used for years. Wish they'd switch back to the original formula for these.

Purchased this three pack in January but didn’t open first pack till 2 months ago.At around the same time, I started experiencing irritation and itching on my neck and cheeksAbout 2 weeks ago, I happen to catch a comment from another Amazon purchaser showing pictures of a severe skin rash. She stated that it was due to the use of these facial cleansing pads and urged the reader to google for further info.  I did and was shocked at the amount of postings from people experiencing the same irritation.I had finished one pack and had started using  my second pack so I didn’t ask for a refund....just tossed what was left in the trash.I have since ordered a different brand and the skin irritation is no more.Buyer beware...

An allergic reaction to these wipes left me with horrible chemical burns, several doctors visits and hundreds of dollars later, still treating and hoping I will not be left with long term post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The pain was excruciating and debilitating. Making it difficult to work or focus on anything because of the intense itching. It will likely take a long time to recover. I can’t exercise because I can’t get too hot and can’t even enjoy hot showers because it causes the reaction to flare.

I was so excited to get these, and so disappointed after I did.  The first night I cleaned my face and eyes with one.  Then I picked up my white washcloth to take any residue off, and to my disappointment, there was a lot of makeup on the washcloth!  The next night, I used 2 of the cloths, and same thing - my white washcloth had makeup and mascara on it.  They just don't do the job - SO disappointed!  There was no irritation, I like the "scent" or lack thereof, but even using 2 of them my face was not clean.  I will probably travel with them as they help reduce the amount of makeup I am leaving on washcloths, but I am looking for something else.  I wont buy these again.

The explanation of the product says unscented and antibacterial, these are heavily scented and there is no need for antibacterial face wipes.  I am unable to use this highly perfumed product with my asthma.  I was very disappointed.

Just opened the package brand new and the first wipe is covered with black stuff?? You can see the black through the package too.. no idea what it is.. maybe mold? Idk gross

I have used neutrogena wipes for years, but bought these recently and now have a terrible contact dermatitis on my eyelids. They’re super dry, burning/stinging, and inflamed. Apparently there is a class action law suit against neutrogena for many clients having similar reactions. Do not buy

I’ve been using these for YEARS, and was even pleased with buying them on Amazon, but they are not even close to the original Neutrogena wipes! Almost everything about them is different:  Different material…now they are super rough instead of soft.  Different amount of moisture…now they are dry instead of moist.  I have to add a few drops of water each time I use them to avoid tugging on my skin.  Different smell…these stink like a sickening chemical…they were pleasantly scented before. I will not waste my money on them again…on Amazon or in my local stores.

This new and improved wipe is not improved!! Why mess with perfection? I loved the old wipes and used them for years and they were super hydrating. These burnt my face and dried out my skin terribly on first use. Second try was even worse and left redness around my eyes for hours. Had to toss both packs. Guess I’ll be searching for a new wipe after all these years. Very disappointed. I understand the reason for the change was to help the environment, however you can’t do that at the expense of selling a harmful product! Very disappointed in neutrogena!

Purchased this product 8 times before; my 9th purchase (using “buy again” button) was delivered and  immediately noticed the packaging was different; the website changed the product from:Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Face Wipes, Daily Cleansing Facial Towelettes to Remove Waterproof Makeup and Mascara, Alcohol-Free, Value Twin Pack, 25 Count, 2 PackWebsite now shows as:Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Face Wipes, Daily Cleansing Facial Towelettes Remove Makeup & Waterproof Mascara, Alcohol-Free, 100% Plant-Based Fibers, Value Twin Pack, 25 count, 2 pkNot returnable and I have no idea how my skin will react to  “now better than ever” plant based product.

I get these sent on an auto shipment in the past they were 7.4“ x 7.2“ now they are 7.2“ x 6.4“ and are made of a plant-based compostable towelette. They are not the same and the packaging looks like it comes from China although it says “distributed by“ Johnson and Johnson. I am sending these back and canceling my subscription with Amazon.  I tried to take a picture but Amazon would not let me just give it access to my camera it wanted access to all of my pictures as well. Heck no!

Leaves my face feeling greasy. I have to rewash my face with soap and water.

I have used Neutrogena for years but not this specific item. It is very oily and I developed eye irritation.

I don’t know what happened to this formerly delightful product!  It was so effective and had a very neutral and light scent. Now the wipes are not effective at cleaning / removing makeup and they have a stronger, unpleasant scent. I’ve tried to Google to understand why Neutrogena changed this product and can’t find any information.  Needless to say I have a bulk order of this in my vanity that will eventually get tossed, and will be actively looking for its replacement. Any suggestions, please send them my way!

I've used these Neutrogena wipes for years and then they changed them to plant based and I started having itchy, raw and irritated eyes. I thought it was something else at first but then finally narrowed it down to these wipes. Whatever they've done has now caused some type of allergic reaction.  Time to find another product because they don't give you a choice, you simply get this plant based product.

I've used the original wipes for many years and never found any I liked better. Ran out of last bulk order and re-ordered and got the new formula for the first time. The wipes are a rougher texture and the makeup remover is not the same. It does not remove eye makeup like the old formula did. (Unfortunately I also appear to have a sensitivity to something in the new formula, as it left my skin itchy and red and triggered a systemic allergic response.)

So I decided to buy these wipes from Amazon about 3 days ago after I had borrowed when I spent the night at a friends house.... I loved how they took off my make up... BUT.....These wipes hurt so bad! I used them 2 times and oh my goodness!!! Dried out my skin soooo much, especially around my eyes and mouth. Literally took my skin off... my skin was BURNING and red!! I DO have sensitive skin, and I just canceled the delivery! They were suppose to arrive today!! There NEEDS to be a warning on this product! Absolutely awful! Hurts really bad. Seriously.

New formula has a very strong perfume smell. Thirty minutes after using on my face I began to feel my eyes swelling & burning. I also noticed the skin around my nose drying out. I have used the old Neutrogena wipes for years with no issue. I thought that was what I ordered but the new formula showed up instead. Not recommend for sensitive skin. I also have to note the new “plant based compostable” claim, based on the very strong new fragrance & ingredients listed I find that suspicious.

I recently bought these at Ulta. They have been my go-to for years and light years better than any other brand. NOW, they are awful. They smell bad, are not soft anymore, dried out my skin, and worst of all you have to tug at your skin to get the makeup off!!!! I am absolutely devastated about this. I don't need a biodegradable face wipe; i need one that WORKS, especially for my sensitive skin! Shame on Neutrogena. This is a big miss and a bad mistake.

If this is for sensitive skin, is hate to see what the regular wipes do to someone with sensitive skin! Within minutes of using, my face and eye lids were red, burning and itching. I should have read the reviews before purchasing, but since it's used these years ago without issue, I didn't. As others have said, they must have changed the formula. Regardless, I had to wash my face several times to stop the burning. The redness and itching persisted for a while, though. I threw them away and won't be buying this brand again!

Not happy. They have a strong scent - it maybe natural from the ingredients used- but it still has a scent. I am VERY sensitive to smells and I cannot use these. I get migraines from scents.Very disappointed and they can not be returned.

Not happy. Both packets were totally dried up. Unfortunately I'm past my 30 days to return. I didn't expect I needed to check this when I received. Who'd a figured they'd be bad!I'd like the seller to replace but when trying to send seller feedback it wouldn't give me the option.Let's hope they read this and contact me. I'll keep ya posted if anything changes.But for now I guess I just wasted my money. Uggghhh.Update: 9/26/16I do want to say this actual product works well - If it's the actual product you buy at a store. These are not the same.I still haven't heard back from seller about replacing the dried up packs I received.

I have always taken really good care of my skin and just wanted a simple makeup wipe because it's just easy. But this product burned my skin and destroys my skin barrier. I am still dealing with the issues. It's straight up like rubbing alcohol on your face. DONT BUY IT.

I have loved these for years and now I get a stinging  rash on my face and my eyelids peel. Have to use something else. Disappointed and with they would go back to the old recipe.

These wipes irritated my skin around the eyes. I always trusted Neutrogena, but I will not be buying these wipes again. and they were so expensive—over $10 for only 50

Do NOT buy this if you have sensitivities to fragrance.  The perfume smell is so strong, I could not use it.  The description says "Unscented" but when I received the product, I found that "fragrance" is listed on the ingredients.  I tried to get my money back, but the seller would not allow it.  This was a waste of money.

Advertised as fragrance free and these are not those . Sucks because I have extremely sensitive skin and these irritate it because I as I open it you can smell the scent they are the original . I already opened the pack and noticed how strong the scent was.

Product is fine. Delivery is always late

These wipes took off all of my makeup with very little pressure on my face, eyebrows and eyelashes.  Additionally, my skin felt so soft,  smooth, and pampered afterwards, as if it had been conditioned by a facial. These are going to be my new, go to wipes. Additionally, the wipes r thick and of large size enough that you can hold them well in your hand. One wipe was durable enough to clean my face, neck and my chest.

These work great and I'm so glad they came with the extra night wipes because I hadn't ever tried them before-> and they smelled great! My daughter loves these because they take off her mascara.

These makeup remover wipes made my face feel clean witjout scrubbing. Removed my eye makeup with ease. No irritationor redness after using them. Smell great and are a perfect size and thickness. The reusable container seals back with ease and has great adhesive glue. Will purchase again.

These wipes are the OG and have been around forever because they do the job and remove makeup very well. However, they make my skin feel like its burning. It's not just for a few seconds either. I tried them at 18 years old, skin burned. Tried a new pack now that I'm almost 31, still burns. It sucks because they are a good price and work well, but it's not worth the burning for me.

I’ve been using Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes for a while now, and they’ve always been my go-to for taking off makeup.

It doesn’t cause irritation, definitely getting bang for your buck. Doesn’t leave your skin dry. Removes make up without excessive rubbing or passing.

I've tried other brands and they are too dry.  These clean well and don't have a weird residue. I like the scent, doesnt bother my skin. Great price, fast delivery. I'll never go off brand again!!

These wipes are exactly what I was looking for. The apartment complex was having some water issues, so these are an absolute must when you don't have access to water when you need to remove the makeup before bed, in case it happens again. Either case, I'll continue to use them regardless of the water issue cause they work. No more scrubbing of the eyes to make sure you got off all the mascara and eye liner. One wipe and done. I really love Neutrogena products. No fragrance but a leaves a little sticky feeling afterwards, no worries, I just refresh my face with water after. Will purchase again.Thank You Amazon!!

I've been using this brand of make-up removal wipes for years. I absolutely love them. They work incredibly well, even with waterproof mascara.They leave my skin dewy, moisturized, gently exfoliated, and free of make-up and environmental debris. If I didn't use waterproof mascara, 1 wipe can clean my entire face.I follow up with toner and a moisturizer or syrup before bed each night. I'm 44 with aging skin, yet everyone guesses me to be in my early 30s. Cannot recommend these wipes enough for a wonderful base to a healthy skin cleaning routine.

When traveling, bringing along these Makeup Remover Face Wipes, I found that they couldn't completely remove the makeup.

I've been using these for years but the new formula is awful!  Perhaps it was when they switched to compostable material, as advertised on the packaging?  They used to be so soft and moist... now they are scratchy, I use these for eye makeup removal and it now hurts the delicate skin around my eyes!  Also not nearly as wet.  Also the smell isn't the same, now smells more medicine-y. Just so much worse all the way around.  I honestly used to love these and bought them like, a dozen packs at a time.  It makes me so sad that I now have to search for a totally different brand.  I will use up the ones I purchased but not buying any more.  Neutrogena please go back to the old formula!  I'm guessing must be cheaper for them to make them this new way... :(

Too dry! It takes a lot of pads to clean.

Didn't remove eye makeup effectively.

It removes makeup, but the scent is strong and it bothered me. I had to wash it off with Clinique soap.

not happy. slimy ....face dissent feel clean after. i washed with soap after use

Although this product has the backing of a well-known and trusted company, there is something that doesn't make sense. If you sell the product as fragrance-free then why is fragrance listed in the ingredient list?

I use to love this product and have used it for over 10 years. Unfortunately they have changed the ingredients and it caused an allergic reaction that caused my eyes to swell and cause dry skin. The allergic reaction resembled a chemical burn. When I finally narrowed down what was causing my reaction I saw serval other reviews with the same issue with the new ingredients. I also noticed the wipes dry out quicker and shred easily. Such a bummer.

I’ve used this product for 6+ years. They recently changed the material of the wipes to a plant-based compostable towelette. While I’m all for an environmentally friendly product, they feel rough when taking off eye make up and don’t hold enough product. I used to only ever need 1 wipe to take off my daily make up and now I have to use 2. Hard to say if this was a product redesign with the environment in mind or a ploy to get consumers to use more of their product resulting in more sales. Disappointed.

Wipes are generally such a WASTE! I deliberately purchased these because they're supposed to be compostable. The wipes I received have completely different ingredients and are not. I already opened them or would've sent them back. They'd just throw them out, so I might as well use them. That'd said, I like the convenience and they make my skin feel nice. I won't buy them again though, and risk receiving these again.

I don’t know if it’s permanent or what, but I have been ordering these forever and this time around I got them and on the package it says “New and better than ever” and wtf!? For starters, they smell NOTHING like they used to. Which is why I bought them in the first place. And secondly! They do NOT work as well! So instead of one makeup remover wipe, I have to use two to get it all off. I am SO incredibly disappointed >;(

Made my face burn — was hoping for more from neutrogena

These wipes are very smelly with a perfume scent that doesn't go away.  You have to wash your face to get the smell off. They take off makeup okay. Mascara and eye liner don't come off easily with these wipes. The sticky adhesive that closes the container only last through about 7 wipes and then it doesn't stay closed anymore and the wipes dry out. I do NOT recommend this product.

Burning and irritation

This product is fragrance heavy. It has a strong floral scent that triggered my allergies. It also did a mediocre job at removing makeup.

Great value

Moldy wipes!! Lot# 3180U4955AI've been using these for years and have automatic shipments. This particular pack was shipped back on 3/31 and I just got around to opening them, and to my surprise I found several of the wipes have black spots on them. Since these were shipped over a month ago I'm outside of my return window and out of luck. I used to like auto ship because I could keep items I use regularly stocked up, but after this experience I think I'll be canceling my other auto ship items, lest I have another problem like this in the future.

Sadly I can not use these. I have sensitive skin and these caused me to break out in a rash, also burned my eyes. And I ended up giving the second unopened pack to my neighbor and when she opened them (just days after they had arrived) they were completely dried out. What the heck?My experience was negative...skin rash, burning eyes, a completely dried out pack, but I'm giving them a 2 stars rating,,  because if you're not allergic to them, and you don't get a defective bone dry pack, I can see how these would be convenient.  It just didn't work for me!

These don’t do a very good job of taking eye makeup off. Also, why would anyone want to put something so heavily perfumed close to their eyes? The search is still on for something that will remove eye makeup  without tugging and pulling. This one isn’t it.

Great wipes, large size. The worst part of the wipes is that the package does NOT seal! You have to cut the package open, fold over the top part an put in a SEALABLE bag! This is incredibly stupid!!

I love the idea of these (aside from being bad for the environment). They smell good but feel like rubbing fiberglass on my face. AND they make me break out like crazy. I’m almost 40 and shouldn’t have acne-these give me acne. They don’t clean well at all. Great for a freshen up but NOT a replacement for washing your face or any part of your body. (Made my chest break out too!)Use a wash cloth and water if you must but skip these! Sorry!

I've used these for years and have always thought they worked really well. Recently they are 'new and improved' and I'm not a fan. They are not as moist and therefore struggle to remove the makeup as well. They also must be using a different formula because they smell different and made my eyes sting. I just want what I used to have, not this.

What did you guys do to this product????? Ugh!!!! This went from a five star product to a dud. The old formula and wipes were perfect as is. Its seems new the cloths are thinner and scratchy and the solution the wipes are soaked in no longer leaves light moisture. I'll be back when you fix this.

They have made these cloths smaller which makes them harder for me to use. The formula seems to be the same but I'm buying something else too so small. Why do companies have to keep shrinking products or increasing the price constantly? When you have a good product, leave it alone!

Still cleans your face but wipe is now very thin - no depth to it.But the worst is new packaging:  packaging tore almost immediately on opening for first time.  Had to tape with masking tape to keep the rest of wipes from drying out.Definitely will not ever buy again.

I've used these wipes for the past year or more. I waited for them to come back and now I'm realizing the new formula is not it for me. I used a wipe two nights in a row, and each morning I woke up the swollen/itchy eyes (eyelids), now my face is itchy. I wish they hadn't changed anything!

It doesn’t work well and burns my eyes even though I’m not wearing a lot of makeup

I do prefer this method of cleaning rather than washing my face with water and cleanser. HOWEVER, I use this product first, front and back, then I still have to use micellular cleaner to get off the left over make up. I usually have to go through 2-3 more cotton pads soaked in that for the cotton pads to come off clean. This product should work to remove make up completely the first time without the addition of a second product. It didn’t remove make up thoroughly as advertised.

I have always ordered these for almost daily use. The last order I got the wipes were so thin they were almost see-through. They rip and break when I rub them on my face. I’m not sure if this order was a fluke or if they’re being made thinner now. I hope it’s a fluke!

The scent was way too strong and just overpowering. It literally lingers which is unacceptable because it's not a pleasant smell. After the first time using one I realized, I have to wash my face right after using to get the smell off my face which defeats the purpose of "no rinse".Also, it's very drying for sensitive skin which again defeats the purpose of "no rinse".While it does remove make up very well, it's not much better than the other products I've tried that were less, uhm, "fragrant" and were far more gentle for sensitive skin.I would not recommend this to friends, family or fellow Amazon shoppers.

I have very sensitive skin and usually I get a different makeup wipe, but they weren’t available so I went with this one. Mistake. Feels scratchy compared to the other, left me feeling oily all over, had to practically scrub at my eyes to get eyeliner off which irritated my skin, and I developed blemishes/breakouts. Learned my lesson, sticking to what I know works.

I love makeup remover wipes, they are just so convenient during times when you don't have time to fully wash your face. However, these ones dry of my eyelids so bad even after one use! These are not good for sensitive skin and I will continue my search for sensitive skin makeup wipes.

I don't think I have terribly sensitive skin, but holy crap, these dried my face out so badly. I used these on Sunday, and it's now Thursday and my face is still so dry that it burns when I put lotion on. They're also pretty strongly scented. It's not a bad smell, just strong. They do remove waterproof eyeliner, but the way they dried my face out, yikes. I have never experienced this with another product.

I've used these for years, but the "New & Better Than Ever" formula burns my eyes and irritates my skin.  I need to find out what ingredient I'm reacting to so I can avoid it as I look for a new makeup remover product. So bummed.

They irritate my eyes and make me cry for hours after each use.They also don't do a good job of removing makeup. It takes a lot of rubbing to get even part of the makeup off.

I have used these for years. The last shipment has new and improved on it. They stink, they aren’t wet enough and they don’t clean my skin like they used to. The other type smelled wonderful and worked great. These are a big no.

The item description is incorrect.  The wipes are not fragrance free.  Sensitive skin beware.

Been using these for years and recent new and "improved" version is awful.  They're dry now and takes at least two to clean my makeup off where it used to easily only require one.  I'm 100% dissatisfied with the new version.

Not good for sensitive skin

These still seem to leave make up on my face so I would need to use another wipe. I don't wear alot of make up so one should be able to get it off.

Each wipe contains enough ‘solution’ to wipe both my face and neck and theSize of each piece is large enough to do the job. Leaves my face feeling fresh however I would also prefer to feel cleaned… it needs to be a little more of deep cleaner

idk if its just me, but after I use this, my eyes get very blurry and I get a headache. ??? can someone pls explain? also it dries out very fast because the seal doesn't stay on all the way.

I like the make up wipes, but they contain too much fragrance

Once package is opened sheets dry up quickly

This make up remover product really does not have enough moisture in the pad.  The pad is a little thicker than normal, but without having the moisture to take off the make up. need to wet the towelette..  I would not buy this again.

These cleansing wipes are gentle and do a good job of removing makeup. However, they do not remove mascara which has to be removed with another product, adding another step.

These wipes are better than any other soap or water in removing makeup.  However, after you open the package, then what?  There’s no way to close the package!  I had to put them in a ziplock bag.

I was expecting better from Neutrogena but like many other makeup wipes these burn my eyes pretty badly

This product always removed my mascara. Not any more

Made my skin red.

Too oily

I love this product usually… however this time it came with a hole in the main wrapped pack of 3. When i opened the night pack, it had 3 black thick hairs inside- stuck to the adhesive seal. Im so grossed out. Normally it’s been fine and a typical re-order. I don’t know what happened or how this could have happened. (No one in my home has black hair.)

The package does not close well and that makes it dry

These definitely work well, and even leave the skin a little bit moisturized after which was nice. Everything about them is fine except I could not handle the smell and I’m not normally chemically sensitive but something about it almost made me sick, but if you’re not the least bit sensitive to stuff, they probably won’t bother you at all but if you are, beware.

I've used these for years and in this last order they were very thin.  Not thick like the ones I buy at Wal-Mart.  I won't buy these online again.  They must be seconds or something.

They work but leave my skin texture super dry and I bit irritated unlike their night time towelettes.

One of the packs is kinda dry. The other one is okay.

I do not wear a lot of make up, but one of these is not enough to thoroughly clean my face. I always have to use two, which is just as bad for the environment, as if I bought one that is thicker and sturdier.

I know that all products don't work for me.  My skin is extremely sensitive but I thought that because Neutrogena made these wipes, that I could use them.  Wrong.  Definite burning next morning.  So I would say not for sensitive skin.

Taking eye make up off but not good for full face like some others. I’m breaking out more with these and seem extra dry so I’d say more harsh than others I’ve used. Does take off eye makeup well.

I used these makeup remover wipes for years without issue. I set up a subscription because I used them every night and loved them. But with the last order I received, they have really irritated my skin to where it’s caused a burning sensation. I switched to a different brand and haven’t had a problem. I’m not sure if they changed ingredients recently or what, but I won’t be going back to these.

These were sold as fragrance free wipes and they have fragrance listed on the package and in the product. I will not be buying these again.

I bought this to remove my eye makeup at the end of the day, and when I removed it after testing my new eye makeup I bought WITH this product, it really hurts.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it does remove the makeup fairly simply, it took me 6-7 swipes before it was fully removed. Though it feels like I'm wiping my eye with sandpaper, and my eyelid is really red. I wasn't even applying that much pressure.

I have a package from target and the ones I bought off Amazon. The packaging looks the exact same. The ones from Amazon smell strange like chemicals when compared to the ones bought at target. I wish i could get past the smell it leaves behind but it’s too strong especially when it’s something you put on your face.

Changed packaging and now the  sheets are almost dry. And I order 2 at a time.

Thought I was getting 3 packages of night calming, where I only got one package of night calming and 2 packages of daytime wipes. I should’ve read better, won’t buy again.

I have to use about 5 of these wipes to get makeup off. Kind of difficult to get mascara off.

I have used these wipes for years and trade off and on with other products.  The last batch of wipes were surprising as I don’t remember them causing “red eye” after using them for cleansing the eye area.  This just doesn’t work for me.  While I don’t wear eye makeup I do use various drops for Glaucoma and drops for dry eye (Systane original),  these drops need to be cleaned off the surrounding eye area twice a day.  My preferred cleanser is Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and I will stick with that for the time-being.

Listen, compared to the generic wipes, its extremely soft and removes makeup effectively. My only issue is that whatever chemical is on them is causing this strong fume/scent that burns my eyes. Theres no irritation on my skin as far as I can tell thankfully.But I dont know if maybe it's only the ones I received because I can't open my eyes until I wash my face or until I fan away the fumes after a couple of seconds. So unfortunately, back to generic brands for me. :(

I wear make up daily. For perspective, I wear a concealer, Mac foundation, eyeliner, brow liner, lip liner, lipstick and mascara. I am desperate to find a product that easily gets it all off.  These wipes do not but they are useful. First I use a wipe to remove my make up as instructed. That gets most of it off.  I then rinse the wipe with warm water, gently squeeze the water out and add a squirt of eye make up remover. That quickly gets all the liner and mascara off. I then rinse the wipe with warm water again, add a facial cleanser and wash my face. The wipe holds up well for all 3 uses. However, every step is necessary to get all the make up off.  I then apply my toner with a cotton ball.  Cotton ball is still white after application so I'm happy and will continue to use these wipes.

Labeled Fragrance Free-It is NOT Fragrance Free

Just took too long to be delivered

This improved version made quick work of removing even stubborn eye makeup in about half the time it took my old makeup remover.Unfortunately, it leaves behind an oily feeling residue, so if you're not in the habit of washing your face after removing your makeup, you will want to after using these.I hadn't had a breakout in years, but this product had me digging through my bathroom drawer hoping to find some expired acne treatment gel for my new blemishes. You may want to avoid using these if you are at all prone to breakouts.

First time I used this, I was shocked at how well it got rid of the makeup after using only two wipes. Then I noticed tenderness of the skin around my eyes and a slight "minty-burning" sensation in my eyes. Kinda like if you're in the kitchen while something spicy is cooking and you lean over the pot.I rinsed off good with water after that and the burning subsided after maybe about 15 minutes. But then I woke up the next morning to darkened areas on my temples that appeared to be burns. I am reluctant to use this again. I wish I saw the reviews that said it might not go well with sensitive skin.

It left a weird oily residue on my face that irritated it. When I use these, I usually have to rinse my face afterward - which defeats the purpose of a makeup wipe.

I love that it's easy to remove my makeup with a "sheet" instead of multiple cotton pads, etc. But, I feel like this dehydrates the surface layer of my skin. I do like that it is good for my skin which is sensitive. I also don't love to travel with something so heavy. I don't need that many sheets when I travel, and if you take them out they dry up. Haven't found a product I like better yet, but also don't overall love this one.

These are not fragrance free. I should’ve paid more attention to the actual picture. I would’ve recognized the packaging. They are still soft and remove what I need them to but darn it, ya know what I mean? I won’t be returning but I’ll definitely be a more attentive Amazon shopper. They may want to fix the product  description, though. Thanks!

If your looking for fragrance free as pictured,  this is not the one.  Tried to return with no luck.

Love these wipes but the package I received was not the fragrance free version.  Scents sometimes trigger headaches for me.  Signed up for automated fulfillments but might need to reconsider.  Still, these are so helpful for removing mascara and other facial products.

It cleaned my face but I'm not particularly liking the texture. I have super sensitive skin and this was a bit abrasive for me

These kind of remove makeup, it's difficult. They burn my skin and cause bad dryness. These are okay for maybe an overnight trip and you don't want to pack other face cleansing routine, but nightly use is a no go for me.

I wear makeup infrequently so I don't use makeup remover pads often. These get the job done and remove all my makeup, but when I use these to wipe away my mascara, my eyes burn for a full day after. I have to believe that is probably not good for me. Shea Moisture wipes don't do this to me so I will switch back to those.

It does work very well with taking makeup off, but when you go to take your eye makeup off, be careful not to get any in your eye. Keep your eye shut and wipe off with a tissue or toilet paper after.Opening my eyes after using the wipe to take off eyeliner somehow was enough to get some of the solution in my eye and it BURNS. My vision was blurry until I was able to get the solution out with toilet paper.Be careful.

Sadly this product did not work for me... very disappointed and I am getting mascara on my white towels.

Received the regular formula, NOT fragrance free

Received in good condition

These are not the fragrance-free kind! It even says in the ingredients "fragrance". They irritate my sensitive skin.

I was very disappointed to get the neutrogena wipes and find out they changed them to plant based. They are smaller now and don’t work very well on taking off my make up. They also tear more  easily. I know they’re supposed to be be better for us and the planet but if they aren’t working there’s no reason to buy them. I’ve been using neutrogena wipes for 15 years, they were the best product out there. Now I have to search for another better face wipe.

This says for mascara.  I bought it basically to remove my hypoallergenic mascara that is almost water-resistant.  But it makes my eyes burn so bad.  When I used in the morning my eyes burned all day until I cryed all my makeup off.  When I used at night I couldn't sleep because my eyes burned all night.  This is supposed to be hypoallergenic and for sensitive skin so I figured it would be gentle on the eyes too!  NOT even close!  I had to quit using it.  It made me miserable!!! 😖  Was a waste of money!!

Works as always Neutrogena has a good line of products. I use it to wash my face from the make up and every time I need to wash my dash & neck.

These are moist ,decent size , gentle and unscented however they are on the thin side meaning have to use more.

This cleans well and is not abrasive on the skin. Would give it 5 stars if it were cheaper.

I like the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, but there’s some room for improvement. Here are my thoughts:Pros:Effective Cleansing: These wipes do a good job of removing waterproof makeup, including stubborn mascara and long-lasting lip color.Ultra-Soft: The towelettes are ultra-soft and gentle on my skin, making the cleansing process pleasant without irritation.Alcohol-Free: I appreciate that these wipes are alcohol-free, which helps prevent my skin from drying out.Plant-Based: The plant-based composition is a nice touch, making them an eco-friendlier option.Convenient Packaging: The twin pack with 25 wipes each is convenient for both home use and travel.Cons:Moisture Level: The wipes could be more moist. Sometimes they feel a bit dry, requiring me to use more than one to thoroughly clean my face.Residue: Occasionally, they leave a slight residue on my skin, which requires rinsing afterward to ensure a completely clean feel.Overall, the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes are a solid choice for removing makeup, especially waterproof varieties. With a bit more moisture and less residue, they would be perfect.

I bought it to my trip to europy but when i got it it wasn't de individual bags that I saw is just big bag with wipes , so i would have like to get individual bags instead big bag , i would be more useful,  but ok

I’ve used these many years. My favorite always come back to them.

These really are great and so much easier to use than the liquid in the bottle.  You just pull out a wipe and it cleans all makeup from your face.  Works great on mascara and one wipe will take care of the entire face.

These are good but I always end up using at least 2 at a time so it goes fast. Wish it was a little more reasonably priced. But also I’m lazy, I can just go wash my face for a lot less. Which is what I’ll probably end up doing from now on. But it was a nice little luxury while it lasted.

as expected

ok

These makeup remover cloths are much softer than several others I have previously purchased.  They have a creamy feel yet are not greasy.  They are especially good for removing mascara.  They have an oval snap shut window that seems better at keeping the cloths from drying out.  Time will tell as I have just started using these cloths.  The fragrance is light & very clean smelling while in use but doesn’t linger afterward.  If they stay moist to the last cloth, I will purchase again.

Great make up remover but my face gets slightly irritated if I don't rinse extra well.

Ive been using these wipes for years now and they do the job wonderfully. However, I do have dry skin at times and there doesn't appear to be any lotion in them and they make my face feel worse. They are affordable and well designed.

Does their job well! Good for a quick face wash and removal of makeup

I have used this makeup removed for years. Good for sensitive skin / eyes

I love these wipes for removing your makeup without irritating skin!

Genuine product and works well for a great price

Definitely love the way this product works. And it does what it’s suppose. I suppose it could be thicker and a bit bigger

Always a solid choice for makeup removing on days when using a balm seems like one too many extra steps… I’m always looking for the best price on these and can confidently say Costco is the way (specifically when they have a sale)! Meanwhile, beware of Nordstrom Rack - it’s more expensive than Amazon

Nice cleaning cloths, a little thin, but good

Good product - arrived late

Product works well

Would purchase again

I use these to take off makeup, face, eyes and lips. They do a pretty good job. I still clean my face with my normal cleanser after using these, because I don't care for the feeling that there's residue left on my face or eyelids.

Review for Neutrogena makeup wipes. These are the best for makeup removal. They are good sized and thick. They do not stink like perfume like the Garnier ones. I use them for face makeup and eye makeup and they do not make your eyes sting or hurt or burn which alot of others do. I have tried alot of brands. This set is not a good deal since it dosent even include a 2 month supply if you use one a day. The Kroger ones are literally exactly the same wipe, even blue packaging and for a fraction of the cost, I would recommend that if you like these you try those.

I like the product. It removes my makeup very well. I like that it doesn’t burn my eyes.

I do like this product, but I’ve purchased an other brand that is just as good with sheets the size of  wash cloths.  I purchased this brand because my local store runs out of the makeup remover sheets so fast.  There is a good chance, however, that these cleansers are the same but on smaller sheets.

I've had adult onset acne for the past 3 years. My dermatologist suggested using a fresh washcloth on my face each time I washed it twice a day, 7 days a week.  No thanks.  So, I thought this would be a good alternative.I ordered 3 brands of facial cleaning wipes. This was the least expensive of the 3, and is tied in first place with the third brand I just started using last night. Brand number 2 that contains witch hazel is in the trash.It takes 3 of these  cleaning cloths to remove all my makeup.  I find the herbal scent a bit to loud and slightly offensive, BUT, I love the way you can fold these cloths and use them to clean sections of your face and neck, then unfold in layers to continually clean using a fresh, unfolded section.  This cloth does not slip and slide against itself like the other two brands do.  I love that about these cleaning face wipes.The other thing I love about these wipes is the fact they leave my skin feeling so clean and fresh without any buildup or residue left behind.I wish the packaging was more like that of brand number 3, which has a plastic snap in place lid that covers the slit the wet wipes reside underneath.  Towards the end of this package that sticky label was getting loose, and it was sometimes hard to get the sticky label over the open slit without any kinks or wrinkles in the package, letting air inside the package.I'd give a 5 Star, except for the strong herbal scent. Otherwise, these are the least expensive of the 3 brands I tried and are a solid number 1 when it comes to cleaning with no residue and being able to use each cloth in folded sections without each section slipping and sliding against the other section while trying to slide the folded wipe across the face.  Brands number 1 and number 2 are both almost impossible to use by folding and using clean, unused sections over different parts of my face/neck. I feel like I'm cleaning the cleaning cloth and not my face with both of the other 2 brands, but not this one. Yay!I would recommend these to anyone and will buy them again.

Dries too out too fast

Cleaning makeup of my face.

My daughter at fourteen is struggling with a bit of acne just as I did along with those pesky little bombs that pop up! She wanted these so badly to use to take her makeup off after dance or a day of wearing a little makeup. She loves them but gave them four stars due to them being a kitty scratchy. All in all good product.

They work well in removing makeup but, they definitely do not remove waterproof mascara as they claim.

i bought these for my friend and i use them and they burn my eyes idk

My favorite wipes

They could be a bit thicker and wetter

Takes waterproof mascara off very well.  I add one step & then use a wet washcloth to remove any residue.

I don't use these if I have on full make up, but in the mornings or at night when I have on minimal make up, they're really easy and refreshing to use.

It's a great product for what it does even takes the hair dye off my skin and sink top but it's for sure not fragrance free, not a bad smell but not fragrance free lol

Like that these feel soothing and clean my face pretty well. They leave a bit if greasyness behind and feel like I need to dry my face off with a towel after

Good product. The store we normally buy these for was out of stock. Amazon price was more than double but we purchased them anyway because we ran out of our supply at home

All these facial wipes get pricey, but I don't like washing my face at night, so this is my answer for now.  I've tried different types and I think this is my favorite for now.  Target makes a nice thick wipe, but it smells horrible.  This wipe is scented, but not overpowering.  Not sure why they feel the need to scent them at all since preference of scents is so subjective and these are going right under your nose, but most companies do.  These are not as thin as some others, so that's nice.  It's hard to get the first one or two out.  They don't irritate my face at all, and my skin is left soft without any tightness or greasiness.

After the product I used for twenty years was discontinued, I was forced to find a new makeup remover. I tried some other liquid and creme removers and didn't like them at all. I found these to try. The wipes really do remove my eye makeup, eye shadow, liner and mascara and pressed powder very well and it only takes one wipe. It leaves just a slight greasy feeling - but not bad at all, it more feels like moisturizer. My face feels fresh afterwards. I tend to have very sensitive  skin and has rosacea. I take medicine for that and these wipes do not cause a flair up for me. I kind of wish they came in a different type of package, but I bet the package they come in is cost effective, so it's acceptable. I'm pretty happy with these after 2 weeks of use, so I may have found my new makeup remover.

convenient for cleansing, offering gentle Facial Towelettes. However,  I find the wipes a bit too thin, occasionally tearing during use. The fragrance-free aspect is appreciated, yet the thinness might not meet everyone's preference. Despite the potential for tearing, these wipes effectively remove makeup, providing a cleansing solution for those who prioritize fragrance-free options, though improvements in durability could enhance the overall user experience.

They remove makeup well, and are reasonably priced, probably because they need to be put in a plastic container, not included, in order to avoid drying out.  Nonabrasive, and I can cream my face directly after using them.

I thought they were individual wrapped.  Hard to keep fresh when the package is open.  Still function as they should.  Read the discription.

Product as described

Easily removes eye makeup without tugging and burning. Have not tried it on foundation. Does a good job.

These wipes have proven to do a good job for removing my makeup. My face feels replenished and clean. These pads are part of my regimen every night.One thing that I took a star away for is the slight burn around my eyes after I clean off my false eyelashes with soap and water. I have to use another product to remove the lashes or use this first before washing my face. It’s weird but through trial and error, that’s how it is for me.Despite that, I will continue to use these wipes. The convenience and cleanliness as a result is unmistakable.

Could be a little stronger.but will do.

Ive been using these make up remover wipes for years! This one and the calming night wipes. Have tried other brands, this one removes make up easily and smells great! Skin feels clean and soft after use.

I thought these were individually wrapped, but they still did their job. They are sensitive on the skin and get makeup off easily.

i don’t even have to do my skin care at this point my skin comes out so soft and clean!

I love these wipes because one sheet can completely remove a full face of makeup. I love how it makes my face feel moisturized and not dry.

Only make-up remover clothes I'll use in my face 💯💯💯5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Removed the most stubborn mascara and never leaves my skin dry

These are a staple in our home. I love that they come in a twin pack to be shared. I highly recommend them!

Always a “yes” to these wipes. They remove all of my makeup including mascara without vigorous scrubbing. Just wish the price was better.

If you’re familiar with these wipes, then you have nothing to worry about. If you’re not familiar, they work great. I like to use these wipes, specifically when taking off my eyelash glue that nearly impossible to take off without a quality product.

I love these wipes! Either starting my morning or after being outside .makes my face feel clean and fresh.

I’ve been using this product for 15 years and complete believe it to be excellent value for the money.

Useful and not rough on the skin. Ordered again.

This is the best stuff works great

These are classic and helpful as always

These are the best makeup remover wipes ever! I have tried other brands and they do not live up to these!The best thing is that you can tear them if you only need half! Excellent product!

I have used these for years and find them very gentle on my eyelids and lashes and also on my skin would highly recommend them

Gets all the make up cleared and does not irritate the skin

Love it! The best makeup remover wipes!Removes waterproof makeup!

I was at a hotel that had these wipes as one of the complimentary toiletries. I used one and liked it so much that I ordered a bunch.  The wipes remove even waterproof makeup really well and don't irritate my eyes. I like the portability too. Take a couple camping, 4-wheeling, etc. for face washing.

It worked, a little pricey compared to baby wipes.

Works great feels good

These will be great when on the go, they clean off my makeup with ease, including my mascara.

Don’t know what I’d do without these babies! They work extremely well and I make sure I am always stocked up. I even gift them 🤷🏽‍♀️

Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes remain a popular go-to for convenience and efficiency.

Liked this product

It is convenient and works well

Unlike their individually-packaged counterparts, these Wipes do stay wet.  ( Not an everyday makeup wearer, I have a package of these I initially opened in 4/23, that are still working).  And they do work fairly well, though it sometimes seems like I can never totally get off my mascara.  My face feels fresh after with no irritation.

I initially bought these to use after my son's wedding--I rarely use makeup, and definitely needed waterproof mascara for a wedding!  To my surprise, not only did they gently and easily remove makeup, but they left my skin feeling soft rather than stripped.  I've since incorporated them into my daily routine.

I love these makeup removers. They work fine. I think they moisturize as they remove the makeup. Nonetheless, I still recommend washing your face and using a facial moisturizer after using these.

Reliable 100%

Fabolous took the make up up like a champ. I’ll buy again.

Convenient for use, removes all types of makeup without hassle. It's actually as easy as shown on advertisements.

A

I love how effective the wipes are in getting rid of even the thickest layer of makeup off of your skin. I bought these because I wore makeup for a friend's wedding - I generally don't wear makeup - and after it was over I used these wipes to get it off. Worked like a charm and I even had the fellow bridesmaids ask if they could use some to get their makeup off. Definitely a good product to get!

I have purchased these from different places and I find that Amazon usually has the best prices.

Great for removing makeup and very gentle on the face

Doesn’t great job getting your make up off quickly so you can get more ZZZ’s!! They are also very soft on sensitive skin. Love the Neutrogena wipes!

Those whom have girls that are in dance cheer band softball volleyball ball. Those hard eye black chalk or a makeup have now chance with these wipes.!

These work well for when makeup needs removal without water

These makeup cloths barely remove my face makeup that other brands easily remove. It also doesn’t remove much of my eye makeup without have to scrub at it, which is horrible for your eyelids, eyelashes, and under eyes! And it’s also caused irritation on my eye area, causing stinging and redness. From such a well-known and established brand, I expected a better level of makeup removal. I bought a pack of 120, have used 5 of them, and do not plan on ever using the rest. Total waste of money.

I have been using Neutrogena makeup remover wipes for years now., normally purchased from Costco. This particular product does not work well for me at all. I don't know if it's a Fragrance-free thing but it's just not effective. I wake up with eyeliner residue, and even after showering and using the wipes it doesn't completely come off. Nothing is different about my makeup routine.

My eyes burned, turned bright red, and we're swollen for days.

I ordered this product because I have used it for years.  When this arrived, i realized I had accidentally ordered it in "fragrance-free."  I was bummed but decided to keep it anyway.  After 5 days of breaking out in facial hives and not knowing why, I finally figured out it was due to the fragrance-free makeup wipes.  I looked at the ingredients and compared them to my regular Neutrogena makeup wipes.  Sure enough, there are 7 ADDITIONAL ingredients in the fragrance-free wipes than in the regular wipes.  Who knew that something claiming to be fragrance free would cause this type of allergic reaction?!

I was on vacation with a friend and she saw me pull the fragrance free wipes out of my toiletry bag and warned me that they are horrible . She was right, the fragrance free version do no remove makeup very well at all. I had to use 2-3 wipes and was still getting mascara off. The wipes are rather dry compared to the regular neutrogena wipes. On a positive they do not irritate your skin or cause breakouts; just don't expect to remove your makeup efficiently. I ended up just throwing these out.

I will start by saying I do have oily/sensitive skin & I realize everyone has a different experience but this made my skin feel disgusting. It feels like wiping your face with the napkin used to soak up cafeteria pizza grease. I break out every time I use one. If you have dry skin, I can see how this product might be okay but the residue is just not something I can tolerate.

I only write positive reviews - love to share the good, however, I had to write this review as the product so irritated & burned my eyes for 2 days!  I so wish that the company reassess the ingredients making it organic!

Even though it says these are fragrance free they leave a coating of something slightly oily on the skin so you will need to fully wash with soap and water after you use these. And even though I tried to wash off whatever it was my eyes watered all night long from the residue. Disappointing.

These are not good! They are suppose to be for sensitive skin but are terrible! Threw in garbage

What a terrible product. After using these make up wipes I had a ton of bumps all over my face!  It took days to clear up. This will clog your pores and make things worse. Save your money try molecular water wipes.

These wipes claim to be “fragrance free,” but they have a very pungent chemical scent that burns my nostrils. Not good for use shortly before needing to wear a face mask, as the mask traps and intensifies the chemical odor.

I would have given this product a zero if I could. I wish I had read the reviews. This item has a horrible smell and it stays for a while. I used it twice and I never will again. I have really like Neutrogena products in the past but this is horrible. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

When I opened these for the first time, I was surprised to find that the wipes were dried out. It's past the return window so I'm out $11.

I usually use the equate brand wipes because you get twice as much for half the price but I figured I’d splurge on neutrogena. These wipes aren’t moist enough, the wipes themselves are rough on your skin. To top it all off, they caused me to break out in hives and I had burns on my face for days.

I bought a 4 pack of the neutrogena face wipes .....but they are very very old they smell musty as he'll I have the pkgs...I need to return these if I can do not order these...their horrible...

This batch of Neutrogena facial cleansers that I bought has evidently been kept in a really hot warehouse because they have turned sour & I’ve had to throw them away. They stink really bad.

These showed up wet! The packaging was wet from the inside, like the product leaked or something.  Not very happy about this.

Smells AWFUL and very rough on my skin. Ended up with tiny cuts all over my face, neck and shoulders, as did 3 friends who tried them (all with different skin types) I'll stick to my Wal-Mart brand face wipes.

i recommend literally anything but this they are so rough and don’t remove waterproof mascara

When these wipes are actually wet they are great and take the makeup off but these wipes are so dry it does absolutely nothing. This is the second time I got stuck buying a pack of dry wipes.

It may be fragrance free but definitely not stank free.

This product has a musty smell that makes me think it’s expired. There’s no expiration date on the package. If that’s not the problem, the smell is awful.

The generic ones are not dry when you take one out of the package like these are.Very disappointed.

I ordered these and they are NOT FRAGRANCE FREE!!!!! I am allergic to fragrance and used these on my EYES! NOT COOL!

Nice product .. best on the market

It leaves an uncomfortable oily residue on the skin. That does not work for me.

BURNS SENSITIVE SKIN AND TURNS IT BEAT RED. Also drys out the skin horribly.

A bit to chemically for me

The wipes were very dry & had very little make-up remover on them.  You can't remove your make-up without makeup remover...

I love them when I buy them at Walmart,  so moist.  The ones I got online were not moist at all.☹

These do not work as good as the original ones. They are pretty dry upon opening and do not remove makeup well as a result.

It is dray

Cloths were dry when i opened them.

For travel or whoever.

they were not wet as if you got them in the store

I have used this product for years with good results BEFORE this new formulation. This new version is horrible. The paper is rough and it doesn't remove the makeup. It smells putrid, too. They say "go woke, go broke" and Neutrogenia is about to learn what this means.

False adveryising and strong smell. Product not fragrance free as advertised. Terrible strong smell...ingredient actually listed as "Fragrance".

These wipes leave your face with a film on it.  If you're OCD about your skin being clean and feeling clean, these are not the wipes for you.

I tried these on a full face of makeup that included:- foundation- blush- eyeliner above the lid- eye shadow- translucent setting powder- lip liner- lipstick- washable (NOT waterproof) mascara.After using three towelettes, a lot of makeup was left behind on my face. It was particularly difficult to clean around my eyes and the solution on the towelette started to make my eyes burn even though they were closed when using them. The package says it removes makeup including waterproof mascara in seconds. I did not find either of those statements to be true.Eventually I gave up and washed my face with soap and water. I then used a fourth towelette to see if any makeup was left behind, and except for one smudge near my eye that came off, the towelette remained white.I would definitely not buy these for me because too many towelettes are needed and I found them irritating.

The fragrance-free wipes gave me a horrible face burn. YES, they remove makeup, but these cause horrible hives and rashes for me. I will never use these again in my life. Not even for lips or eyes, as they got burned as well from these

This is not the real Neutrogena make-up  remover,  the wipes are so dry i have to wet it every time i am taking of my makeup

I compared the product I received to a friend (who purchased her makeup removal wipes at a trusted retail store, not online) and they didn't feel or smell the same. These wipes pull out my lashes and leave a lot of left over makeup residue. THESE ARE NOT LEGIT NEUTROGENA WIPES. They can't be. I've never felt them so harsh any other time I've bought them at the store.

Does not clean well and rough on skin. I was excited about getting a good deal for these on prime day but was sadly mistaken when I used them the first time…:( I didn’t think there would be such a dramatic difference between the nuetragena makeup wipes with the blue label to the ones with the white label! Do not sacrifice quality for money on this product, these white label nuetragena makeup wipes are trash.

They don't remove waterproof makeup easily. Best result is to do it in the shower after running hot to warm water over your face. My eyelashes started to fall out from wiping my mascara off without doing it in the shower. Sometimes I use non waterproof mascara and it's still difficult wiping off.

last time it wasn't fragrant free en though that's what I ordered.  the fragrant wipes gives me bad headaches

The texture of these facial wipes is rough. It causes my skin to burn when I use them to wipe my makeup off. I am so disappointed because my teenage daughter and I had been waiting to try this particular brand of makeup wipes and had high expectations because of so many great reviews and it being a reputable brand name. Unfortunately, my daughter and I ,both, are experiencing pretty substantial breakouts from these wipes! Neither of of had an issue with breakouts prior to using these makeup wipes and this is the only thing that was added or changed in our beauty regimen. The only breakouts that would occur were the FEW pimples around the chin area around period time from hormonal changes. Now, we have our faces peppered in pimples!!! This product is supposed to  be comedogenicic, correct? Perhaps I am mistaken but regardless, this is a huge disappointment. We will definitely be trying other brands of makeup wipes out. On top of this issue, there's the issue with having to use 4-5 wipes to clean off "natural look" makeup. This is unheard of!

Really messy and wet

These wipes have a strong unpleasant chemical smell.  Not at all what I was expecting.  I regret buying the two pack.  I usually use the Simple brand fragrance free, which IS fragrance free.  The most recent pack of Simple wipes had a new texture to the cloth that wasn't an improvement, so I decided to try something else.  These Neutrogena wipes are effective and the texture is soft on the skin, but I don't know if I can stand using them because of the smell.

There is nothing particularly egregious about this product. My gripe is with this type of product in general. Makeup remover wipes are incredibly abrasive and bad for your skin due to the tugging motion. What is more, they are bad for the environment and ineffective. I understand that the appeal is the convenience but if you really want supple and wonderful skin, substitute remover wipes for cleansing balms or oils instead. If you really must use something that requires tugging, use bio cellar water. Anything is superior to wipes

Please do your skin a favor and do not get these. I bought them for a trip to Europe, so I wouldn’t have to worry about bringing a liquid eye makeup remover. They did their job when it comes to removing makeup, but my god, my skin has never been worse. I broke out in places I never have before and they are stubborn zits.Plus, when I got to about halfway through my second package, I saw a mold spot on one of the wipes. I was horrified and threw them away immediately. Just...go for something else. Your skin will thank you.

These makeup wipes have had a strange mildewy odor the last few times I’ve purchased them. Additionally, they are not moist enough so I find myself dragging them on my skin even to just remove the light makeup I sometimes wear. Plan to look for a different brand of makeup wipes; very disappointed in Neutrogena for lowering the quality of what used to be the best makeup remover wipes.

Unfortunately these wipes are *not* for sensitive skin as they burn after using, especially around the eyes. They don't work that well to remove makeup either and are quite thin compared to others such as Ponds. Do not recommend.

Neutrogena  Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Wipes, Fragrance Free, 25 Count, 2 Packs
The Fragrance Free Wipes are drier than the original Neutrogena Wipes. I first purchased these at a drug  store and thought they were dried out from sitting on the shelf too long. I ordered these here on Amazon and found the same issue with this purchase. They remove the make-up, but I have to use two of them instead of using one, as I do with the original Neutrogena Wipes.

These might work ,but, they leave my eyes burning and feeling like something is in them.

It is not cruelty free and many animals suffer severely in experiments!  Read PETA and find the animals that are in horror labs due to cosmetics and skin care!

Doesn’t feel as soft and smooth as the store bought ones. Felt a bit scratchy and rough on my face. May feel better if they are ran under water first... but, I shouldn’t have to do that with “pre-moistened towelettes”.Also, left my face feeling oily and not really clean..

This has a strong smell and I felt it irritated my skin. Will be trashing this.UPDATE:  I just looked at this package and confirmed that I did order "fragrance free".  I thought I just made a mistake with the purchase and got the original so why the smell?????

I experienced a lot of burning and peeling skin, especially on my eye lids!

It’s not very comfortable to use a new one in the morning, so I won’t repurchase it next time.

I asked for fragrance free ones , but got the regular ones ! I have sensitive skin !

Liked them but the packet dried out way too quickly.

These work ok, but not as well as the ones I have purchased at the store, and they have an u pleasant smell.

Do not recommend. Both my daughter and I have used these and are very sensitive to them

Dried out.

Too dry and my skin burns from it

I like and use many Neutrogena products. These were not good. Not moist enough to clean one's face. If a product doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to, it's essentially worthless.

Dries out even when package is pressed closed after opening.

Not nearly as good as the wipes.  But all you can find now are the crappy towelettes.

smelled moldy and burned my eyes, unliken usual

I used to use this product on a regular basis with no problem. But something seems to have changed.  The wipe itself is harsher and doesn't feel soft on my skin.  The wipes are also are much drier-- I end up adding a little water to them just to make them less irritating.  I've now stopped using them because they were irritating my eyelid area-- leaving it red and feeling like I had a brush-burn. It hurt to just touch the area.  This is disappointing-- don't know if it's me or the product, but after years of using it, I have stopped.

The wipes smell weird, like chemicals and I found that when I used them they weren't less efficiently and gave me more acne, but whenever I sleep with my makeup on my acne is not as bad

Easy removal, eyes can sting if I rub too hard but still takes off everything (as far as I can see)

Unfortunately this product did not agree with my skin. It created a rash my face. I had to discontinue use. 😌

Depending on what you put on AFTER you use these, you might actually ruin your skin. I used these for YEARS - even around my eyes - and had no problem. The issue came when I changed my moisturizer. As far as I can tell, if you use a retinol based moisturizer (over the counter) after using these remover pads, you’ll tear up your lovely skin around the eyes. And it buuuuurns. I even tried switching to retinol free but the moisturizer I used had a chemical SPF in it and it burned even worse. My fix was twofold: 1) only use squalane oil after removing eye makeup or 2) use regular bar soap to remove the rest of my eye makeup.I wish I knew exactly what was going on but I felt I should mention it since the package literally says ‘gentle, even for eyes’. And it is…but there’s a rather large caveat and it’s unfair not to tell folks what that caveat is.

Ok, I love Their products. Great for sensitive skin to clean at the end of the day. My complaint is the container doesn’t quite seal back so the wipes dry out before I could use them all. Maybe I can put the pouch in a ziplock so they stay moist.

This is too oily for my skin and made me break out. I prefer the Wal-Mart brand because it is just the right amount of cleanser and moisture for me. I do have oily skin so it may work fine for someone with dry skin.

It's much easier to just use olive oil on a cotton pad way cheaper and works just as well with no skin irritation

I’m glad it helps with my sensitive skin, but my mascara still doesn’t fully come off. So that part is a bummer.

They work, however, the darn tab keeps ripping in a way that doesn’t allow me to close the pack, which means all the wipes keep drying out. Wish I could say it was only once or because I wasn’t being careful. I’d prefer if there was a container and these were just refills. Or is there one somewhere that I missed? Too expensive to have them dry out constantly.

These WORK very well. I like them but the packaging could be better... especially for what you pay for them. The sticker deal does not stay shut after a couple uses and I have to make sure I sandwich the packages down so they don’t dry out.

They have a smell to them but they work great

These facial wipes didn't seem fresh to me, like they'd been stored in a warehouse for too long without climate control maybe. Didn't really smell very good and made my face break out.

Wasn't a fan. I usually buy the regular wipes but decided to try these because they were on sale. A little on the dry side.

I will probably buy more but these are kind of pricey for day to day use.  They work ok and I will probably get more for when they are really necessary but they cost too much to use unless really necessary.

It gets the makeup off after a few wipes but I don’t like the nasty oily residue it leaves on my face. Even after washing my face, it still feels weird

They did not smell as fresh as the ones I have purchase previously.

The wipes were a little on the drier end when I received them, they still did the job though, just added a touch of oil on them when removing eye make up.

They were a bit dry.

Although it did remove makeup, the cloths were extremely rough on my skin. It almost felt like a physical exfoliator!!! Won’t be purchasing again.

Towelettes are quite dry. Need 2 in order to remove  mascara.

Don't deep clean. Leave a coating.

Super super oily product and doesn’t remove my make up

difficult to remove from package  cvs product better plus it snapped close keeping product moist longer

Works OK but feels rough on eyes/sensitive skin.

Not good for face cleaning.

Not really impressed - seem on the dry side .

Smaller package than what I get at the store

These state fragrance free but they are not

Not a bad towelette not just not my preferred.  I usually use Burt's Bees sensitive and will go back to that.  We keep facial towelettes around the house for when we want a quick face wash (both myself and my two daughters) and we bring them on camping trips for face cleaning and hand cleaning.  I don't wear makeup regularly and when I do it is not a lot, a little liner, shaow in the crase, a little mascara, and powder.  This towelette had no problem with any of my makeup.  I have rosacea.  This towelette is rough, but it did not seem bother my skin and the roughness helped get my face cleaner.  Even on days I did not wear makeup I used these as a refresher to feel cleaner and was surprised by just the dirt this towelette removed.  I was intrigued by these because of the claim that they require no rinsing afterwards, I have heard that before.  I cannot say that about these towelettes, they felt like they left a residue on my skin.  That residue feeling felt like it went away once my skin was dry, but all that means is that the residue dried but it was still on my skin.  I did not feel like I wantd to put my moisturizer on over that.  I have not found a towelette yet that is truly no-rinse.  If I couldn't find my preferred brand I hate to say these would not be my next choice, I'd probably go with Say Yes before these, so these Neutrogena might make my third in line.

These are okay and certainly convenient.  They worked very on general face makeup like foundation and powder but I didn't find that they worked on my eyeshadow that well, plus the scent irritated my eyes a bit.Now, what you should know about me is that I'm an old lady who doesn't wear a lot of makeup, and I have super sensitive dry skin.  It's sensitive enough, in fact, that I found the cloths slightly abrasive.  But again, I'm a snowflake.SUMMARY--the cloths were slightly rough on my super-sentive, snowflake-older-mom skin.--cleaned off foundation and powder very well--did not get off all of my eyeshadow and I didn't like using the cloths around my eyes--left a residue feel--very convenientPersonally Neutrogena's
Hydro Boost Hydrating Gel Cleanser
works better for me.

I hate saying this but I was completely disappointed..I  kept trying thinking it was something else I was wearing but even with a clean face .I wipes and left a dirty greasy feeling..sad 😥 what happened?

These wipes left my face oily and didn’t even take off all my makeup and I wear very minimal makeup… a baby wipe cleaned way better than these

Great for travel. No need for water as these moist towelettes are perfect. Arrived as promised. Great quality & great price. No perfume smells. Does not irritate skin. Refreshing way to remove makeup.

The Neutrogena Cleansing Fragrance-Free Makeup Remover Face Wipes are a staple in my makeup removal routine, especially for removing waterproof makeup. As a false eyelash wearer, these towelettes are my go-to choice due to their oil-free formula that effectively removes makeup without damaging my lashes. The convenience of quickly wiping the day off with these plant-based fiber towelettes makes them an essential part of my beauty regimen. Their alcohol-free and unscented properties ensure a gentle yet thorough cleansing experience. Overall, these Neutrogena makeup remover wipes are a reliable solution for effortlessly removing makeup, including waterproof products, while being gentle on the skin and lashes.

Perfect size. Does the job and smells great, and very refreshing plus soft on your skin.I have had other that were hard to remove but not these. Just open and take out. Easy.

These are the best wipes I’ve found! They’re soft and completely remove makeup without scrubbing. There’s a soft fragrance that doesn’t linger. I just rinse with water and apply moisturizer. The package is small enough to easily to toss in my bag for overnight trips.

I ordered these wipes through Amazon because I didn’t have time to go to the store. They work well and smell nice. You can find similar products for a better price elsewhere.

Great job removing all make up! No issues with skin irritation. So quick to grap and wipe clean

These are gentle but very effective in removing even waterproof makeup. I have been using them for years.

Women and their makeup for a vital part of their existence and my daughter needs to have these wipes on hand to keep her skin clean and fresh. Look like a pretty good product, I might get some just for general facial man maintenance. Neutrogena is a good product, sold and consistent.

I have used these wipes for years and I love them! They are not greasy and do not break me out. The wipescare gentle and do not irritate my eyes. They have removed eyelash glue and even waterproof mascara. Buy more than 1 especially when on sale!

I love these wipes but I am quite sensitive to smells, so happy I found these fragrance free wipes.  They are large enough that you o ly need to use 1 to throughly clean off all my makeup from the day and don’t dry out my skin after using, in fact my skin feels quite soft after using.

I liked that it’s for sensitive skin.  Disliked the size, should be bigger to take makeup off.

Took on international travel and use at home for messy poop. I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate me.

I use these almost every night before bed.If I had a lot of makeup on that day I would use 2 wipes.I trust Neutrogena for my skin care and would recommend these.I order them here and always get a few of the double packs in unscented.(by Sue)

Would order again

Love the results but they’re too expensive

Enjoying convenience & they work nicely!!😃😃😃

This is not unscented, even though it is supposed to be.

I like these wipes a lot. They take off make-up very well and I rarely need more than one wipe. Something to keep mind:1. The wipes are thin. They are not those thicker boys.2. These do have a smell. It has slightly bothered and made my eyes water but I have noticed no issues with my skin.Overall, I will order more of these. I do recommend them.

Works well for removing all my makeup but not my stay put waterproof mascara. So that part sucks. But other then that it works well and nice to travel with.

They’re a little rough/scratchy. I only wear makeup around my eyes and eyebrows, so I don’t need a lot of roughness to remove foundation or anything. I’ve used other makeup wipes, even exfoliating ones, and nothing was as scratchy as these.The eyes are the most sensitive area of skin, so I try not to use these too generously around that area. Not too pleased.They don’t work super well for a certain mascara I use, either.I’ve had better brands, but will probably buy these again, because they’re reasonably priced and I can find them just about anywhere.

Good price for a two pack. The wipes are good but justt shy of a 5-star review. Almost no scent (a plus!), super soft and thick. I wear a full face of makeup and can take it off with one wipe. Tough mascara needs a bit of a patience (and sometimes a second wipe) to remove. Resealable packaging isn’t that resealable so having a holder for wipes helps keep them moist.  Wipes leave a very light moisturizer and don’t dry out your skin.

I love the quality and size of the cloths.  They are perfect, durable and tough.  The makeup remover solution is a little burning to my skin and i don't consider my skin to be sensitive.  I still use it.  It doesn't burn my eyes at all, just my skin a little.  I still love it.

These wipes remove most of my makeup fairly well. I do have to wash my face afterward with a cotton washcloth and face-wash to get the makeup residue100% off. However, I've saved my white washcloths from makeup stains by using these.The wipes for sensetive skin do not cause any irritation.

Happy with these cleansing wipes - they're not stinky with fragrance, and don't leave behind a "greasy" feeling like a lot of them. Plus, they seem to clean pretty well and haven't made me break out - so far so good. Yay!

These work well, and they do take makeup off. They're slightly bigger than they need to be, and I don't feel especially clean afterwards--like the wipes take the makeup off, but I still feel like I need to wash my face afterwards. My skin hasn't been especially great! But they're a good price and are good for traveling especially. Easy to take makeup off quickly and easily before bed.

These cleansers are great. Lather is perfect. My face feels amazingly clean after using.

doesn't remove waterproof mascara but does a good job on makeup.  I still wash my face afterwords but feel like this does a decent job.  I have super sensitive skin so I always wash my face twice to make sure all of the makeup is removed.  These do a really good job at getting most of it.

I do love these wipes. They are great at removing makeup and leaving my face feeling clean. I only wish the closure was tighter on the package because it is easy for the flap to stay open causing the towels to dry out.

I have sensitive skin.  These remove the make up fine and easy to travel with.  Sometimes wont even rinse after make up removal my only complaint is they are a bit scratchy for my taste

Loved that they cause no irritation.  Good for removing general makeup but had to wash waterproof mascara off as these only took a little off.Would still recommend for people with sensitive skin.

These are great. They don't always remove 100% of my makeup, but they do better than anything else I've ever used without irritating my eyes or breaking out my skin. I recommend if you're looking for a makeup remover that works without irritation.

They remove make up well,  I believe the value of the product is quite good in relation to the price.  My only objection to this product is it is a bit too oily

The only reason I’m giving it a 4 is sometimes after it feels like it leaves a little cleanser on your face so you need to rinse after

They take off makeup well, but they dry out quick and they are too rough (I always close them back up and I put them in a plastic container for makeup wipes.)

Overall this is a great product. My only complaint is that for just eye and lip makeup it is pretty wet

I like that they remove makeup EASILY, even waterproof mascara. Each gentle, soft, moist towelette is ideal for sensitive skin & contact lens wearers.

Does a good job but leaves a residue and makeup behind. Still need a wash cloth and water.

I love this so much

Always good. Not as good as Aveeno but good. These will always be my number two and I will continue using.

Works great. Leaves behind a film. So I always use warm water and wash cloth to wipe afterwards.

Wipes work, sometimes have to use two.

Stated individual packsNot two big packs

Removes makeup. What else is there to say? No irritation, no stupid fragrance - sensitive skin approved. One wipe gets the job done 90% of the time. Can't say that for other makeup removing wipes, now, can you? Nope.

Good but hurts eyes

They work really well, but are a bit harsh on the skin

Product came in properly?

no manufacture nor expiry date. worrying. delivery fast though

Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Wipes are a fast easy way to remove makeup. I've been using them this summer to clean the daily sweat and dirt off my face when not wearing makeup.  I have sensitive skin with some rosacea and these don't irritate my skin.  They are fragrance free which I prefer.  Most days I don't wear much makeup, if any at all. On those days, I cut the wipes in half.  My face does need the entire wipe to get clean and makes them last longer.  On days when I wear full makeup, I need the use of an entire wipe.I've used different face wipe brands over the years. I like to always have a pack at home for days when I don't feel like washing my face with soap and water.  Some leave a residue feeling after I've used them.  These didn't leave that feeling. They didn't irritate my rosacea either. I have read that face wipes don't remove all make up and dirt. That they just move the makeup and dirt around your face.  I'm not sure if that's true. I've only felt the need to wash my face after using the cleansing wipes if I wore a lot of make up and have difficulty removing it (such as mascara).

Honestly, I have looked for great makeup cleaners & removers that do work very well, but I haven't actually found one that absolute works for my family. While I have used a lot of good concealer that do work like cold creams from Clearasil & Olay. But what to do when you are trying to clean your face from getting off that makeup that clean actually cause blackheads & blemishes. So, when I had heard about cleaning wipes that remove makeup from Neutrogena, I was very skeptical to find out if they do actually work for my mother. Honestly, when I did get these makeup cloths, I honestly was surprised with the results. Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Cloths do a very good job at removing makeup that can actually be very hard to get off of your face. I was very surprised at how well it works at removing the most stubborn makeup from mascaras & skin cream that not even the best soap on the market can actually claim they can get off. So for men & women that do want a great makeup remover, I absolutely suggest you do get these cleaning cloths from Neutrogena.Price: C+Convenience & Comfort: BOverall: B 1/2-

These are very handy for travel and for those occasional late nights when you just don't want to bother with the facial scrubs, cleansing lotions, rinsing, and on and on. My only concern is that the seal will lose it's tackiness and the towelettes will dry out before I finish using them,. I have never had that not happen, and I will update this review when I finally do get to the end of these and see if that happens.Until then, I will happily tote them on trips where I find them to be invaluable.This does a very good job of whisking my face clean. The solution seems to be gentle enough for me - it did not irritate my eyes one bit -  and my face looks fresh and clean after using one. My only complaint - and the reason for 4 stars - is the texture of the towelette. It's somewhat rough for my super-sensitive skin. Most pre-moistened towelettes that I've used are much softer. Maybe this cleans a little more vigorously because of the rough texture, but my skin was pretty red after using it.Other than that, I like these towelettes quite a lot.

These are good and the only ones my 95 year old Mother-n-aw has used most of her life!!

Great price and arrived quick.

These are not only good for removing eye mascara!  They remove paint from your fingers, and clean up is o you never knew you had paint.  I have found them wonderful to keep in the car for any clean ups!  Love them!

Neutrogena cleans your face without drying it out! I highly recommend using this brand!

Removes makeup with ease, doesn’t smell weird. Wipes are not rough on face, easy to store and use for travel.

I use these every day to take makeup off.  They’re great

Either traveling or at home.Can't go wrong with Neutrogena cleansing wipes. Removed heavy foundation and eye makeup.It's my go-to remover and always travel with it.

Removes make up well and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.

These were perfect for our long travels.  We spent 30 hours traveling on airplanes/layovers.  They were very refreshing and helped cool me down, while cleaning my face very well.  Love using them!

I love these to take ALL my makeup off, they work great and my skin is soft afterwards.

This Neutrogena product is great for sensitive skin and the wipe material is not abrasive. Been using this product for many years with great results.

Smells great cleans with ease and very soft and refreshing

I love these wipes. I highly recommend them.

These wipes are soft on the skin and leaves it moisturized. Although I still use my normal moisturizer after use.

Great product

I got hooked on eye make up remover’s.  A great deal!

Good quality, cleans the face well, and convenient. Definitely recommend

I have used Neutrogena makeup remover for a number of years and have no allergies to its formulas.  Wonderful product.

Good price

saves time

I have been using these for years, and love them.  Tried others but always came back to these.

Gentle yet effective cleansing properties. I love that they are fragrance free! Perfect for quick makeup removal. Suitable for sensitive skin and around the eyes.

Easy to use and I take my makeup off while watching movies or TV!

I love these face wipes. Mascara comes right off with a swipe. Smell nice and leave face feeling clean

Love these, and they're so cheap! They leave a little bit of a dry feeling on your face, but I also have pretty dry skin and am more sensitive to that, so it's nothing moisturizer can't fix. Love them!

It removes makeup  💄  perfectly...

I would definitely buy this product again!

If on the go I grab these or if I have a late night and don’t want to take out the bottle and dump it everywhere lol. The makeup comes right off with no issues. I also have sensitive skin and it doesn’t bother me.

I love these towelettes.  They really get the makeup off, especially my eyeliner.  I wish they were a little bigger in size though, but they still do the job.  I’ve tried their brand of liquid remover and can’t stand it.  The liquid doesn’t work as well and feels like there is a ton of oil in it, even though it’s advertised as oil free.  The liquid is hard to use and doesn’t do a great job getting mascara off compared to the wipes.  After using the wipes, I just wipe my face off with a wet wash cloth and my face feels good.  No oily reside and the makeup is gone.  I’ve already repurchased two more packs.  I highly recommend this product.

my go to makeup wipes, works great and removes all makeup!

I use these to remove makeup before washing face. Easy to transport.

Great product. Great price.

Does the job removing makeup. Have to use extra for eye makeup. Leaves skin soft.

I never knew they came in a fragrance free. I used to get the original wipes and did not really like the smell of them. Now that they found the fragrance free I will continue to get these for now on.

Cleans Nicely

GREAT VALUE AND PRODUCT FOR DRY MATURE SKIN

These wipes make it very easy to remove my make up. They are soft to the feel and very refreshing. I have used them for years now and I accidentally left them open for the air to dri them out. I added a little water to them and closed them up for 24 hours and it was like it it never happened. Great value for the money

Cleans all makeup off. Live fragrance free.

These wipes work well I can even use each side of them for heavy spots of makeup.

Eco friendly, medium hard. great price - quality

The product comes packaged in cardboard, two toothbrushes per pack. Bristles are soft. Seem to be well made. Nice bamboo feel.

These toothbrushes are not only wholesome and Eco-friendly, but they brush well. So far they have lasted almost as equally long as a plastic toothbrush.

Decided to give these a try over my candy-colored expensive toothbrush from the typical toothpaste manufacturers. I always thought their medium-bristles, pointed in all directions, and funky shaped handles would give you the best clean. But I frequently had bleeding gums from the medium bristles. My dentist always tells me to get soft bristled brushes, and I found these.Been using one of these a week now. Have to say I'm impressed. The bristles are very soft and gentle, yet clean just as well as my previous brushes. Haven't had any issues with my gums. The handle is easy to hold and so light weight. It hasn't fallen apart in my hands or left me with splinters. I figure even if I get a month out of each brush, using these will still be less expensive than my previous brushes, and less plastic waste that goes into the trash. Great toothbrushes to take on travel because if you lose it, no big deal.So I'm happy with these. I even gave a few away to some friends for them to try after telling them about the brushes. I'll be ordering more and happy to recommend them to others.

I was in dire need of a new toothbrush. I was probably six months overdue for one but I kept putting it off, because I hated the idea of throwing my plastic one in the garbage. I was debating on getting those battery operated ones but knew the plastic waste would be just as bad. I brushed off the idea of a bamboo toothbrush for so long because I figured they wouldn't work well. I was wrong.First off, the bristles are soft. But I was so in need of a new toothbrush that the first time I used the bamboo one, my gums bled a little bit in some areas. My guess is the bristles were so done on my old toothbrush that the new, straight bristles really jostled my gums. But it was in a good way - it felt like I was really getting everything nice and cleaned out. The second thing I noticed was that the feel of bamboo against my mouth as I'm brushing is fairly unpleasant. I didn't think it would be a huge deal but it really took some getting used to. I have some lip vaseline so I decided to rub that on the back of the toothbrush and it help it glide more while I brushed.I'd say so far I'm happy that these are an alternative to plastic brushes. And they are really affordable! For $7, I get enough toothbrushes for the year. I like that they are numbered in case you need to give somebody one. The packaging isn't wasteful or overkill - I can't stand when companies use super nice, over-the-top packing for something that is just going to go in the trash. Sure, it's "luxe" and looks great for unboxing videos, but for the general population, I don't need anything that extra. So the simplicity of this company's packaging was really refreshing.My teeth look cleaner after brushing with these. Again, part of that was due to the fact that my old toothbrush was dead. But it's good to know that these will get rid of just as much stuff as any other brush. It's only a $7 gamble so I'd say go for it and give these a shot. I'm not sure how "hygienic" putting a swipe of vaseline on the back of the brush is, but I'd give it a try if you don't like the feeling right away.

Feels different than the plastic toothbrush, much cleaner feeling.

My fiance and I really like these toothbrushes. Nothing special to them, but they are nice and lightweight, we like the bristles. I open up a new twin pack probably every other month.

Have used these before and really like the toothbrushes themselves. Good quality brushes and I like the soft bristles. Love that they are eco friendly.I also originally thought the packaging was great since it’s all cardboard. However, on my last order I noticed one of the inner boxes looked sort of banged up at the end. I figured no big deal, cardboard might get dented in transit but that’s worth it for the sustainability. However, I found two toothbrushes stuffed in that box which led me to deduce that someone must have opened a toothbrush, taken it out, then put it back (in the wrong box) and returned it. I then realized that there is nothing to stop people from taking the toothbrushes out of the package, then putting them back and returning them (and then the company can sell them again, most of the time you wouldn’t realize it had been opened). For something like a toothbrush that’s going in my mouth, that’s a deal breaker for me. Should have better tamper proofing. There are other sustainable toothbrush options that are individually sealed within compostable paper packages.

These are perfect for my partner and I. Before I got these on Prime Day I was buying packages of 2 at TJ Maxx for 3.99 or so, but I got this entire package for just a bit more. I'm happy that we can tell them apart by the bristle colors, and I joked that we won't have to buy more toothbrushes for years, which thrills me! We were trying to decide between these and going for electric toothbrushes, but decided that from a sustainability perspective, these are preferable.

These are great. My husband uses one color and I use the other so they are a great purchase for us.

The bristles fall out when you brush & our teeth don’t feel clean after brushing. We were hoping for a non-plastic option, but it’s back to the drawing board we go!

The bristles are still nylon,like every other toothbrush.. the handle may be bamboo but who cares about the handle?? I am disappointed in this.. charcoal infused is not charcoal..

They are extremely large. Long bristles that hurt my gums and make them bleed every time. They left my gums swollen since the first time I used it.It barely fits in my mouth is hard to brush and they don’t even clean my teeth is the absolute worst toothbrush. Worst than a dollar store brush.Do not recommend at all.

A conscientious idea, but a horrible product. The bamboo head of the brush is too bulky for reaching between the inside of the mouth and the teeth, especially the last molars in the back, and I agree with some of the other reviewers, because of the bulkiness, the brush has the tendency to cause gagging when trying to reach the back teeth. And the surface of the bamboo toothbrush is rougher than that of a conventional plastic toothbrush and makes it even harder to glide through between the inside of the mouth and the teeth. Other than its aesthetic natural look and environmental friendliness, NOT recommended for practical use.

Cheap, don’t leave your teeth feeling brushed, bristles are too soft. Waste of money

After using the brush, I placed it inside a regular holder. The next day it had fuzz on it. I thought it was just the wood doing what natural wood does. But I decided to just use another one. I threw the used one away. Took the trash out that evening and it started to mold. If you get these brushes, understand based off your location and humidity in the home the brushes can serious be just one maybe two uses. Find a way to dry them throughly if you plan on using them longer term.

Not sure if all bamboo toothbrushes do this but this is my only gripe. Within a week of using I noticed a dark film at the lower end of our toothbrushes. I cleaned the cup I usually leave my toothbrush in just to make sure there was no leftover water or anything at the bottom, scrubbed the toothbrush and yet the color continued to happen

The reviews are clearly fake. This is one of those that comes from the C word country. The toothbrush probably cost about 2 cents to make, and it shows. It's big and clunky. Don't throw away your old toothbrushes until you use it, since you will want them again after. When you brush with this, it feels like it isn't doing anything. Super weak bristles. I just can't accept all of those 5 star reviews saying this was the best toothbrush they ever used? Really? All fake and phony. Take heed. I want to save the planet, but the products must at least be as good as what they replace.

Its hard to describe but my gums and mouth hurts after using the toothbrush. I have no idea why but I have had to discontinue use.

I've used a few different brands of bamboo/charcoal tooth brushes and this is the first time one has smelled so bad. Like a very plastiy-chemical smell. Its been a few days and it still smells. I would not buy again

I was looking forward to these, finally no more plastic toothbrushes. First time I used one, the bristles fell out and got stuck in my throat, not a pleasant predicament. This happened again on subsequent tries with different brushes so I stopped using them…giant waste of money and resources!

I've used several toothbrushes and each time I've had bristles stab me in my gums. This has also happened to my 9 year old once and she had to back to a regular toothbrush. I have to brush with caution

Disappointing. The bristles fall out constantly so we’re all pulling them out of our mouths after we brush. The wood is not smooth, it’s quite rough, like it hasn’t been sanded down, and hurts our mouths. Also, as soon as the toothbrush comes into contact with water, the polished look is immediately dulled and you’re left with what is essentially and unfinished piece of wood. We’ll keep trying different brands until we find a good one. It’s a bummer that these didn’t work because the numbered system is clever and we’re wanting to use as little plastic as possible.

These wooden sticks will leave you wondering if your lips/mouth got lacerated by tiny splinters after every brush. This morning I was spitting out alot of blood when it opened up my canker sore. Promptly threw the rest of the product away. Don't buy!

I was using this toothbrush and I noticed that my lips were tender. With the second use I realized that the bamboo had splinters and was literally cutting my lips and there was blood all over. I had to throw away the first toothbrush after the second use and I threw the other ones away because I didn’t want to deal with that again. My lips are sore and I have one area that bled quite a bit.

I thought I could love these toothbrushes. They are soft, cleaned my teeth well and are very light (we took them on a trip). Unfortunately the bristles kept falling out. Not sure if it was just a bad batch, but both my hubby's and mine kept falling out while brushing (at least 1 to two every time we brushed) which left this wiry bristle in your mouth while you brushed. Needless to say, not too happy, especially while on vacation.

Bought these because I wanted a less wasteful alternative to the traditional plastic toothbrush, and I hadn't had good luck with a different brand of biodegradable ones. After less than a month of using this toothbrush it grew black mold all along the handle. I'm really hoping this was a one-time thing, because I like these brushes otherwise.

These brushes are so cheap and soft that they didn’t clean my teeth well at all and within a month of using them regularly I had cavities for the first time in my life. That’s not to mention the splinters I got from the wood and the fact that the bristles would come out in my mouth. I want to be eco-friendly but it’s not worth it at the expense of my oral health. Don’t bother.

The order was for 4 toothbrushes.I received one container filled with 4 little boxes. Three of them had a toothbrush inside, but one was empty. It was the first little box I opened too, so that was a confusing experience to open an empty box. Thankfully the other three weren't empty but this was disappointing.I have not tried the toothbrushes yet.

Bristles work well. However, if you use a holder like I do the toothbrush will start molding after two days. Smells really bad.

When I opened the package one of the toothbrushes didn't have an individual box. When I pulled it out it had the words "used" written on it and the bristles were older and clearly had been used. All the other toothbrushes were fine and were great quality. I have photos but for some reason they wouldn't upload

My son had a splinter from the handle lodged in his mouth. Trashing the rest as it's too late to return.

The bristles fall off while you’re brushing your teeth and they can get stuck in your throat do not buy this unless you want to get the bristles stuck in your throat

Wasn't happy with them.. they molded very quickly. I would even leave my toothbrush out to dry before putting it in my toothbrush case and mold still grew very quickly. Mold appeared within 2 weeks of using it/them.

Love the idea of this. Glad they are available. Unfortunately my gums are sore now. I thought it was just me so I asked him what he thought and he said the same thing. We won’t be purchasing again.I really don’t know if it whitened or just made my gums red, which makes you teeth look whiter. It travels just as good as any other toothbrush. It is soft.

these brushes made my teeth extremely sensitive for days. so i stopped using them immediately. my teeth and gums never hurt so bad before… but i liked the environment friendly aspect.

I liked them until they started getting moldy, the bamboo. (I switched them out every month)

The shape of this toothbrush head is basically square. Imagine trying to fit a lego between your back gums and lip. It's too big, so it can't reach the outside of my back teeth at all. The bristles were also just too soft for my preference. Love that they're biodegradable, but unfortunately they are unusable. I use them for cleaning now. Very surprised at the number of positive reviews!

The first toothbrush I used the bristles started coming out in my mouth. I was able to spit all of them out except for one which I swallowed. Disgusting, I'll never buy from seller again.

I don't know how these are getting such good reviews. Both of the people in our house that tried these found they caused splinters and micro-abrasions in our gums. And it's not because they are too stiff. I usually use medium bristles. These seem to just have extremely soft, but needle-sharp bristles for some reason. They are also not even biodegradable since the bristles are still made of plastic, so there really isn't any reason to buy these.

Don't buy  I am giving it one star because I don't have an option which is lower than one star.

I do not recommend this toothbrush. I've only been using it for about 5 weeks and almost every time I use it, at least one (but usually more than that) of the thick black bristles comes off in my mouth and it's like having a thick hair in my mouth - really gross. Returning for something of higher quality.

Love the idea of bamboo and biodegradable but these are not good for the mouth.  Bamboo soft at first but becomes rough after only a few uses.  Disappointed because I hate the fact that we throw away plastic toothbrushes.  Searched for alternative and found wheatstraw biodegradable toothbrushes.  Head of brush is kind of small but the material is much smoother like plastic and seems to work fine so far.

This is my 2nd brand of bamboo toothbrush I’ve tried. The bristles on these brushes fall of way to easily and get stuck in your mouth. I think I actually swallowed one of two which I’m not too happy about. I also found the brush head to be too narrow and far too soft. Would love to get my money back but I used one brush.

I'm not a fan of this brand. These are not soft brushes. So, if your teeth are sensitive, stay away. Also, the wood cracks easily, and you can come away with a small bunch of bristles in your mouth. The durability is unreliable. Not good quality.

So I missed my return window but I was trying to give these a chance since I want to move away from plastic. I'm on my second brush and it's been weeks of pain. I thought maybe the first one was just messed up but no, it's all of them. I think maybe the bristles aren't held together properly. My gums get scratched each and every time I use them.

I really wanted to like these and at first did, but they cut my mouth so they’re unusable. I have little bleeding cuts in the inside corners of my mouth after about a week, so I’m sure I had micro cuts before then. Not worth it.

Would not buy again! Not fun picking bristles out of your mouth!

Ordered medium hardness but these things are way too soft, useless!

I tried one of these for two days. If you're aiming for sore gum these are perfect. The bristles are so skinny and pointy I had irritated gums for the next couple days. They're also so soft I didn't feel like they actually cleaned my teeth. There are much better options out there.

Although I love the bamboo handle, the bristles are still Nylon which leads to micro plastic exposure.  I bought these without fully looking at the materials which is my mistake, but I will not be buying these again. Instead I will be getting ones with boar bristles. Hope this helps!

I really wanted to love these, the bristles hurt mine and my son’s gums. They are VERY pokey and not smooth. I used one of the toothbrushes for a week and just couldn’t anymore. I have never had a bristle hurt like this.

I'm trying to cut down on my use of plastic.  I was expecting and prepared for some reduction in quality, as long as it wasn't severe.  I really tried to make this item work.  But the bristles are way too soft for me.  I am a "brush hard, sometimes until your gums bleed" person.  These bristles don't clean my teeth.  I end up having to use my plastic-bristle toothbrush to brush my teeth again afterward, so there's really no point in using the bamboo toothbrush.  If you like soft bristles, you'll love this toothbrush, because it's so soft you won't even feel it on your teeth.

I bought a large pack of toothbrushes from this company in 2019 and finally needed a new pack. I went through my orders and found the old listing, and it brought me straight to this page. Unfortunately, there has been a change in production since I last ordered a toothbrush from this company. The old bristles were softer and the plugs were a little more rounded than pointed (you can't really tell because the old toothbrush was well loved, sorry). These new toothbrushes have slightly more angled bristles-- they come to a little point, which would be good for deep cleaning if the nylon wasn't so hard.Pros--- Biodegradable handles (just rip the nylon out with pliers first)- toothbrush handle is more ergonomic and easy to hold than previous versionCons--- Harder bristles than previous productions- "soft" isn't listed anywhere on the packaging. These feel like mediums.- will make more sensitive gums bleedThe company just needs to update their listing and packaging to say medium, or if they've changed the nylon and this is their "soft", they need to not let old listings forward to this version.

The bamboo handle is fine but after brushing my teeth with this toothbrush, my gums feel very irritated and my mouth hurts. I have gave it a few tries even tried brushing gently and it still irritates me. I wouldnt recommend.

Buying these toothbrushes seemed like a good idea.  However, some significant design flaws made it to where I won't use these again for brushing my teeth (one of the clean ones got delegated to my guitar maintenance kit... not sure what I'll do with the other two.)First impressions before use:The toothbrush felt flat in my hands.  Kind of reminded me of the toothbrushes I grew up with (I used to heat the plastic and bend them so they could be "fancy" like the old Reach brushes.)  The bristles were narrow, much like the free brushes you'd get from the dentist back in the 80's.  I did appreciate the softness, and the old-fashioned looks.  I wasn't sure how clean it would get my teeth.Actually using:I would say that this brush did an okay job cleaning my teeth.  Better than I had expected.  I suspect many of the design features of modern tooth brushes are mostly for aesthetics (with some minor improvements of functionality.)  My major complaint for these bamboo brushes is the tip.  I estimate the tip extends about 3/16 past the bristles.  This is a major problem if you plan to brush your back teeth...  I experienced quite a bit of bruising of tissue and some bleeding about the ramus of my mandible.  The only way to avoid this is to not brush your back teeth.Final Thoughts:Don't buy these if you use proper brushing techniques.

I did see other people say it scratched their gums when they used it but I hoped it would dull over time. It doesn't. My kids won't use them and I suffer through it whenever I do. I'm done. Don't Buy!

These toothbrushes would have received 5 stars but I have them 2 stars because they're pointy. These are not flat toothbrushes. Therefore,  every time you brush your teeth, your gums and teeth are being stabbed by the toothbrush and it hurt very bad.  I do not recommend these at all.

The bristles on the brush fall out very easily while using it, leaving bristles stuck in your mouth.

Bristles come out all the time.

This was a disappointing buy. I purchased it thinking I was being more environmentally friendly, not realizing that it had nylon bristles. I might have been able to overlook that if the nylon bristles had at least cleaned my teeth, but they didn't. My teeth often felt just as dirty after using both toothbrushes as they did before & I noticed my oral health declining overall. Switched back to a plastic brush & my mouth tastes better, my teeth feel cleaner, & my smile looks whiter.There are some really good bamboo tooth brushes out there, but this isn't one of them.

Unless you’re a fan of the bamboo, I do not recommend these. The bristles hurt my gums extremely bad and you taste wood the entire time. I bought these bc of how bad the plastic is to use everyday but I just started to switch out my toothbrushes a lot more often because these were terrible.

I really looked forward to my order though upon arrival it looked as if the toothbrush boxes had been opened.  So I requested a replacement, well that box looked the same.  Had to return both, my oral care is important so I will not waiver if I cannot feel secure that any of my hygiene products are not tampered with without some sort of tamper proof methods used.

The bushes are fine but package came with 6 small boxes inside, each box supposedly has 2 tooth brushes insude...i didn't check each of box when i got it but i just found last night that one small box only has 1 tooth brush inside...so, i only got 11 tooth brushes..Make sure you check each box when you receive the product.

I wanted to like these. I should have known better because I have sensory issues and have never been able to so much as hand wash a wooden spoon without being uncomfortable. They came packaged well, individually boxed. Bristles seemed ok, but I can't deal with the wooden handle rubbing on the inside of my cheek and lips. I used a few for cleaning around the house and gave the rest to my daughter. They don't seem to bother her.

Trying to be more Green, I ordered these toothbrushes and they work really well, however, often while brushing,  the tiny bristles come out in the mouth - something you would not want to accidently swallow.If it weren't for that one problem, I would reccomend them.

I was really hoping to like these toothbrushes because I hadn't used a bamboo or charcoal brush before. I do have sensitivity, but these made it worse. The bristles, although soft, really bothered my gums. I tried to lighten the brushing to see if I was pressing down too hard, but that didn't seem to work. I now use the remaining brushes to help clean around the house.

I love the idea behind these toothbrushes!Pros:Soft, functional, biodegradableCons:The bristles fall out while brushing. Typically one every time I brush. I don’t know what it is about that but nothing makes me want to gag more. It’s like having hair in my mouth. I have to stop and dig the single bristle out of my mouth in the middle of brushing my teeth. Yuck!To be fair, it could be a personal thing but I think there is too much wood above the bristles. It prevents the brush from sitting comfortably against the very back molars because the wood isn’t carved out close enough to the bristles at the top. This causes me to either not brush my molars thoroughly or to be uncomfortable since I’m poking the back of my mouth while brushing.

Okay guys sometimes the reviews are right. I just got these yesterday. I was really excited cause I've been using bamboo toothbrushes for months now, but was hoping for a less expensive version without any plastic. The kind i bought was a little over 16 dollars but the bristles were plastic. I thought I'd try these cause they were bamboo and had charcoal bristles instead. I started brushing my teeth with them last night. No problem. This morning.... my mouth started bleeding. There's little splinters coming out of it. This is painful and frankly not worth it. I'll stick to the more expensive kind from now on cause it doesn't brutalize my mouth. There's a reason these are on sale...

I really wanted to like these. The packaging was great, ergonomics is good, the bristles really seem to be the perfect shape and texture for a really good cleaning. However the bamboo slices up the inside of your cheeks and mouth! I had to stop using after 2 brushes because the corners of my mouth were starting to bleed from the bamboo rubbing them raw. Trying to figure out if there's a way to coat them in something so I don't have to toss them all in the compost...

This product isn't great. It is extremely soft and doesn't have much charcoal in the bristles... also strange that it came mixed with white brushes of the same quality. They don't seem like they're doing the job and I have to order a different brand.

This brand is flimsy and not worth it. So many come in a box so I’ll get my moneys worth. I won’t re-purchase though.

Great idea, great intent, the bamboo is strong and antibacterial, the charcoal bristles are cool and strong at first... but after a couple uses, the toothbrush isn’t that strong. Over a couple days, I noticed that the bristles seemingly weakened and I felt my teeth weren’t feeling clean despite spending a good amount of time cleaning them. My breath and mouth were fine and overall felt clean, but my teeth weren’t being well cleaned. The brush gets in between teeth well, but doesn’t clean the teeth/food well after a couple of uses.I’ll update the review if anything changes, but I was disappointed because I really liked it at first, they’re four toothbrushes, and it’s supposedly “anti-plaque.”

The whole family was excited and on board with this cost effective switch.  We liked that they were numbered from 1-4 to make it easy for to see who’s was who’s, and agreed that these are much more stylish than our old toothbrushes.Unfortunately, not a single one of us enjoys actually using these tooth brushes.  From the bristles falling out and getting stuck between our teeth, to the fact that it’s pretty difficult to get those molars truly clean, we all agree, these toothbrushes are form over function, and it’s back to plastic for us!

These arrived well packaged and look like they're good quality, but upon trying them I realized they're not for me. Maybe it's just because I have a small mouth /and/ my teeth are sensitive... but the brush felt bulky and uncomfortable in my mouth and tasted a little odd. Just not my thing.

The toothbrush has a nice feel in the hand in terms of weight and grip, and the bristles are comfortable and get the job done--when they stay in the brush. From the first brush to the last, I was spitting a lost bristle or two out of my mouth. With one brush, clumps of bristles fell out the first time--and the last time--I used it. Sorry, Isshah, I won't buy your brand again.

I wish I could say I like these brushes. Unfortunately, after a month or so of use, I had to stop. I usually prefer tougher bristles, and these felt uncomfortably rough and sharp on my gums. My mouth hurt for a few minutes after use every time. The bristles initially felt soft when I ran them on my fingers, but the experience was just not pleasant.I really want to support sustainable products like bamboo toothbrushes. In the age we live in, living an eco-friendly lifestyle is of utmost importance. However, I cannot support the products if they are not user-friendly.

I like the bamboo handle, but the bristles are so basic and soft it doesn't clean my teeth well.

I bought it as an option for biodegrade brushes , however it gives weird taste after brushing. Not planning to buy it again.

Good product. The bristles are soft. But they provide full coverage over the tooth when brushing. The packaging is a box with 4 smaller individual boxes inside for each brush. So for an eco-friendly product, the packaging, though biodegradable is excessive. I was hesitant about this product but I would recommend. I have used the tooth brush for less than a week and the brush has start to deteriorate, and thus is showing splintered areas. I can feel the splinters when I run my fingers over it, so I am no longer using it. Good idea, but it didn't work out for me.

There's soft and there's "I barely tickled my teeth and they still don't feel clean." Amazon thought these would be a good replacement for my normal subscription.... but, I must say, they are so soft I don't think they're doing anything.

I loved my toothbrush at first. I just tried to switch to a new one since I had a deep cleaning today. The other brushes were still sealed in their boxes and each one was COVERED in mold. Not a spot, they were covered. The outer box had none on it and and nothing else I that drawer had any mold. Now I am nervous about what I had been brushing with for the last couple months.

I've been gradually making eco friendly swaps and I ordered these when I needed new toothbrushes. I figured my husband wouldn't like them because he's an intense brusher but I figured however soft they may be I could deal. But these bristles are so soft it just felt like I was using a feather. If you can deal with really soft bristles these would be fine but otherwise probably not worth the try.

This is a hard bristled toothbrush. At first usage, it was phenomenal. However, after using for a few days, my gums started to become red and sore. My teeth, however, were indeed whiter! But, my mouth was sore for about 2 weeks after usage of this product. I do not recommend. But, will always try alternatives. It just sucks that out of necessity, I had to buy a stupid plastic toothbrush at the local store ANYWAY.

I like the idea of reducing the waste, an alternative to plastic. I used these for more than 6 mos. Per my dentist though they dont really do a great job of cleaning... have had great cleaning and visits but there was a noticable difference in plaque deposits. They have a flat bristle area so the lack of contour didnt really do as well at cleaning. The bristles were very rigid and I found that they caused my gums to bleed at first. I am a little disappointed.

Its just okay. Don't have a tongue scraping thing in d back. I wouldn't buy again.

I love the idea behind these. They are inexpensive enough but after 2-3 uses you can definitely tell you have wet wood in your mouth. The handle starts to feel splintery as well. The bristles are super soft so it doesn’t feel like it cleans that well.  I would bring them on trips with me to use as a disposable toothbrush, but that’s about it.

These are great with the exemption that are really small. They are just too small (the brush portion) handle is fine. I feel that they are ok for a kid but not for an adult. I feel like I’m brushing with feathers instead of an actual toothbrush. The vendor should post the size in the description.

Originally I thought it was a pretty cool idea to have a toothbrush made of wood, but after using it (and maybe its just the way I brush my teeth) but I found the inside of my lips were getting torn up after brushing. Think it must have something to do with the wood not being sanded down enough and then rubbing against the inside of my mouth.

I originally gave this product 5 stars but as time went on the bristles irritated my gums and I had to stop using.I have repurposed them as "massagers" to use to relieve tension in my face and neck and stimulate lymphatic drainage (I use the back of the toothbrush, not the bristle side.)

I was initially wary of trying this brand and read other reviews stating that the bristles were soft. Unfortunately, they're not and I really was looking forward to replacing my plastic toothbrush with something more eco-friendly. Added to the medium/hard bristles, after two weeks of using them the bristles started to fall out while brushing! Please consider re-designing the bristles as I do like the bamboo/100% compostable idea.

This toothbrush was great for about a month. The bristles began to fall out around a month though so it’s good they come in a pack.... because you’re going to need to swap them more frequently. I’m happy they’re biodegradable bc of their short life span. Wouldn’t recommend this brand.

I liked the feel of the handle and the bristles were quite soft to the touch, but I think because the bristles are uneven heights, the longer ones poke at the gums in a weird way and make them really irritated, no matter how softly I brush. Can't continue using them.

I wanted to love this product so bad... At first they were great, but after a couple of weeks of use the wood began to hurt parts of my mouth while using. I have reverted to plastic toothbrushes ever since.

Once the wood handle gets wet it feels like finger nails on a chalk board.  Not a good feeling.  Also they are all identical except for little numbers on each handle.  If you wear reading glasses it is hard to tell them apart.  I don't like using someone else's toothbrush.

I wanted to like these.  I got these for me and my partner but when we brushed our teeth, it caused extreme teeth sensitivity which made it difficult to brush properly.  We were using Toms toothpaste so not sure if we needed to use a different kind.

I used mine for a few nights before giving up on it. They're just not good. The wood is too thick and it bumps up painfully against the back of my guns while brushing, and the bristles are too soft but somehow also able to cut up my gums. I feel guilty because I want to use a more sustainable toothbrush option but this just wasn't the answer.

I love the idea of these, but in reality, they don't live up to the hype. One got moldy. The bamboo is a natural, porous material so of course it would be prone to mold. The bristles also tear up my gums. I've never had gum issues. I do now. They are tender and swollen. Going back to something more traditional.

It’s a soft brush and I like that it’s biodegradable. It isn’t curved so it’s hard to use and the head keeps hitting my jaw and the hard angles hit my gums. I wouldn’t buy again.  The idea is good, but the design isn’t.

Love the idea and these seem to hold up well. But one major flaw in my eyes is the bristle placement. There is a large gap at the end of toothbrush that does not have bristles on it! Toothbrush hits back of my mouth but with the bristle placement the bristles do not! Cannot reach the back of my teeth:(

The charcoal burns and irritates my gums.

In trying to elementary the plastic toothbrushes and the electronic ones that seemed to collect gunk in the handle, I gave these a try. I am not impressed with the wood turning black if it lays on one side and I noticed I have had to pick little black specs out from between the bristles. Probably will not order these again.

I wanted to love these inexpensive eco-friendly brushes, but the bridles fall out. I use them as travel toothbrushes and each time I end up with a few little sticks in my mouth. I will still use them but will not give to my son.

I like that these are very soft but the bristles are always falling out shortly after using them.

I like these for being a better alternative to plastic brushes. They clean my teeth as well as traditional plastic brush. Only complaint is that bristles keep coming loose. The loose bristles are more an annoyance than a deal breaker for me but my more sensitive wife it was a deal breaker.

I have bought and love the soft but functional bristles of my Brush With Bamboo brand brushes. This much less expensive brand’s bristles are ridiculously soft and make for unacceptable brushing. My 102 year old grandma says, “Cheap is dear”. I agree. I’ll go for the quality of Brush with Bamboo brand next time.

I wasnt sure what to expect but I was pretty happy. The bristles are soft but almost needle like so they clean nicely in the gums but it made me bleed the first few times. The wood is ok but gets drier after every use and it feels like I'm brushing my teeth with a popsicle stick

I believed the bristles were soft, however there are some reasons why I wouldn't buy these again. One, after some time mold begins to grow. I didn't find that very appealing, but I made sure to finish the whole box. Secondly, be aware that the bristles can begin to work its way out and become lodged in between your teeth. I like the idea of less plastic waste, but this didn't work well for me.

I ordered the 4 pack, and while there were 4 individual boxes within the larger box, only 3 of the individual boxes actually contained a toothbrush! I have been shorted 1 toothbrush!As for the quality, they seem okay as long as you can deal with the rough dry wood handles. I find that they sometimes cause me to want to gag when the dryness is touching the inside of my mouth

The bristles were very sharp on my sensitive gums with the first few uses. Overtime the bristles soften, but they also fall out and get in your mouth which is an uncomfortable feeling. I do believe they are eco friendly, but I can’t say whether the bristles have charcoal or that my teeth have become whiter. The brush is also uncomfortable in your hand because of the wood. I love the idea of an ecofriendly toothbrush, but this wasn’t it for me. Wouldn’t recommend or buy again.

The only reason why I gave this product a 3/5 and not a full 5 is because I didn't realize at first that this isn't fully biodegradable, which I wish the seller would make more clear! Even on the box it says you can bury it in the earth and it will fully degrade, which isn't true! The bristles are made from nylon which has NO biodegradable forms! Only the handle is biodegradable. This toothbrush is still nice because it causes less waste in the environment, but it's not completely waste free. As for the product itself, it's just fine. The bristles are very soft and the brush has a nice grip. It even reaches into my furthest molars very easily. It's way more comfortable than my old plastic toothbrush. I just wish that it was waste free!

Dislike the wood in my mouth.  Brush is perfect

It works fine, but it’s harder than I thought it would be and every time I brush I find a loose bristle somewhere in my mouth.

The notion that every toothbrush I've ever owned still exists prompted me to try these.  I think they are just fine.  They are soft but I've beat up my gums for too long with firmer bristles anyway.  The only change I would make is to offer them as a bulk pack.  Each brush does not need it's own box within a box.After using these for a while I'm adding commentary about an issue and lowering my rating.  The bristles come loose and I find them stuck in my gums and that is annoying.  I don't think I would buy them again.

I use my own toothpowder with these, the bristles slip out very easily and trigger gag reflex.

I love the environmentally friendly aspect of these but after a couple uses it started to feel like I might get slivers in my cheeks. I haven't yet but it feels like it. Also, I use a charcoal toothpaste powder and it seeps into the wood which shows that it is eternally unclean! Kinda gross that it shows how much toothpaste, germs, dirt, whatever you want to call it gets stuck in the wood as you brush. I'll probably try a different brand next time.Update:These definitely have given me slivers! In my lips, cheeks, gums, and even under my tongue. Maybe try a different brand?

Bristles are deceiving as they are extremely soft to the touch but once in use hurt a lot. You have to use a really light touch or it hurts your gums. Handle is awkward to hold because of flat square handle and for some reason cuts the inner corner of my lips. I personally don’t recommend but my daughter actually really likes it so she gives it 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Nothing about it bothers her so 🤷🏻‍♀️

I really like the idea of using bamboo toothbrushes to help cut down on the plastic sitting in landfills. I often check for more sustainable produce substitutes, so I was really excited to try the bamboo toothbrushes. At this point, I've been using them for a few months now. They work well for the first month or so, but I've already gone through two of them. The bristles start to fall off at the top. It's really disgusting when you find one in your mouth mid brush and start gagging. You can't keep using one for a full 3 months like a standard toothbrush unfortunately.

I recently switched to a bamboo toothbrush trying to be a mindful consumer. However this wasn’t my best purchase, every time I brush my teeth with this brush I don’t feel like it really cleans them the best. Maybe it’s the soft bristles but if you’re used to a normal toothbrush and prefer the sturdiness of the bristles on traditional ones, don’t get this one.

These are just too soft for me.  I don’t feel like the bristles are strong enough to properly clean, and I’ll look for another brand that is more along a medium range next time.  Also, there is no coating on the wood as mentioned in the description.  It soaks in toothpaste, etc.  I do leave it sitting sideways.  They are still better than regular plastic toothbrushes, but I’m not impressed compared to other brands of bamboo brushes I’ve tried.

This brush came packaged nicely and it was a good price for 4 brushes. However, the bristles were way too soft, and I wasn't getting a good clean, even if I brushed for more than 2 minutes. This would be good for people with soft or sensitive teeth, but for me, it just wasn't worth using since it wasn't cleaning my mouth properly.

These toothbrushes make my gums so unhappy and swollen despite the super softness of the bristles. Nothing else in my oral hygiene has changed or my diet but my mouth feels awful. I thought I just needed an adjustment period, but I'm two weeks in and definitely have to discontinue using this. Also, as many other reviews mention, the bristles do fall out and the bamboo feels awful in your hand. I could get used to all that, though, if my gums weren't so inflamed.

Way too soft and can’t properly clean tarter

I like the idea of these and really wanted to love them. The bristles are super soft and my mouth feels clean after brushing. Unfortunately I just can't get over the wooden handle. It sounds weird but something about it gives me these weird goosebumps... it's like those ice cream cups that came with wooden spoons, I can't handle that wooden texture. It got to the point that I was dreading brushing my teeth. I'm keeping the rest to have available as guest brushes, but unfortunately just not for me.

Won't purchase again. After only a few uses it slowly begins to slointer off and is uncomfortable to hold

I really like the idea of a biodegradable toothbrush, but I’m not a fan of this particular one. The bristles fall out in my mouth as I’m brushing, which just feels gross. My teeth don’t feel as clean as when I use my “regular” toothbrush, even if I brush for longer or use more pressure. I’ll probably use the rest of this pack for cleaning and try a different biodegradable/ sustainable toothbrush.

Review for the toothbrush: 4 starsReview for reason to buy product: 1 starThe toothbrush is nice and has very soft bristles. I’m very disappointed though (not sure if this is the sellers issue or amazons), but the reason to buy this product is to reduce waste... it came in a plastic shipping bag which completely negates my reason to buy. So sad- thought I was doing something good but in reality made no impact. For this reason I wouldn’t buy again.

After using bamboo toothbrushes for about a year now, I have noticed my gums are wearing down a lot. It's not the tooth brush's fault, but because it is really hard to find a medium-strength bristle brush I often over brush to get the same clean feeling as with a normal toothbrush. If you don't like soft bristled brushes I would skip out on this one and find a bamboo brush with harder bristles (they do exist).

For me there is to much wood expanding past the bristles from the top of the brush ie.  I cant really reach the back teeth with the bristles because the wood runs into my guns first.  Great quality but maybe a more oval shape the bristles closer to the ends of the tooth brush.  I would love to order more and give to my family, but will not because of this.Please notify me is the shape changes.

The only thing wrong about these toothbrushes is that the bristles fall out very quickly. I applied a lot of pressure on my teeth when I brushed them because I want to make them clean and the bristles literally fell out so that’s a bummer but other than that, it works great! I wouldn’t say it really whitens your teeth but it’s overall a good toothbrush.

I think Quality control was off the day my toothbrush pack went through. My number 4 brush is cracked on the side and missing a bristle. Not going to return it because I threw my old toothbrush out before I opened the boxes so I needed a toothbrush. Besides that issue I like the product it does what I need it to do. Bristles are too soft for me but it seems all of the biodegradable toothbrushes have soft bristles.

I love the premise of these toothbrushes, but I found that they were very hard on my gums. I used them for 5 days, but my mouth remained sore so I switched back to a extra soft bristle brush. I think the bristles may be too fine, to the point that they irritate my gums.Maybe I’m over sensitive. They’re worth a try.

The head of the brush is a little boxy and uncomfortable, it feels like there's quite a bit of space between the age of the bristles and the toothbrush.  I use a sonicare in the morning and at night, this is just for mid day freshen up, so  I'm not sure how well this actually cleans teeth and gets to all the hard to reach places, if I were to use it as my only toothbrush.

I bought them to try to be more conscious about the products I buy.  The toothbrush was sufficiently soft and cleans well.  The biggest drawback is that the wood tastes like a tongue depressor.  I have a sensitive gag reflex and the taste triggers a reaction.  Minus the taste I would consider the product an average toothbrush that is a decent alternative to plastic products.

This toothbrush was great for about 4 days. Then it became rough and irritating on my lips. I’m going back to using a brush with plastic handle.

The toothbrush is well built and fits nicely in the hand. It takes time to get used to the different taste and feel of the bamboo being in your mouth. I might brush my teeth too hard, but I did notice irritation on my upper lip from rubbing against the grain of the bamboo. The bristles are not packed tightly enough in my opinion and do no offer full coverage. I’ve also found that the bristles are very irritating to my gums.

I really liked these toothbrushes and it didn't take long to get used to them, but after about 2 months (I replace mine every 3 months) the bristles completely came off the brush inside my mouth.  Not a great feeling :(  This happened not once, but TWICE.  I'm on my third toothbrush and we'll see what happens this time but I will probably shop for another bamboo brand.

These feel too soft for us. like they aren't scrubbing enough to make your mouth feel clean

The first time i used the Toothbrush one of the hairs came off and the toothbrush overall looked great but after using it for 4 days i noticed that my teeth would hurt after each use, after checking it out today i noticed i had small cuts on my gums! I dont know if im using it too hard or not but its cutting my gums which is unfortunate :c

These are okay but not great. The bristles were a little soft for my preference and while the bamboo is smooth it could use a little wax because it can make the corners of your mouth a little raw if you aren't careful. I would say a little wax coating might go a long way toward making this feel a little more like a typical toothbrush. A decent brush with some room for improvement.

I like these. They work just fine for me, but the first time my boyfriend tried to brush his teeth with one, it snapped in half while in his mouth. I suspect it was more his fault for brushing his teeth with too much force.

Love the appearance and value for a sustainable product. However, in a couple of the brushes, the bristles would come off and I would have to spit them out or floss out

Rough on my gums. Last box I bought did not do this.

I have been using bamboo charcoal toothbrushes for the past year and really like them.This the first time trying this brand.The package comes with 12 toothbrushes that are individually boxed in pairs of two, one regular and one charcoal.Pros:• the bristles are a good quality.• no plastic! Which never goes away, it just breaks down into smaller pieces and harms everyone.• smaller head reaches all of the tight spots.Cons:• the charcoal brushes that are included have less charcoal than the other brand that I use. Not sure how effective these are. I gave 4 stars for this.I do recommend these and hope we eliminate plastic toothbrushes :))I also use these as amenities in our short-term rentals/airbnbs.

They feel amazing on my teeth and sensitive gums but I think they could use more sanding of something bc little splinters of wood have come off and it’s scary because you can get a splinter in the motion of brushing your teeth!

I don't think they are recycable, because the actual brush fibers seem to be plastic, but they go where larger or wider toothbrushes won't.  I change mine out about everything 4 months.  The charcoal colored ones produce the same result as the white.

You get so many toothbrushes for the price!  I’m still getting used to the feel of the bamboo handle in my mouth rather than smooth plastic.  It’s not bad, just different.  I’ve yet to see my dentist since I started using them, so curious what he will say about the bristles- they seem effective in getting my teeth clean to me.  For the money tgey ate definitely worth trying.

My family loves these except for some of the bristles tend to come out on occasion.

Having dental implants put in. Temps in now. Needed something soft. works great

I like these tooth brushes and have been buying them for me and my partner. They are exactly as described but they do occasionally irritate the corner of your mouth because they are made from wood, otherwise it's as good as any other brush on the market.

I bought these because I was going to try and be good to the environment. You're supposed to replace your toothbrush every 3 months and just throwing away plastic toothbrushes isn't ideal, so I bought these. Right away I didn't like them. The head was just a bit too big for my mouth and it made the whole experience uncomfortable. I think I lasted a week using these before I just got an electric toothbrush. So, yeah they might be good for the environment but not for my oral hygiene.

The quality of the toothbrush is great, the Bristles are little rough on the gums, but after a while your gums get used to it and it is no longer a problem.

I like that they’re soft bristles and made of bamboo but I’m not really a fan of the feel of bamboo wood on my lips

These are so much better than regular brushes when it comes to environmental health but they do not give you a deep clean.

- its wood head is too large at least for me to get into nooks and crannies as in another reviewSo i decided to make the part smaller with an angle grinder.Anyway, I like its brush.

1st off. This isn't all plastic.! These brushes are the closest to natural that I have come across.Problem is they come rather large for my mouth. Easily remedied with some sandpaper and/or a file.Rounding of the sharp cut edges removes most of the large uncomfortableness of the large to my mouth design.

As a family of 5, larger packs are always appreciated. We have now bought these brushes a second time and are beyond pleased with them as a whole. No issues reaching into the tightest of spaces in our mouths. The bristles are just the right amount of softness, so no irritation on some of our sensitive gums and teeth. The best part is we can snap off the handle (if I don't use them to clean with) and either use then somewhere repurposed or compost them! 💚💙

I like these toothbrushes. They were the look I wanted and they are nice and soft. However I wish the Brussels were a tad shorter.

Brushing my teeth

I truly like these. A super good value. Even my granddaughter loved it.

Love everything about these toothbrushes. They hold up and will last me a year of good use at least. Love the bamboo and charcoal bristles. Not too soft, not to hard. Perfect. I will order again.UPDATE FOR MY ORDER JANUARY 2023 - Had to return. Seller please update the description. It reads: "Biodegradable Eco-Friendly Natural Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrushes - 12 Count" Not true. I was promised 12 charcoal toothbrushes, I received only 6 brushes and three were not charcoal! Every time I have ordered before, I got four charcoal brushes for a lot less money than this six pack of only 3 charcoal brushes. I didn't order "white" plain brushes according to the product description that reads 12 charcoal toothbrushes. I see only NOW that the photo that is very small is showing some white, but the title does not say that. I love the charcoal brushes and have ordered several times over the years, but am disappointed with this order. Thank you.

It molds easily if not properly dried, but otherwise it's pretty good! No splinters!

I really like these, the bristles are really soft and I'm glad to not be adding nasty plastic to the landfills and contributing to the destruction of our beautiful Earth. However it takes some getting used to, having the feeling of bamboo wood on your tongue and sides of your cheek. But it's a great alternative. I think maybe the product could be improved a little bit by having a slightly slimmer head, a tongue scraper would be a nice addition also. Other than that I think it's pretty great. To avoid bamboo slivers I try to dry off or at least flip the toothbrush a little bit to get most of the water off after I use it for brushing. I wouldn't keep these in the shower, the constant water/humidity might cause the wood grains to raise and get a sliver.

This product is really great, it took a little bit of getting used to as an alternative to normal plastic toothbrushes; the feeling on the inside of your cheek is a little off-putting at first but you grow accustomed to it. The bristles have fallen out of two of the brushes in approximately a 6 month span and they get a white stain on the wood from the toothpaste. Other than that they are very soft bristles and work great and make you feel much better about your impact on the environment.

Great quality.Very soft.The head is quite large so that is taking some getting used to. I think adjusting to the size is worth the benefits. I will look for a smaller one next time.

Ive been in the market for more sustainable hygiene products and was in the need to toothbrushes. I decided on these in particular bc I felt the price was good. But this is mind you the first type of bamboo toothbrushes I try out. I was a little disappointed on how they felt when I used them. The plus is that they are light-wieight and it was good packaging, straight to the point, but they felt too soft (not necessarily the bristles but the brush as a whole didn’t feel very sturdy). Also, I experienced some shedding in the first and second try of using the toothbrushes. Other than that it feels like an okay purchase. I don’t want to say I won’t buy again, but I will be looking into other brands of bamboo toothbrushes once I finish using these. These get the job done with cleaning your teeth but other than that the over all experience was just okay.

I do like these toothbrushes. The only thing I didn't like was if it gets wet and stays wet, mold will rapidly form on the handle of the toothbrush. And once mold forms, there's no going back. It must be thrown away. I find that laying this toothbrush across a cup allows it to dry out faster. I don't recommend keeping these toothbrushes in travel toothbrush holders because mold will come. I don't recommend them for traveling purposes.

The bristles are not soft from the start - they’re just about as hard as regular toothbrushes but they soften within a week or two of use.I’m not sure how well it whitens since I don’t pay attention to that really, but my one complaint is that one or two bristles come out while brushing every once in a while!Otherwise, for the number of brushes you get, I’d say it’s decent.

Eco-friendly people unite! These brushes are a perfect first step to cutting down on non-recyclable plastic. Even the box and the dyes in the box are biodegradable! The bristles are soft and seem to do a good job at getting all the plaque off of my teeth. Also these are super affordable for 4 of them!Downsides are that the feeling of the bamboo takes some getting used to. It’s not the same smoothness you’re expecting with a plastic toothbrush. Another one is that the bamboo sometimes has ‘splinters’ where a little bit of the wood sticks up due to it swelling. This can be kind of uncomfortable but if you find the splitter and tear it off/sand it down with a nail file you should be fine.

I guess I wasn’t reading the description carefully enough because I was expecting all of the toothbrushes in the set to have charcoal bristles. I would have selected a different product if I realized.

They’re fine, they work, they’re soft, good value

Wish that the bristles were a  bit more sturdier. But all in all a good buy.

I've been using the black bristle toothbrushes for ever and they're great! This was my first time trying the ones with white bristles and they hurt my gums. I'm not sure if they're just not as soft as the black but they hurt so bad I can't use them.

my daughter uses these toothbrushes, and seems to like them, as she asked me to order more. the only flaw we see is that the tip of the handle turns green as it stands in the toothbrush jar that we stand our toothbrushes in. i use a plastic coated toothbrush still and i do not have this issue with my toothbrush. it's not a big deal because i'm confident it's just because it's natural wood/bamboo and probably does so because it gets wet, and she isn't putting that part of the toothbrush in her mouth anyway. but you asked for feedback and that is the only thing we've noticed that we would like to not see.

This was my very first bamboo toothbrush and I’ve been using it for about 7 weeks. So far I like it. No weird taste, no splinters and I haven’t had any bristles fall out either. After use I make sure to compress the handle with a towel and let it dry on my bathroom storage display to avoid molding. My only issue is that the bristles are almost too soft that I’ve found I have to brush harder and longer to get my teeth to feel as clean as they were with a regular plastic toothbrush. I’m still going to finish the pack so I don’t waste it but maybe I’ll try another brand with stronger bristles next time

Its great for the environment but god no did it not whiten my teeth even a little. Also if youve got a small mouth be warned it is a massive brush head. I worried id get a mouth splinter (never did). I used them and was happy with them but god dont travel with them! They need to be cared for very differently than normal tooth brushes. You need to let the tooth brush completely dry so you have to have it out and can not store it in a cabinet or travel bag without the worry of mold and such (with most tooth brushes you should be concerned as well)

The materials are fine, possibly waxing the wood (and providing a textured handle for grip) might be good to avoid mold and/or wood disintegration. The bristles are good - not too soft, not too firm. The biggest improvement needs to be in the overall design. I'd like to see a modern, ergonomic design i.e. angled handle, wider diamond shaped head, multi-level bristles, to compete with modern plastic brushes. Also, although the product and product packaging itself is plastic free, Amazon shipped it in a plastic bubble pack, so it sort of defeats the purpose. Hopefully Amazon can rectify this in the future, otherwise I might look into ordering direct from the manufacturer.

I really liked these toothbrushes. The bamboo was a lot smoother than I expected. I thought they would get all gross after multiple uses but the material holds up very well. The one thing I will say is that the bristles are SUPER soft. It's not so noticeable when you are brushing your teeth but when you brush your tongue, it is soo ticklish. Just be aware of that. overall it has a cleaner feel than plastic toothbrushes and I even think I've noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. the only thing that would make this product even better is a non-plastic alternative for a toothbrush cap!

If you haven't used a bamboo toothbrush before, be warned it's an odd thing to get used to. The feeling of wood on the tongue brings to mind dentist appointments and can make you gag. Nevertheless, it's a small sacrifice to get used to the feel of something different when it helps to cut back on plastic litter. The brushes work just fine, and they look cool. The bristles don't seem to wear as bad as regular toothbrushes, either. You do have to keep them dry though, and may want a freestanding toothbrush holder as opposed to a cup. They will get mildewy if they stay wet. All in all, I'll buy again!

I try to do my best in being environmentally friendly, so when I found out bamboo toothbrushes existed, I thought I'd give them a try.  They don't splinter or scrape your mouth, which is nice.  If you have multiple people using these toothbrushes, there are numbers on them so you can know whose is whose.  I'm not sure if that's their purpose, but that's how I use that feature.The rows of bristles are a little more narrow than most toothbrushes, but you get used to it.  It doesn't hinder performance.

Brushes are sturdy and sustainable, but the bristles are a little hard and chafe my gums. Unless I am very careful in avoiding my gums, which really isn't a good idea or possible, I tend to have a sore mouth after brushing. The good news is that it doesn't hurt for very long, but the soreness may come back if you eat certain foods. I would say it's great to be sustainable with these brushes, but a softer alternative would really help.

Gave it 3 stars because there was a duplicate number brush which becomes a hassle in a family of four. I just took a sharpie and put a dot on the bottom of the number as a solution. Nonetheless, this seems to be a common issue as well. Something that could easily be avoided if not lazy. Reason for 3 stars and not 4, it seems like an issue being ignored by the company and I get the feeling as long as they get that 4th star it’s ok.

Nice wooden light weight toothbrush. Very soft bristles. Small bristles though. I find myself brushing my teeth for a longer more thorough cleaning with this since it's so small. Makes reaching around the mouth more difficult since the wooden handles are flat and straight. Wish there was some type of bends in it, but it's wood. Wish the bristles were a bit more rigid. All in all I'd buy these again but know you're sacrificing quality of teeth brushing to justify doing your part environmentally.

I ordered these as I liked the idea of them being compostable and earth friendly. I am getting used to the feel of wood in my mouth rather than plastic.  The bristles are firm enough to get the job done.  The handle is straight and would probably been a better choice to get one more similar to the plastic tooth brushes. I would buy these again even with the straight handle.

I like the feel of the brushes and the fact that I am not adding more plastic to my waste. For me, I would prefer the bristles to be a little harder for the difficult cracks between teeth and to help clean my permanent retainer. Otherwise, this toothbrush has held up well for 2 months. No bristles came off. No splinters. The handle is smooth and doesn't bother me. I typically have texture issues with wood, cotton, and paper. No problems here. I would gladly order again in a slightly tougher bristle.

I enjoy using this brush! It’s so soft on the gums and feels like a cleaner experienced. My only issue is the wood on the head of the brush protrudes a little too much and hits the back of my mouth when brushing. I also noticed after a week that I got a scab on the corner of my mouth and then realized it’s from the brush. I think it needed paint on that part of the brush, I had to put some nail polish to seal it.

So far so great. I’m not an expert in toothbrushes but they seem to work like a regular plastic one. Packaging was new and neat. The bristles don’t come out even if you pull at them. The only reason I give 4 stars is because of the smell. It’s not like a chemical smell or anything just bamboo. I guess that’s a good thing since that means they’re real. But anyway once your hold the brushes it kind of stays on your hands so just wash them with some soap and you’ll be fine

To start, love that they are numbered! They do the job and have lasted a long time without the bristles getting soft or frayed. Docking 1 star because it’s a bit rough on the gums and can leave my teeth feeling sore and sometimes bloody. With that said, it DOES get into the gums and crevices quite well so that can be viewed as a bonus by some. Will buy again most likely.

I love that the packaging was 100% plastic free, really made me feel good about the purchase.  The toothbrush took a little getting used to after having used 'standard' plastic brushes all my life, but the bristles are soft, and once I got the hang of holding it, it's actually very ergonomic too.  I did have a few bristles come out the first time I used it, which was a little gross, but after that it's been fine.

Did you know any brand can say they use “biodegradable” products? There is no regulation of what products can be labeled with that word. However, bamboo is a plant and breaks down in landfills super quickly compared to man made composite materials like plastic. These toothbrushes are smooth and long-lasting and we buy them every time we need more or have guests over.

best feeling on the teeth! never do plastic again if I can help it.

The black bristles are softer than the white ones, but they are both great for sensitive teeth. I have been purchasing these for years now and I’ve left the plastic ones behind.

Love! Soft and doesn’t get stuck in braces when brushing.

I am so glad I made the switch from plastic toothbrushes. These work just as well if not better. I appreciate not having the trash guilt when I’m ready to swap out my brush.

I really love the toothbrush that is made out of everything being said on the package it didn't feel any effect on my gums and it feels very smooth and comfortable to brush

These are so soft. When it’s time to change out for a new one - I use them as cleaning brushes. They don’t last as long as plastic bristles. But not sure if people change out their brushes like they should. These are much better than brushing your teeth with plastic!!

I use this brand currently so I already know that it’s good quality, but I’ve never bought this specific product and I’m glad I wasn’t disappointed. The package came nicely without damage and each box of two toothbrushes is individually packaged in this larger box, which makes it perfect for travel.

I hate hate hate having to buy new toothbrushes when I know the one I was using will still be here when I’m long dead and gone. These make me feel way less guilty. Especially cause apparently you’re supposed to change your brush every three months cause bacteria? Idk.If you keep your toothbrushes in a cup tho, it will get moldy at the ends after about 2-3 months. I’ve read that you just need to let it dry before putting it in the cup. Or just keep it in something that is exposed to the air so it can dry. I don’t know tho cause I haven’t done that yet tho cause I’m forgetful. But I haven’t gotten sick from it or anything yet! Loll. It’s never gone past about an inch from the bottom so.You probably think I’m crazy for that but whatever.Anyway the bristles are soft and don’t fall out or anything weird. They’re good brushes :)

I use these in my Airbnb , each box contains two 2 toothbrushes, nice quality, I use them myself when traveling.

Great buy  I love them

I love these toothbrushes and have purchased them several times. I've been trying to make sustainable changes around the house, and this was an easy change for my family to make. I believe that the quality of these toothbrushes are the reason why the switch was so easy.Things we love about these toothbrushes:- the quality of the bamboo: we haven't had any splinters and the bamboo is durable- soft bristles- the numbered handles: this is especially important when multiple people share the same bathroom.I don't see any benefit to using the toothbrushes with charcoal bristles, but that doesn't really bother me.

I made the switch to bamboo toothbrushes several years ago in an attempt to move on from yet another plastic disposable item in my household. I also needed to step down to "Soft" grade toothbrushes because of my tendency to press too hard when brushing, resulting in gum recession.As with any product professing to be 'green', there's a genuine concern of 'greenwashing' that isn't helped by any clear, third party affirmation of the sustainable efficacy of Isshah's product line. That said, the toothbrush is certainly made out of wood and charcoal, and it lasts about as long as my previous, plastic options. I have not noticed any substantive change in the quality of the brushing result, aside from the desired decrease in the amount of damage I was doing to my gums with a "Medium" level brush. My dentist continues to compliment me on my teeth care, for what it's worth.The brush head is a bit wide, which makes it a tight fit in travel containers. Not a deal breaker, but being stored in such a container for a week's worth of travel will permanently bend the bristles.

Works like a toothbrush should. Easy to hold soft bristles as described.

Great

Love these.  My gums have never looked so pinkThey come 2 to a little box with one having dark brown bristles the other in natural bristles. little boxes fit into the larger box.I started giving the little box of 2 to friends so they could enjoy them also.

These are my favorite style of brushes. They are hard to find in stores in my area unless you get lucky at a discount store or something similar but I do not often visit those. I love that I can buy them online in such a large pack because it will last me a full year.

We have used this brand several times.  No issues with splinters and works very well.  We typically replace toothbrushes monthly.  Glad to have an economical, eco-friendly solution for toothbrushes.

It really cleans well.I am a former extra firm toobrush user for many years. I am extremely impressed with this bamboo bristles toothbrushes. They are flexible yet sturdy.Good for every "taste" in bristle firmness.I am a convert! .This is my 3rd order. They clean as well as extra firm toothbrushes without the harshness....Give this a try and see for yourself !

After reading reviews that mentioned weird mouth feel, pleasantly surprised to find we don't mind the wood handles 1 iota! Smooth wet or dry (no splinters) and easy to grip even for someone who's had a stroke (moi)  We felt they clean teeth beautifully, just as efficiently as an Oral B.Trying to minimize plastics - genuinely pleased w. these bamboo toothbrushes. Would recommend and will purchase again, though it may be a while as you get 12 of these for a very reasonable price. Very happy w. this product!

I loved them. They are soft and they last awhile too.

I used an electric toothbrush for a long time until it broke, then I bought these. At my visit to the dentist this  month the dental hygienist said, You're doing a much better job brushing. Everything looks so good.And I put it all down to these brushes. They brush the teeth and also act a bit like flossing. I've never had any of the problems that other reviewers have had. Indeed, a great toothbrush.

I really like the size of the brush head. It's not too big and the bristles are soft enough to not irritate my gums, yet do a fantastic job cleaning teeth. I bought them because the handles are made from bamboo which is known to resist bacteria and is biodegradable which is important to me.

Love the whole idea of a bamboo toothbrush.  I'm not adding plastic to the landfill and they are very resonably priced

Good quality toothbrushes

I actually love these toothbrushes. The bristles appear to be much softer than the plastic toothbrushes but they clean so well and feel so good. I think it's because the bristles are cut unevenly so they really get in between teeth, not just the surface. My teeth are very close , it's hard to floss and I still have all my wisdom teeth so I have to go pretty far back into my mouth to clean them all properly. I usually have to brush harder or brush over my teeth so many times to get the "slick clean feel" I like, especially in the back. These I don't have to and they're so soft so I was surprised they cleaned that well and quickly. I also usually have a little bit of blood because of the vigorous cleaning I have to do in the back but I have absolutely no bleeding no matter how long I brush with these toothbrushes. These are great.

The quality is great

Great

There brushes are a-lot better than I expected.I bought them to have inexpensive toothbrushes around the house for sleep overs.The last time I used a wooden toothbrush it felt awkward and the bristles were not that great.These brushes are well balanced in the hand and feel comfortable to use. They reach and work all the areas of my mouth comfortably and the bristles work well.I’ve only been using one of these brushes for a week now but the brush seems like it will hold up well and last as long as any other toothbrush.

I really like this toothbrush as the bristles are truly soft

I love that I’m helping the environment, With these bamboo toothbrushes

So many toothbrushes for a low price! I bought this twice so far. The toothbrushes have soft bristles and I like that they are numbered and have a black/white option so that you don't get them mixed up with people in your household. I always have a spare for guests and I like that I can swap them out frequently without spending so much.

I bought these toothbrushes a while back as a way of reducing my waste. I was really unsure what to expect but was very excited because of how affordable they were and we all know how expensive trying to go more waste free can be. When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the bamboo was and how soft the bristles were. I didn't use them right away, as I had some other toothbrushes I was trying to get through first as to not waste them. I have been using the first brush regularly now for about two weeks and I absolutely love it.After about a week and a half, some of the bristles popped out of one of the clusters and it sort of made me cringe a little because it was unexpected. But once I realized what was going on and the whole toothbrush wasn't falling apart, it didn't bother me much. A small price to pay for something more eco-friendly. My boyfriend isn't much of a fan of the bamboo against his cheek and I agree, it's a little hard to get used to. But once you do, it's no problem at all. My teeth feel clean, the toothbrushes are comfortable and soft to use, and they are something I will definitely continue to purchase.They even have little engraved numbers on them so you can keep track of which toothbrush is yours! :)

I have been looking for a soft toothbrush and I ran into this bamboo one that I absolutely love. Its bristles are soft enough yet brush away any debris from my teeth. I recommend it

Good as advertised

These toothbrushes all have bristles in varying sizes and some falling out.  Every single one of them is useless.  I threw my old toothbrush away thinking I would get one of these out in the morning and had to resurrect my old one out of the trash to be able to brush my teeth.  I had bristles falling out of the brush in my mouth.  Very dangerous if I had swallowed any.I tried to upload a photo but for some reason the photo would not load up.I am really angry that I wasted money that I have to budget every month to the penny.  I will never buy these again on Amazon.  Every one needs to be thrown in the trash which is exactly the opposite of why I bought them.Don't waste your money.

Why wouldn't you buy? I have been using for a few years now and they are good for the planet and clean teeth I think better

I’m really trying to go plastic free in my life and these bamboo toothbrushes fit the bill. . I don’t feel guilty about tossing these, knowing that they’re a little better for the environment. They do a great job of cleaning your teeth too!

this is my first time trying bamboo toothbrushes. at first, they hurt my gums after brushing. felt like it was cutting my gums but after using for a month, it does'nt feel like this anymore.it never hurt my husbands gums though. it is a little more difficult getting use to brushiing the very back teeth and seems more dificult than the standard toothbrush..i would reccommend these and would buy them again!

The bristles are soft, comfortable in the hand and clean well.  So far (three uses) I'm pleased with the results - and still have nine more to use.  No loose bristles so far.  This gives me another opportunity to save the environment.

I have been buying these for a while now.  The bristles used to come out in your mouth quite a bit.  They seem to have fixed that issue.  I really like the bamboo and soft bristles.  No hard plastics in my mouth, thank you.  Recommended.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these... I wanted a nicer looking toothbrush than the gaudy bright toothbrushes on the market. This one takes a little getting used to. The angular wooden form is much different than I was used to. The bristles are perfect for cleaning teeth. The handle  and tip feels like it might damage gums because of the flat wooden form, but not happened. After about 2 weeks, I am finding that I prefer it to the other brands. The Bristles are holding up very well as an aggressive brusher. I plan to continue using these

Hairbrush looks nice but wasn’t functional for my hair. Caused more tangles than it did brush through them. I pulled out soo much hair using the brush. Switched to a wet brush and it takes 5x less time to brush all the knots out of my hair. Wouldn’t buy this again

Useless It looks attractive & THATS IT!!! USELESS on Wet OR Dry hair!!

I bough this for my daughter mid February and by March bristle started falling. Her hair also started falling.

First off I tried to peel off the sticker very carefully but it still left behind residue that I’m going to have to waste time getting off because what’s the sense of having a nice design on the brush if it’s just going to have sticker residue on it? I don’t get why you put a sticker on a wooden product to begin with. I don’t like the way the bristles feel on my head whenever I brush my hair, I feel like this was a waste of money unfortunately and will be searching for a different brush.

This brush is a nightmare it rips out our hair!!

Brustles are too short.

Honestly it’s just a regular brush, and best suited for straight hair ppl.

There were missing wooden type brisles some were cracked

broke with a monthI lost needles and it pulls your hair dont believe the reviews

I have 0 clue how this brush has so many great reviews. I ordered it with high hopes since I have long curly tangled hair.When I tell you this was by far the worst experience of my life … I am not exaggerating. This brush literally YANKED my hair right out. I lost SO much hair I literally started crying. I am in awe. I don’t know if it’s because the Bristles are so thick that it won’t detangle my curly hair or what … but this was crazy. My scalp is throbbing as I write this.

I like the look of this brush.  However the bristles have been popping out one by one. They're not very secure in the brush. I am able to reattach some of them but had thrown a few out before I realized that. As time went on more and more bristles kept popping out while brushing my hair. It's a pain to put them back in. And they just pop back out. This brush looks functional but in the end is a waste of money. I'm throwing it in the trash.

I just got the brush it does look sturdy  but this is the first time I use it, and one of the tooth already broke off

After three weeks of having this brush, almost all of the bristles started falling out, and it could not be stopped. It could not put up with the thickness of my hair. Do not buy if you have hair that has tangles!

Poorly made....bristles falling out. Handle is nice though.

If you have thick hair that is prone to tangles, this is not the brush for you. It is a beautiful brush and I appreciate the fact it is eco friendly but It is so painful to brush your hair with and it rips my hair out.

Not even sure what made me buy this product but it did not work for me. I have thin, straight, long hair. This did not help with tangles and if I used it while my hair was dry it would static all over the place.

It’s terrible. Not at all like original brush. It rips at hair and made split ends through out hair. It came in a box that had been wet and had mold inside. I tried to communicate with seller and had no response. Do not waste your money. Too bad since the original was great and lasted 10 years. Obviously a different manufacturer now.

This brush is awful. I have very long, straight, silky hair and this brush knotted my hair from the first stroke. Left my hair horribly staticky, too. Will be returning.

I just got this brush, I've had it maybe 2 hours. When I got out the shower and started to brush my hair on second stroke, bristles started to fly out of the brush hitting the mirror and landing on the sink counter. I have straight and thin hair, usually a brush goes through no problem. I don't know if the one I got was defective, but it's definitely starting to fall apart. I had to just use my old brush.

It would be a great product if the pad that holds the bristles stayed attached to the handle.  It just pops right off when it meets the slightest resistance in my hair,  and in order to keep using it I have to clamp the pad to the handle with my hand and hold on while I brush.  I love the bristles and they are very gentle on my hair, but it's impossible to use this brush!

I have 4b-4c hair that I straighten and this brush yanks my hair out. It feels like my hair is ripping out with every stroke. I don’t recommend this for courser hair textures, even when straightened. I believe it’s because if the balls on the ends of the bristles.

I have naturally fine, curly hair that I blow-dry straight while brushing. This brush snagged my hair with every swipe, putting more snarls and tangle in than I started with. I kept having to pull it (painfully) from my hair, then carefully undo the tangle.

The bristles are so short they barely get through my very thin hair.

It doesn't make the hair frizzy, but it tears your hair like crazy! I'm not going to return it but definitely I will not use it anymore.

I used this brush as soon as I got it. I have thin hair and it ripped many hairs out. My hair was not tangled, it just ripped out many hairs. Returned it right away.

This was rough brushing my dry hair, but after I got out of the shower and brushed my wet hair with it, it immediately got stuck, stretched my hair and been lost a bristle. Definitely returning.

It’s been one week and already missing bristles.

Worst hairbrush we have ever owned.  We used the brush exactly 2 times and 3 bristles already broke off.  For the price I expected these to be better quality.  If you have thicker hair this is not for you and it is cheaply made.

If you have thick hair or long hair, it will tangle bad doesn't work well and is made of poor quality.

The company seems to be great but unfortunately I don't recommend the brush I bought . I'm seriously thinking of throwing this brush in the trash . Everytime I use it I have issues with it falling apart. Maybe it just the brush I have is defective but the truth my hurt but just being honest .

Why would you put a paper sticker on the product itself? Now I have to get the goo-gone out and scrub, which will surely ruin the wood. Packaging was impossible to open, kitschy design plus the sticker ripping was enough to make me throw it away.

This is the worst brush ever for long, fine hair. I've used it for a week now and it's breaking my hair and doesn't detangle AT ALL!It does feel good on the scalp and it's probably great if you have short, thick hair.

It does not brush through hair. The bristles move away from your head so it just smooths the surface. It made the top of my hair staticky and did not get the tangles under the top layer. It was useless as a brush. I ended up returning it.

Threw the brush out after 3 months of having it and using it maybe 20-30 times. All the bristles are almost gone, pulls at my hair like crazy to the point where it hurts. Very disappointing

This brush sucks. The bristles are flimsy and doesn’t work on wet hair

The brush is beautiful but smelled heavily like rubber... I tried it twice both times it ripped my hair out.. even after combing my hair with conditioner and a comb just before. This brush even if my hair has no knots still rips my hair out. I do not reccomend it to actually brush your hair with.

Not sure why they put a poor quality sticker on the nicest part of the brush. Now I don’t want to use it. I tried scrubbing it off with dish soap but no help.

I have never had a problem with using any hairbrush like I’ve had with this one. Every time I brushed my hair I felt like it was ripping hair out of my head. I have fine hair and there is no reason for a brush to hurt as much as this one did!

Omg I bought it after readying that wooden brushes are better for healthier hair and restoring hair growth. Well that was a lie with this product, it legit pulls my hair and gets stuck. I would definitely not recommend this brand. I also haven’t tried others but imma just stick to my everyday plastic hair brush for now.

Don’t buy if you have thin hair. Big Comb pulls on hair, my girls didn’t like it. Will buy the smaller comb separately.

Hair brush is pretty cheap. I mean it's a brush, but I wouldn't have paid 9$ for it when I could have gotten a better one at the dollar store had I known the quality. Wood is very flimsy and it came cracked, and it's missing some of the bristles in the brush.

doesn’t even remove knots. not at all flexible at bristles, literally the worst brush i’ve ever used.

Hate this brush! The bristles are way too hard...can't even use it.

Doesn’t go through my hair

I liked this brush until after a few uses. The pad of bristles disconnected from the wooden brush. I had to use superglue to make it stick. It worked for about a month but then it disconnected from the brush again. Not for people with thick or long hair.

Wanted to love this based on reviews and a google search.  Unfortunately didn’t work for my fine, thin hair and pulled out more hair than my old brush and have to return.  It’s too bad as got at a great price.

Bought this a month ago was supposed to be a good brush for thick hair this brush is not and highly disappointed

Looks very nice in pictures but quality is pretty bad. Doesn’t detangle at all. Hair gets stuck at the ends. It hurts when combing and pieces fall out of the brush so bad! Do not recommend.

I SO wanted to be happy with this brush. Not a month after purchasing half the bristles have fallen out. I have fine, thin hair, so I can't even imagine if you bought with thick or curly hair.

I bought 2 of these brushes. One for my house and one for my boyfriend’s house. The blue one is fine. It is not as good as my agave bamboo paddle brush, but it didn’t cost 30$ either. The pink is crap. The pad the bristles are on is too soft and so it pushes in and the bristles cannot get through my thick hair. I’ll stick it in my sons’ bathroom for when they visit. Maybe it will be fine on their shorter hair. I’ll be spending the money on another agave brush now. You really do get what you pay for

I never leave reviews but I was so frustrated with this brush I couldn't help but not! It looks so nice and I love the wooden backing and handle. The "cushion" in the middle comes in different colors and I really liked that option. However, if you are looking for a brush that gives you a pleasant hair experience this is not it. It does not go through tangles very well and makes the brushing process painful. Would not recommend.

The brush looks lovely and appears to be well-made. Because the bristles are bamboo, they are separate pins inserted into the cushion. The brush is large but feels comfortable in my hand. The bamboo bristles have rounded tips, appear to have some sort of sealant and are comfortable against my scalp.I have long, fine, slightly wavy hair but a lot of it. I tested this brush on fully dried hair. The problem is that when I use this brush, my hair gets caught in the gap between the rubber cushion and the bottom of the pin which causes some hair to pull out from my scalp. Because I have so much hair, I think it tugs more on the bristles which cause the gap. To check, I ran my fingers across the bristles and can see how this gap occurs.Even when I detangle my hair first with another brush and then use this brush starting from the bottom of the strands and working my way up, my hair still gets caught and pulls out. It also seems to get tangled at times by this brush. The strands that get caught and pulled from my scalp hurts more than when I use any other brush I own, even for heavy detangling.This brush did not work for my hair so I will be returning it. It may work for others with shorter hair or a different hair type.

Brush was purchased to replace two Paul Mitchell paddle brushes owned for almost 20 years that finally started cracking.  Zero "pins" ever fell out of those brushes.  These began falling out after 3 months, and continue to fall out every few weeks.  The ones we find we put back in, and they just fall out again.  Low quality item.  Won't be buying again any time soon.

This is a nice looking brush if you want to gently work out some light tangles, but it doesn't work well for styling, blow drying, or getting serious about brushing out your hair.  I have long hair, medium thickness, with some natural wave. I am used to putting my hair up in a pony, bun or claw clip, French braiding it, and blow drying it with the help of a paddle brush. The reason this brush doesn't work is that the bristles are a little too short, and a little too far in from the edge of the paddle, to get the job done. The edge of the paddle is the thing making contact with your head, not the bristles. When I tried to blow dry with this brush, my hair blew right off the brush and it was useless. The handle is also so smooth/slippery it's harder to manage than what I'm used to. I will go back to my pink plastic drug store paddle brush.

Y'all have to be lying about having thick hair. I actually have thick hair. It just gets straight up stuck in my hair when wet. I have shoulder length hair too lmao. It works worse than my $2 brush from the dollar store man.

I purchased hoping to stir my hairs regrowth.  Didn't work, seemed to get thinner.  But the brush works well in the hair and on the scalp.  My hair looked nice after I brushed it, but my balding spot seemed to be getting larger so I went back to my Pick.  Still, very good product.

I think I can finally explain why the other reviewers have noticed that this brush pulls your hair. I took a super up close photo of the wooden tines of the brush. As you can see, they are not smooth. Some have little splinters. Some have sharp edges. Yet, the real problem is that each one has a little knob at the base that is extremely rough. Also it’s not sealed to the pad of the brush. So your hair gets trapped under the base of each tine. Then, when you pull the brush through your hair, it pulls your hair out. Now if you have really short hair this is not gonna be a big deal. However, if you have long hair, this brush is gonna pull a few hairs out every time you use it.

I have tried to like this brush. First, let’s start with the positives: it is a very sturdy brush. It’s big, and I  love that it is wooden. Cons: brushing with this brush hurts my head so, so, so bad. I am Not a sensitive head at all, but it HURTS. And, it doesn’t get all my tangled out. I ended up purchasing another ol faithful wet brush. Will be donating this one.

While this is a beautiful brush, it is not a good option for individuals with curly hair or hair that tangles easily.I have a mixture of 2c and 3a curls and my hair tends to get pretty tangled. So tangled that 3 bristles from the brush ripped out while trying to detangle my hair. My hair regularly gets caught on the bristle where the rounded tip and straight base meet.I've used this brush on both wet and dry hair. While the issue is worse on wet hair, I still have the same problem when my hair is dry.

The moment I got it I used it on my son who's got really thick hair and is impossible to brush this brush was amazing with his hair I'm so glad I got it I can't wait to use it in my own hair plus I got a headband and a comb to go with it I love itUpdate NovemberThis brush has been amazing has not stopped working and hasn't broken and hasn't fallen apart this brush was well-made usually brushes in our house don't last long especially since all of us have long hair and they become really terrible to use but this brush has with stand all of the brushing that we do with our hairs thank you to the makers of this brush  I will be buying two more so we don't all have to fight over one brush haha 😆 😆Update 4/26/022I love the brush I had bought this in June of last year but very sad it didn't last a year the brisel started to come off and then the whole thing came off of the wood part.

I bought this with the notion that it was better for my hair. However upon first use I realized I could be wrong. I have hair past my waist and it's fairly thin so it gets tangled very easily.  I noticed that instead of working through the tangles it snags and pulls. If you have knots, this brush will straight up pull the whole thing out. It doesnt work well with wet hair or at least for me it didnt. Again pulls and snags the hair even if you split the hair in sections. I had more tangles on the left side of my head than I did on the right one night. I used this brush to get them out and now the left side of my scalp has been sore for about a day now. It works well as a touch up brush. The only good thing that I have found with it is it is simple to hold, the rat tail comb makes it simple to clean and the design is pretty. That's it. Do I recommend? Unfortunately, no

It did not brush through my wavy wet conditioned hair. In fact it ripped it out and caused more tangles and damage. Do not recommend for wavy, long, hair.

I recently purchased this brush and I’m honestly not really impressed with it. It just works like a normal brush and does it’s job I guess. However, the brush came with a stupid sticker on top that I had to slowly pick at. It left this sticky white residue and I don’t want to use goo gone because it’s bamboo…. So besides that inconvenience the brush is just average.

Cute brush set, but not well made. The first time I tryed to brush my hair with it the middle popped out

It's already missing a tooth when i opened it so not sure if its gonna hold up good or not😕

Just not a good 'everyday' brush for either me or my daughter : she has very thick textured hair and I have super thin soft hair...

Pros: Looks great and the material does not rot even after using it in the shower.Cons: unless you have 10 inch nails forget about taking the hair out of them. I use tweezers instead.You be the judge, but it is not practical to spend 10 minutes trying to get the hair out of them, other than that, it works great and feels good on the scalp.

This hair brush is quite rough on my hair it has pulled out a lot more hair then a regular brush I have and leaves my hair poofy. What I do like about it is it’s good at running your hair oil through the hair.

I got this because my old brush is really hard to clean but this is not only just as difficult to clean but doesn't brush well. I struggle to get it through my hair when it is wet and dry. I have actually gone back to using my old brush.The comb however is very nice.

bro i have thick long hair with slight waves and this brush HURTS! it leaves my hair so frizzy and takes forever to brush. it hurrrrts! and it’s uncomfortable to hold bc the handle is slippery and the brush part is so large. super bummed bc i heard great things about it

Nice brush, but the bristles are kind of short. It’s light weight…  they put a sticker on the back that took forever to get off. I still have some sticky residue. I like the wood. Iduno 3/5

I have had this brush for about 2 months now, was really wanting it to work to give it a fair try. The brush is very pretty, but it still doesn't get through my tangles and knots in my hair. I have very fine hair that tangles very easily, I find if your hair is already kind of brushed through this brush does ok. If not, then it's still a nightmare to try to brush through.

I like that it is made from Bamboo and that was the reason why I bought it. I just feel like it is made form cheap material. Also, it does a very bad job on detangling my hair.

I have long thick hair and it was catching on every knot and ripping my hair out. I loss so much hair just using it once. Works fine on my daughters short thin hair.

The brush was way too big.

I bought this to massage my scalp while brushing. But didn’t use to deranged.

I have waist length straight hair. It works fine, but I would not recommend for wet hair to remove tangled knots. Even with leave in conditioner it still creates more knots than it removes.

I usually buy bass brushes (“the green brush”) but they were out of stock on amazon so decided to try this one. Looks fine however something about the design isn’t nearly as good. This one doesn’t “dig” into my hair so just seems like it stays on the surface and doesn’t really brush my hair except for surface of hair. Would return it if I had the package.

I am afraid that this was a mistake. I have thick, medium length hair. 1st use, 2 bristles fell out. Already disappointed

Easy to use. Detangled hair. However, it did not stimulate scalp. It for you were using this on your scalp to remove dead skin cells for dandruff, this would not help you whatsoever. I was disappointed.

This brush got inconvenient when I had a ton of tanglesBristles came out as I brushed through them

i JUST opened the box and it was already missing a piece and it’s not loose anywhere in the box. i see there’s extra but i didn’t find one in the box so i’m already out one AND there aren’t instructions on how to put it in 😡👎🏻

I was really excited about the brush but it came broken so I was kind of disappointed that the quality of the product was not inspected prior to packaging and shipping. .

I really wanted to like this, but unfortunately it hurts and pulls so much hair out from the little balls at the tips like no other brush I’ve used.

Sturdy. Not sensory friendly. I had to buy a different brush. It hurt my head brushing my hair. It would pull too hard and nearly get stuck.

Bristles are too short for long hair.

Cool looking brush, but it did not work on my long, thick hair after the shower. It would get stuck. It took long to get my hair combed.

I tried to use it on both wet and dry hair and in tangled and unraveled hair and had problems in every scenario. The product is good quality, but not the best option for my curls.

The bristles all lift and your hair will get stuck under them every strand.

BRUSH IS STIFF AND PULLS OUT YOUR HAIR. I THREW MINE OUT AFTER TRYING IT.

Nice handle but when I brushed my hair the first time with it it came out the brush lol I was like wow

The brush was great at first but the puffy membrane is already deteriorating.

I'm not sure what people like about this hairbrush.  It doesn't grip my hair or massage my scalp as it is used.  I returned it.

Just received the brush and pieces of the brush are missing. It also just came in a plastic bag. Little disappointed.

Couldn't get it through my hair

This may be a five star for some but my thick hair did not like how soft these bristles are.

Pulled my hair out was not gentle!

Definitely not for thick curly hair.

Two bristles missing and I was not happy with the purchase.

Not sure this is any better than my old brush. Is this really real bamboo? Doesn't detangle the best ever by any means but it's an OK brush this far but not sure about all the hype of a 'bamboo' brush...

A very pretty brush. It does what it needs to do and is good for styling my curly hair. I will say that the bristles aren't in very tight, and will pop out if you try to brush hard through bad tangles. This is a good reminder to go slow and not rip your hair, but I also think they should be on harder and/or be easier to snap back into the brush. It works for now.

The hairbrush is not really good for detangling hair, despite its pretty appearance. I found myself going back to my old brush I thought I was replacing after spending double my normal amount of time brushing my hair. It just doesn't do what It was made to do.Edit: I wanted to add that I would not buy this brush again when the time comes around for me to get a new one, I would most likely go for one that had a stronger cushion (idk the name of it) for the bristles.

I have straightish medium-length, medium-density hair. I like how the brush provides cushioning support but it's way too big for me. I would have preferred a smaller brush.

The bristles are so ridged that they pull out more hair than neccessary. I have a lot of long hair.

The black comb didn't come scam for sure but the main brush came so definitely a 3 star. It's not good to promote something that doesn't match with what you're getting.

I think it could be more gentle on the hair but it’s fine.

This paddle brush is beautiful and comfortable to hold. The packaging was so nice, so was the free comb along with it and the bonus pretty headband I did not expect! I didn’t receive any extra bristles though and I’m curious about what the bristles are actually made from. I still want to be happy with this brush but it really snags my hair and hurts to brush with. I have long curly hair which it’s supposed to be suited for and my hair is pretty fine and soft. Not sure why it’s snagging. On the base of the bristles? Do they need to be longer? It’s does detangle it and feels good on my scalp but I wish it wasn’t snagging and pulling out hairs.Update: I gave this brush to my mother who has medium length, straight, hair and it works for her!

I didn't receive the comb. Brush is a little heavy not ergonomic.

I rated this a 3 because I do really like the brush itself, the handle is comfortable to hold, I like the bamboo bristles and the comb is really nice to have. However, I must warn you, if this is for detangling your hair right out of the shower, or brushing your daughter's tangling hair...... Don't do it! Save yourself and your sanity and get a wet brush. I don't think this brush is meant to detangle though, I think its purpose is to be used after the fact.My hair is fine, and wavy but man can it tangle up after washing. If I work the tangles out with a comb or the wet brush and then use this brush, its great! That's why Ive held on to it and continue using it.

Got the order in relatively quickly with zero damage to product or packaging. The packaging itself is adorable, and compliments the overall presentation of first opening. The brush itself, I don't think it is particularly anything extra special. It is relatively light-weight and it makes me concerned about the quality in how it will hold up. The flower design on the back is cute and gives the brush a nice aesthetic. The brushing cleaning out tool is also a hassle. It's a brush and gets the job done decently enough but not sure enough for the price.

The teeth on the hair brush are too sparse, making it feel like it's not properly combing the hair and slipping off easily. My hair is prety thick, I guess this is more for those who have extremely thick hair.

It's a very pretty brush. It feels solid and smooth in my hand but it gets caught in my hair and sometimes when I'm brush it will catch and rip some strands of my hair out. Fair warning. My hair was curly now its permanently straight and it takes some strands of hair out when I try to brush with it. But it's a beautiful brush that is well made so I will try again maybe with a detangler spray or water and oil.

It pulls hair too much.

The thing that holds the strands together is too strong to collapse When it needs to. Otherwise it's good for only eight bucks

I’ve had bamboo brushes for years. This is the first one I’ve bought that pulls my hair. Not sure if it’s the “bubbles” on the tips of the bristles or what. My hair is very long but thin and the bamboo usually glides right through. Not this one.

* Have now had 5 emails from seller to change my review**seller asked me to delete review. Sorry but I don't agree with that, the only bad thing I said was it didn't help static, and that's needed information for those who like me found this item after searching for help with static*Bought to avoid plastic after seeing it could help with static.So far I see no difference and my first use my hair flung up with static and was attracted to the brush. So the same as a regular paddle brush.But even if it's no different than others, it'll still work as a regular brush, and the comb will be of use, also received a cute headband (not something I'd use) but still a nice touch

I’m so bummed, I got this brush a month ago and I loved it but a few of the bristles have fallen out. If it weren’t for that I would give it 5 stars. Maybe I just got a defective one 🤷🏼‍♀️

Pulls my hair way more than a wetbrush. Wouldn’t buy again.

Brush is nice, nice feel and design, but the comb didn't come with it as advertised. Disappointing since I bought it over other products thinking it would... not worth driving to return though.

This brush is great and does what it’s supposed to do. I would’ve given it a 5 if I had gotten what was shown on the page. Opened the box to only find the hairbrush and no comb.

i’m very into hair health and so i wanted a wooden brush that wouldn’t cause any extra damage. first of all, most (if not all) of this brush is actually plastic, not wood/bamboo. besides for that, it rips out quite a lot of my hair and gets snagged easily due to the bristles, which have large tips. the only reason i don’t hate this brush is because after i’ve finished yanking it through my hair, it looks nice and soft, and very voluminous.

We bought this as a de-strangling my daughter's hairs after showers. We had an older one, which kind of served well for its life. We were expecting this to be used as a replacement but it dint do the job as well. It is an okay comb and comes with a hair styling smaller comb as well. This can be used as just as a regular hair brush not does great job as de-tangler.Pros -* Comes with a hair-styling comb, which is a freebie and works well.* Detangling works, but could be betterCons -* Slight heavy, because of wood construction likely* Captures water when cleaning.

Product was great for the first couple months & I was really happy with it. Though it’s been less than a year of having it & it’s started to fall apart. From losing bristles to it coming completely apart. I would recommend if you’d like to buy a new brush every year.

The brush it’s self is nice, made really well and there’s a cute design on the back but not good if you’re looking for a brush to help with static

I opened the box and the brush was missing a bristle, but I didn’t see the bristle in the box so it clearly was just shipped out like this. Not the best first impression of the product.

This brush is nicely made. I've used it for about a month and it seems of good quality. The bristles are imbedded in a cloth of some kind so I'm not sure how to clean the brush? Also, by the description I didn't realize it was a Paddle Brush, which is just too big for me. It's hard to get under the hair at the nape of my neck. The packaging was good and ecological.UPDATE: The company reached out and offered me a full refund because of my comment about the brush being too big so I wanted others to know this, which I consider excellent customer service. This paddle style brush works well for those with short hair.

It’s a very well made and pretty brush. However, I find that for those with thick, or curly/wavy hair, or worse both, it just hurts. It frequently gets tangled up in my long thick wavy hair, and certain vicious words can be heard flying from my bathroom. One daughter of mine has straight, yet very thick and long hair, and this brush does her no favors either. Another daughter has even thicker, but wavy hair, not as long and it is probably kindest on her. So I guess I wouldn’t recommend this brush unless you have rather thin or not very long hair. Otherwise, it hurts!

This brush is beautiful. Comfortable to hold and detangles well.  It's a shame the company decided to put a sticker on the wood. It totally ruins the esthetic.

I have a lot of wavy, shoulder length hair; I needed a good brush and I really hoped this would be it.  However, the individual prongs on the brush are very short and as a result it is difficult to get the brush to go through my hair to the scalp, I have to brush the top and then get under the hair to get the area close to my neck.  It’s very gentle and feels good while brushing, but I would not recommend for anyone with a lot of hair.

Wood cracked and the brush finally broke into 2 pieces.

My hair gets stuck between the air cushion and the bristles so bad, and it cuts my hair

one of the bristle heads broke 2 days into using it, and it's not like it got any intense use.. a bit bigger and heavier than i expected but it was on me to read the item description better. other than that it's nice and has great packaging

It can barely go through my already brushed hair without ripping my hair out

I had high hopes for this brush. It didn’t work on my thin hair and also not on either of my daughters hair and one has thick straight hair and the other curly curly hair. The littleBalls on the top would catch on the hairs and pull it.

I really like this brush and haven't had any other issues since I got it. However the bristles have been starting to break off and snapping. I never use the brush vigorously in any way, but the bristles seemed to just start coming off. And I've only had it for about 2 months now. Overall it's still a wonderful and beautifully designed brush.

Its okay. I bought this because of all the great reviews and how easy it "supposed" to be when brushing hair. I don't like it it pulls my hair and hurts my head and I'm hard headed. Within the first brush 1 bristle already fell out. I'm disappointed because brushes break so easily on my hair if 1 bristle falls out during my first brush then how long is it really gonna last ? Don't waste your time in my opinion

The brush works well, but I found it uncomfortable to hold. I had to take a couple breaks when brushing my hair because my hand hurt.

Would not get tangles out of my hair. I have very fine hair and it would take me over 20 minutes with this brush. It also would just rip out my hair

The brush is nicely made, sturdy. But I have a similar brush for years that I was trying to replace. This brush seemed the closest. But the Bristles are shorter than what i am used too. I have super thick hair, and this brush fell short on performace.

brush part came loose from the hair brush. the pick snapped like 2nd use.

It's a beautiful brush.. came in great packaging. I'm little.. 5'3" 115lbs... and I have little hands and long curly hair, so this was way too big and heavy for me. My wrist got site and tired. The bristles sometimes got stuck in my hair and pulled small hair chunks out. Would work well for straight hair that's easy to brush though. Got an official wet brush when this one didn't work well. Smartest choice ever.

This was a gift for my neice and the comb was missing.

The bristles are short, it doesn’t get through my hair very well, does not get tangles that well and this might be because the bristles are short. I feel like they are shorter than normal bristles. Overall it’s a nice brush, and the beautiful engraved design on the back is really pretty. The comb that came with my brush is amazing. I love that comb and gets my edges really good.

So...used it only 4 times and a bristle already came out while I brushed my smooth, straight hair so...

I don’t know if it’s my hair type or what, but I was not a fan of this brush. I do not find it comfortable at all and sometimes kind of almost hurts my scalp sometimes. Also, while it brushes through my hair okay while it’s dry, it’s nowhere near as easy when my hair is wet and I most often brush my hair right out of the shower.

I like how the brush works through my hair, however, it is not a balanced brush. The handle is so lightweight that it feels like I will lose it while brushing my hair. I am using the brush; however, I am on the hunt for a well-balanced brush with the same wooded bristles.

It does brush your hair. They handle is a bit on the short side and the bristles catch in tangled hair. Other than those little things it is a great brush.

I like this brush but the only issue I had was the sturdiness and hold of the bristles. I don't have bad tangled hair, but there was a knot I tried to brush out and a bristle popped off. I don't brush my hair hard or anything like that. But other than that it works fine.

I've always liked paddle brushes, but this one just doesn't do it for me.  The brush won't 'lift' or grab.  Strictly  for either a scalp massage or just to run through for a smooth before dashing off to the gym.  The upside was that the rat tail comb and the brush I later received as a Thank You gift work great!

The brushes really nice and feels great on my scalp. The comb is flimsy.

I have owned a brush similar to this one for years, have loved it.  It is now falling apart so I ordered this one.  I think it is well made but the bristles are shorter and since I have long fine, wavy hair it doesn't do the job, won't go through my hair.  Sad.  I will look again and see if there is another with longer bristles.

I like the Paddle brush style! Very sturdy! Good bristles, but not the best brush I’ve used.

Easy to clean, waterproof, and quality materials.

I wish it was made of all bamboo but it did reduce most frizz

The brush is good quality and durable. It does not snatch my hair out if I accidentally start at the top of my head to detangle. The only thing I don't like is the bristles are very short. I have thick hair and the brush only gets through the top layers.

This is a great value for my toddler because she has very fine hair. This brush I can tell would break if her hair were thicker. The plastic brush part feels like it could separate from the handle easy.

Really like brush but wish it came with bamboo comb.

I mainly got this brush because I heard it's good for spreading the oils from your scalp around your whole hair and I think it's pretty good at doing that. The handle is kind of slippery so I there have been a number of times where I was brushing and it just slips out my hand. I have 1a-2a hair and I don't really recommend this as a detangling brush but thats fine since it's not meant for that so I have 2 brushes which is this one and a detangling one. Overall it's great but keep that into mind when buying this hairbrush.

only came with brush

Bristles are very fat, hard and stiff with no give. The center piece runs straight across rather than being curved across and more raised in the middle, so the bristles feel shorter than should be. Because of these 1st issues I think I'll be exchanging it for something different...as much as I don't want to because it's a really pretty color and I love the etching design on back. I also like the color a lot...it's a light sea foam green, just as pictured. I realized though, I frequently touch my roots up with a brown brush in powder, so should unfortunately probably stick with black vs light colors.

I got this brush because I heard it was good, but now I can’t stop. It’s amazing for thick and coarse hair and it makes my hair fluffy rather than frizzy. Definitely recommend.

The design in the back of the brush is beautiful, but if you’re specific about what kind of bristles you have, you might not like these. They’re hard, but they are supposed to be bamboo; it hurts brushing through, but that’s only because I have thick hair. The brush is quite big, so It’s kind of hard to carry around. It doesn’t have a smell like some other brushes I have which I like. Every time I brush through my hair with it, my hair is always feeling and looking silky. Honest love it!

The brush is beautiful and well made!!! The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the bristles on the brush could be tiny bit longer. If you have thick hair, I don’t, this brush might not work well for you.

This is probably the longest lasting brushs I've ever had. Most of the time the little balls on the end of the bristles come off and it's pretty much not good after that. But I have had this one for a couple of months and the one I had before this I had for years without the bristles being broken. So definitely worth the money for how long it lasts.

Good brush so far, but didn’t come with the comb like I thought it would

It’s beautiful I love the roses engraved in the back! I would say the bristles feel like cheap quality but the brush feels very light and I recommend using with wet hair

the bristles flow through my hair nicely and glide through it. the detangle brush is also nice, and does the appropriate job.although the brush is a little bigger than I expected it to be, as my hair right now is on the smaller side.the brush gets the job done.I liked the design that was on the brush. the brush is also durable.

Gentle enough to brush/massage scalp. The wooden bristles are more comfortable than plastic bristles. Took off one star because the wood brush is not as good for detangling my thick mids & ends

I have used this brush since the day i bought it. I feel like it gets out every knot that is on my head. I am a little upset as I just bought this a month or so ago and a few of the pieces have already come out of the brush. I do still love it but it hasn’t been working as well due to the pieces being gone.

Worth the money

looks good and handy can use while traveling, love the design on comb

It is a comfortable brush and does a great job with my thicker, wavy Asian hair.Downsides: (1) Cleaning it is nontrivial! I've yet to find a better solution than hand cleaning each bristle or using a toothbrush. I suppose that comes with the territory of it being wood? I just wish there was a faster, easier way to clean the thing. (2) A bristle has come out and I can't seem to get it back in properly. I've not been using this brush for more than half a year yet.Edit: Company responded with detailed cleaning instructions. Basically, remove hairs and soak water with a bit of shampoo for 10 minutes. Then clean bristles with a cleaning brush (toothbrush works great). Rinse (remembering to squeeze the cushion to remove as much water as possible) and dry with towel. Sit the brush on the bristles to allow ventilation for further drying. The company also suggested that a more convenient way to clean the brush is to brush your hair while shampooing in the shower/bath, but this is dependent on a person's hair care needs and habits (I do not do this).  No further bristles have come loose so I think it might be a one-off. Considering the company's customer service and the fact that the brush has continued to work well, I'm adding a star to the review.

I just purchased this brush. It came with a free headband. The box and brush are really nice. Smooth wood and beautiful decoration on the brush. I wasn't expecting the smell. When I opened the box and saw the headband on top of the brush I thought it was really nice. The smell  I am not sure not a bad smell, but an overwhelming smell of either essential oil or a fragrance they put in. I was so strong I took the hair band and put it in a plastic bag. I have tried to wash the brush with soap, but it still smells. It made my hair smell like whatever that fragrance is. Very disappointed. If I can't get the smell out I won't be able to use this. I just wasted $10.00.

The comb and brush worked great so far. I ended up selecting this one because after reading the reviews, I was kind of excited to get a bandanna. Unfortunately, mine did not come with one but the brush is still very cute and the comb comes in handy.

It's a fine product. I have to clean it often but its sturdy enough. I just don't use it that much because it's really harsh on my wavy hair and hurts.

I have medium length hair and I want my hair to just barely turn under and it does a great job that I can't do with a regular round brush.

It’s a well made brush and very beautiful. Only problem is the placement of stickers. I opened my package to see a huge sticker covering the back of my brush. I spend 20 minutes scraping it off and yet there’s still residue. Although the brush is amazing I take away one star due to just the inconvenience. I feel the sticker could easily be put anywhere else, like the box the brush comes in for instance. The box will be discarded anyway, so putting it on the brush just isn’t the smartest.

I love using a strong brush for detangling my thick hair. I use it everyday.

The bamboo is great. It works really well in my thick wavy/curly hair. It has helped reduce frizz and detangles great. I think its helped the overall health of my hair. Less gets left on this brush than others i have used.It is kinda heavy and chunky, not comfortable in my hand after awhile.My semi permanent hair dye has stained the brush - but I am not suprized by this.I have has four brissles pop out and they will not go back in. Two happened randomly while hitting knots. Other two came out when I used it with a hair dryer.

The workmanship is of great quality though the handle could be more ergonomically fitted for grip. The handle is a bit flat.Over all its a great product and does not damage your scalp.

I mean, it’s a brush, what can really be said?There’s an ugly etched design on the back which surprised me, but I didn’t really look at the description or photos before purchasing. Doesn’t matter since nobody sees it.This brush literally does not do anything different than brushes I’ve owned in my 30 years of needing them - same amount of snarls come out in the same amount of time as a plastic one.I only bought it because I felt guilty about throwing another old plastic one in the trash after it wore out, and thought this was more “eco-friendly.” That’s a gimmick, though! It’s still got plastic on it but ya know what? My hair is brushed and that’s the best I can hope for.

I was influenced to get this & it works pretty well for the scalp stuff & spreading hair products evenly. just make sure your hair is completely detangled first. If you push too hard & make the bristles move at all your hair will get caught at the base of the bristles & it hurts & will pull out your hair. Just brush softly.

This is a great hairbrush for thick hair. Only a few strokes and can comb out my hair. The only problem is that it does pull a little more than some of the other ones (let wet brush) otherwise would have given it a 5 stars.

I’m not someone that usually write reviews but I ran across an email asking if I was satisfied with the product.  I heard about using bamboo brush is good for your hair but have not used one actually.  So I searched it up on Amazon and this one looks like it has pretty good rating.  Why not right?  I’ve had it maybe a little over a month now.  I don’t see much difference in brushing my hair comparing them with my other plastic brushes.  The design is light, nice and very comfortable to use.  I do feel that it brush through my hair more easily than my plastic brush but I don’t see any other major difference.  There’s a free detangle tail comb that comes with I have not tried using yet so I have no comment on that.

Really like the brush. Great quality. Not the best quality comb. Broke within the first few times of using it but i bought this product for the brush which i enjoy

I was super excited after reading the reviews for this hairbrush. My hair is pretty fine and very straight so I need to brush my hair with another brush before using this, but I love the feel of my hair after using this brush.  I had only used it a couple of times and then it broke, as it is not solid wood so it broke along one of the seams. A replacement was immediately sent and this one seems to be holding up much better. The little comb that comes with it is great, it’s handy to remove the hair from the brush and would be a great accessory if you frequently braid hair.

I like that the brush is bamboo and large but its a little too stiff and twnds to pull hair more than other brushes I have. It still works though and is durable so 3 stars

It does the job. Definitely not my favorite hairbrush I have ever had. I was a bit disappointed I did not receive a cute headband like I saw in many of the other photos. I probably would not repurchase and find a different brush in the future.

I had high hopes for this as my husband has broken multiple other brushes. I also liked that it came with the comb, (I use it as a parting comb as well). It's lost a couple of bristles but has lasted longer than most of the others I've tried. Will update if anything changes.

I have relatively thin hair and have to really push to get this brush through all of my hair when it is wet, so I do not think it would be great for very thick hair. However it is great so far for my thin hair and does not rip/break my hair!

It’s a good brush on dry hair. I bought it for my wet hair when i detangle in the shower (4a/b hair type) but it snags my curls. I get knots and it is not very good w those. I will try it again but the first 2 times wasn’t great.

Hold this one vertically so it doesn't pull at your hair. If you hold it horizontally it will pull and snag and hurt your head due to the alignment of the bristles (common in paddle brushes). Seems sturdy. The bristles have held up pretty well under my very high powered bl pro hair dryer on high heat. The cushion is fairly soft. The handle is not too hard to hold but not as ergonomic as some I've used (I have small hands).

Does the trick. But we misplaced it within a day!

I bought this brush in September, because I have long hair that gets tangled easily. Most brushes it takes forever to brush my hair and  hurt when I use them, anyways after having it for only 3 months the teeth are already falling out. I’m upset about it but it’s still a good brush , just wish it lasted longer.

I like this brush keeping my hair from being oily.

I like this brush a lot. However I have thing hair and thought this would make detangling easier. It has not been that way for me. If anything I think it rips out more hair then a regular brush.

I didn’t realize it was one of the bigger brushes & also has flowers on it as a design. I am a guy, but it doesn’t bother me too much. I simply should of got a smaller brush. It does the job though.

Already lost one of the wooden bristles while trying to detangle my curly hair. The handle is the easiest to grip and the rubber portion has already popped out and I keep having to pop it back in. I’ve used it twice now since it arrived a week ago. I had higher hopes for it.Update: I was refunded for the product by the company and ensured that the product has since been improved.

I like this brush because unlike other brushes, the little wooden bulbs at that end of this one do not pull your hair. It still does the job of removing the tangles, but doesn’t pull out giant chunks of hairs in the process! I also appreciate the little cleaning comb that comes with it, it can be so difficult (especially with fine hair) to fully remove all the hair from your brush.

Love the wood finish of the brush and how it has a cute design on it! This brush is very gentle on my hair/scalp and it does a great job of detangle my hair! Love this brush!

I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it - long lasting and strong, thus a good value

It works well, thickness,design and ease of hold..thanks

Detangles well and makes my hair nice! A good quality product! The comb is really is nice for bang touch ups or parting my hair

Much better than expected. Sturdy, pretty and the comb is a nice bonus

Pleasantly surprised with quality for the price. Feels fantastic on the scalp and detangles long hair without snagging too often. Easy to clean.

I like this brush a lot but it is quite big which sometimes causes problems but it’s a high quality product and I’d recommend it.

Best hairbrush I have ever owned! Received as a gift in 2021. I use it daily on my long hair and the brush still looks beautiful. Love love  love it. In fact, I just purchased as a gift for someone who I know will also love it. It is well worth the money.

I love this bamboo hairbush because it is great for my frizzy hair and the tips don’t feel sharp or like they will fall off easily.

Love this brush so much got pink it's perfect

I love this hairbrush!! One of the best bamboo hairbrushes I have ever had!!

I have used this for a month now and you can feel a difference. More natural brushes are anti-static which helps for smoother and less frizzy hair.I have long wavy-curlish hair, and my hair was getting so frizzy that I could not figure out why. Till I read that plastic-made brushes can cause static. 🤯 Completely, makes sense. This can lead to hair damage too from the plastic bristles as they can be harsh on hair.Bamboo bristles or natural wood bristles help distribute the oils from your scalp to the rest of your hair, especially the ends. Definitely, worth the purchase.

It was great for a pain free detangling. The bristles didn't break with any knots (an issue I've had with prior hair brushes).Would purchase this set again for sure

Nice brush. Exactly what I am looking for. However, THIS SIZE is  not meant for people who have thin fine hair. This is meant for people with thicker hair. A smaller version might work so I am returning  this and get  the smaller version instead.

Super cute and classy hair brush! This is my second time purchasing this brand and I love it so much had to buy another one my fiancé loves the pick it comes with uses it for his beard lol

Best bamboo brush we have had, really getble on my thin hair and limits breakage.

Good quality

The brush detangles with ease and the brush is overall lightweight, easy to slip into a bag

Nothing much to say, has been a great product so far.

Doesn’t tear through hair. Hair breakage has decreased. Loved it so much I got one for my daughter and she is loving it too!

And doesn’t pull hair out, great brush

I am happy with my hairbrush. I use it daily, and it looks durable. I highly recommend it to everyone.

Professional quality hair tools.  Durable and great for detangling.

I will be honest, I never bought a hairbrush anywhere but at the same type of place you can buy your groceries. This brush is amazing. It smoothes my unruly waves and doesn't pull. I just love it!!

This brush is amazing with tangled hair! It brushes right through without pulling all my hair out.

Love it

Feels great to brush your hair with this hairbrush. Very stimulating for the scalp.

Good

Loving my new brush, I shared the link to all my friends to buy the same one. Great quality , no complains so far.

As a dude with shorter hair (high and tight cut every other week) my daily hair styling is minimal, but this brush simplifies my routine even further. With a little pomade and a few quick swipes of this magical brush, my hair turns out perfect every time! It’s soft, feels good on the scalp, the spacing of the bristles is just right for the texture I’m looking for, and it’s durableeee. My kids and wife love it too so I ended up buying a couple more for them so we can all have our own.

I've been using Wetbrush brushes for years. Mostly the Coocnut, Tea Tree, and Argan oil infused brushes. They aren't bad.. but they usually cause my hair to poof and frizz up when I don't use a leave in before or after. I didn't have this problem with this brush, it seemed to do as advertised by helping to spread my natural hair oils evenly with no frizz. I have curls/waves and it didn't snag or damage my hair in any way. I also brush from the bottom and work my way up so maybe that's also why. Regardless, my hair looked even better after I used product afterwards. For softness and shine, I'd say it's about the same as wetbrush, maybe a little bit better. The quality is great for the price. I'll update if anything changes, but I think its a really great brush so far.10/30/23: just a quick update. I forgot to mention how this brush doesn't add volume to hair, at least not to mine, as it doesn't have boar bristles. Wetbrush does and the Argan oil one has been the best at adding volume to my hair. Just something to keep in mind. It's not necessarily a bad thing to not have these bristles... but it has left my hair looking a little flat and more straight than I'd like.

its a great brush, bristles are of great quality. Will update after few months of usage.

For context, I have a LOT—no hair loss issues here—of wavy, not super curly, hair that has gotten a lot finer and more prone to tangles post-menopause. I like to keep it at least shoulder length to make it easier to put up out of the way, especially when I’m going out three times a day with the dog, and so I don’t have to get it trimmed every six to eight weeks like I did with shorter styles.The bamboo makes this brush very light for its size (it’s actually bigger than I expected from the product photo), The handle fits nicely in my hand, and the brush does a good job detangling without too much pulling. Would definitely recommend to friends.

This really works great on my very long, very, thick, wavy/curly hair when getting tangles out after washing. Great brush

As someone passionate about sustainable living, I recently made the switch to a bamboo brush, and the experience has been nothing short of delightful. This eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic brushes has not only aligned with my values but has also proven to be a game-changer in my daily routine. First and foremost, the aesthetic appeal of the bamboo brush is undeniable. The natural, earthy tones and smooth texture of the bamboo handle provide a refreshing change from the typical plastic options. It adds a touch of nature to my bathroom essentials, making it a conscious and stylish choice. The bristles, often made from plant-based materials, are gentle yet effective. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the brush tackled tangles and knots without causing discomfort to my scalp. The flexibility of the bristles ensures a thorough and comfortable brushing experience. 10/10 would recommend!

The little tips on the end of my Wet brush came off again, and I saw this while looking to order a new one.I thought it looked sturdier, and the tips are part of the bristles so they can't break off. I'm hoping this one doesn't need replaced as often as the regular plastic brushes do.It looks nice, the engraving on the back is cute, and anything to reduce the amount of plastic I use is a plus in my book.The only complaint, if you couldeven call it that, is that it's bigger than I'm use to. Not a big deal, just different from my norm.It's pretty comfortable. I have thick curly hair and this gets through it easily enough. I did blast it down with a leave in conditioner the first time I used it, because it was making my hair staticy. Pretty much every brush does this to my hair though. It's a good brush.

Brushes my hair, feels good on my scalp, and won't lose the end caps like the plastic brushes.  I successfully brushed through tangled post-swim hair for both of my daughters (with plenty of conditioner).  I like that this brush hits a tangle and stops instead of skimming over it like the Wet Brush and the other detangling brush we have.  I worked out the tangles from the bottom up without breakage.  I have found myself overbrushing my own hair simply because the bristles feel so nice on my scalp.  Hopefully it will hold up well, but, if not, at least it has minimal plastic.

I really love the wooden brush. It has a really beautiful etched flower design in the back and the comb that it comes with works really well with the metal part on the end for every time when you brush your hair, you can get all the loose ends of your hair out of the brush to clean it. It works really well. And the comb actually works really good when you’re part in your hair so I would recommend this brush.

After years my vented wet brush literally cracked in half in my hair and it was time for a new one.My hair is naturally fine (aka prone af to tangling) but thick, but as I've been bleaching it for fun colors it's that much tanglier (and thinner from breakage).I got a similiar (wooden paddle detangler) brush for maybe $2 more than this one, and the bristles were so thin (as were the lil nubs atop them) that those mfs were snapping off left and right, and before long scraping my scalp. When you bleach the gd thing regularly, you don't need to put constant scratches on that bad boy.It's still early days but the first swoop told me I did much better this time. Bristles and nubs are thicker aka stronger, but somehow create less-not-more resistance when detangling, and the brushing experience (frustrating even before the bleach saga) has dramatically improved. Also looks cute next to my combo detangler/oil distributing brush as they're both wood with flowers. So far love the damn thing 😻💖P.S. Enjoying complimentary comb as well, dye brushes are pointed on the end but this sections better and helps clean brushes alongside the little metal broom looking doodad I have for the same purpose.

love my brush and got a comb with it,thankyou

I've bought a lot of brushes and combs over the years for my daughter, who has very long hair. She's usually pretty indifferent, but can't stop raving about this set. The comb is wonderful for detangling and the brush works great and feel comfortable in your hand. Would buy again!

I’ve noticed this brush is great with taking knots out of my hair and doesn’t leave it feeling staticky or looking too frizzy. The comb end makes it easy to use to clean hair from the brush and also works well when I’m trying to do updo hairstyles

For reference: I have medium thickness, long, mixed curly hair (ranges from several wavy-curly patterns).I was skeptical about buying this brush because i specifically need hair products that are meant for curly hair BUT this brush ain't bad at all!😂I LOVE the wooden aesthetic, i love the cute carving design on the back, and i love that it came with a nice quality comb as well~~The bristles, although made from wood as well, are not painful at all! Those round bristle heads are very gentle~ and i appreciate the ventilation which made this brush all the more easier to glide across the hair. I've yet to get my hair get tangled on it despite my curls which is a plus!!!😌And i clean this baby everyday with the provided comb which is very convenient~Only problem i have is that it says it's for curly hair but... when brushing through my dry hair, it gets very frizzy. (But what can i say, thats just curly hair problems 🤷🏻‍♀️) always brush it while wet 😉👌🏻Overall, this hairbush is a MUCH healthier options than the usual generic kind of brushes and you will NOT regret trying it out!!!

Great quality brush. Purchased in 2019 and decided to get another one. Great on husband's curly hair, my long thick hair and our daughters super thick hair. Wonderful product

Nice.

I love this hairbrush. This is my second time buying it, the first one lasted for over a year it’s just got ruined accidentally (not related to the brush at all just my stupidity) I use this brush on dry hair or wet hair, and I notice it doesn’t really make my hair frizz. I love the little comb that comes with it and I use it frequently when I am styling my hair or parting it a certain way. I would recommend it to all my friends.

I was surprised at the good build quality. Got this for my daughter and she loves it.

This is my second time buying this hair brush. Now, I'm no hair expert but this hairbrush keeps me coming back. It has never done me wrong.

I got this for my daughter on her birthday. She has been using it everyday and loving it everyday. She says it detangles your hair so quickly. Would 100% buy again

I order these when I’m in a pinch and can’t make it to the store and everytime I regret it . There is always one pack that is semi dried out making the towel rough on my skin. I’ve since stopped using this brand all together. I wouldn’t recommend.

Wow. These things STINK!!! If you like fragrance so strong that just smelling it makes you feel like you just drank a bottle of cheap perfume, then these facial wipes are perfect for you. Gag me with a spoon. These crappy facial wipes went RIGHT in the trash.

New product is plant based and NOT SOFT, dry on the face.  I will not buy again.  The scent is also not pleasant like the prior version.  Very drying on the skin.  I called the company , these compostable wipes replaced the prior product.  Too sad.

I use face wipes all the time, but this pack caused my eyelids to swell. The first pack I had no issue, but the second pack burned!!! Been trying to get the swelling to go down for days. WOULD NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!!

They can make sensitive eyes very swollen the next day, even if you only gently pat the eye to remove makeup. I think they changed their ingredients as I have used these before with success. I did buy them in the drugstore though.

This item is marketed as scented to produce s calming mood for use before bedtime. The perfume it left in my face was too strong and actually interfered with sleep.

I do not normally have sensitive skin or skin issues at all. However I started developing a rash on my face 2-3 days after using this product, I have used other makeup remover wipes in the past with no issues. I had to stop using these due to the rash.. I wouldn’t buy the calming ones

I thought it was calming ingredients because after my trip to Chicago to help my son in hospital my skin became real sensitive.  The water in Park Ridge broke my skin out and made it dry and sensitive.  So I got these thinking they would calm by skin no smell good to calm me down for bed.

Super disappointed with these Neutrogena wipes. I love Neutrogena's liquid make up remover, so I thought I'd try these out. Big mistake. Barely removed any mascara, and left the skin around my eyes burning.

This is not hypoallergenic. I used it once and both of my eyelids swelled up by the next morning.Total waste of money. Beware if you have sensitive skin…

I ordered and paid for a 6 pack of Neutrogena, makeup wipes and only received one package of wipes. Please send the additional five packages or refund my money.

Ordered the 6 pack, but only one package came. Requested a new one and ANOTHER single package came. So now I’m returning them because $40 for a single pack of makeup remover wipes is ridiculous.

Makeup remover should not burn your eyes. My eyes are still red and irritated the next day.

This product arrived opened and used! I sent back immediately.

I’ve been using Neutrogena wipes for years and I usually buy them from CVS or Target. These arrived and they were barely moist and very hard. Would not recommend. Better to get them in person

Received on ly one pack of wipes, the product is great but received only one instead of 6.

This product burned the skin around my eyes.  It was still stinging when I woke up the next morning.  I assumed since the product was advertised as “Night Calming” it would be gentle.  Not so for me!

Too dry to remove any makeup. Has to use 10 sheets and wet it just to get somethings off. Never again

My wipes came and they were super dry I couldn’t get my makeup off at all I don’t know if it’s the brand or the packs I had

I think they are old as they are very dry. I use the night calming all the time. These have no moistness to them. I see a product code but no date. Will not purchase again I feel like they may be old

They do not remove regular mascara, so I’m sure they can’t remove waterproof mascara.  They are soft and a good size for travel. I won’t buy them again.

These smell great and are a favorite of certain celebrities, but feel too heavy in silicones for my skin’s liking so they were a return for me. I prefer the original blue packacking ones for removing makeup. The blue package wipes don’t seem to have that heavy silicone feeling.

Ordered and paid for a 6 pack - received 1 pack

I only received 1 package of wipes. Description and picture state 6.

I chose this because it was advertised towards sensitive skin, but it made my face blotchy and rashed.

Should have received 6 total. Received 1 individual package

I was supposed to receive 6…I received 1q

It was supposed to be a six pack and only one arrived

I was charged for 6 packs & only received one. I was able to return & get a refund.

Please send the rest (5 more) immediately!!  Thank you!

There was only one package of the 6 sent to me. Now I have to be inconvenienced to return it to get my money back for a mistake someone else made. Lovely.

Only 1 package not 6

These irritate my eyes terribly.  I love the original ones in the blue pack.

they were really dryer than the same ones i have purchased in the store previously  will not order these again online.

I like the product but was very disappointed when I was charged for a 6 pack of wipes for 35$ and only recived 1 .. What happened to the other  5 packs of wipes .. ...

Have a subscription for 6 packs of 25 wipes every 4 months, but only received 1 in my last order!!!

I've been using these for YEARS. I just purchased a two pack at another store. First thing I noticed was the packaging had changed. Font and colors are different. More black than silver. But using the product, I am SO disappointed! They changed the wipes themselves and the formula is different. It smells different, doesn't remove quite as well and is so much ROUGHER on the skin than the old ones. I have sensitive skin and it really irritated my face. Why did you do this to us, Neutrogena? Stop changing formulas to try and save money when you are already charging us a ton for your products. BRING BACK the old wipes! Now I have to find another brand and I'm not happy about it.

I’ve used this for many years will not be buying again old & dried up

These are hands down my favorite make up removing wipes. They are large enough take off my entire face of makeup with just one wipe, including waterproof mascara. The wipes are thick enough to not tear, but gentle and soft enough to not irritate my sensitive skin. These are slightly more damp than the original blue wipes, which I find helps keep my skin moisturized and makes makeup removal easier and quicker. They have the most calming scent which is perfect for my nighttime routine. The double pack is always a better value, too!

I use these on the daily without removing makeup (though I use them to do that too).They clean my skin very well and leaves me with very very soft skin.These are so lightly and pleasantly scented, so you won’t overwhelm your senses with these.Great product!

I have used this product for years to clean my makeup off my face and it does a great job.  Sometimes I have to use 2 tissues to get all the make up off but that is for my face and eye makeup.  I close my eyes to  get the eye make up off.  No smell and is soft. Be sure to seal the container or they will dry out. I learned that the hard way. I put mine in a sealed baggy to make sure that they do not dry out. I have tried other brands but I always come back to the Neutrogena Night.

I really love these wipes.  They work on all makeup - but don't wear a lot of it.  Worked on waterproof eyeliner, one of the hardest things to remove in my opinion. The scent is one of the best things about it.  Soft, pleasant and calming.  I just love them.  Didn't cause any rash or sensitivity for me.  They are great for travel although I wish I could get them in a smaller travel pack.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

The non scented version is better because it doesn't sting the eyes like this one. Excellent scent and terrific cleaning of the face despite sting.

Love these sheets of make up remover. They are gentle and work well. They also smell fresh and are easy to use.

Love this cleansing wipe.  Cleans your face thoroughly and has a wonderful calming scent.

I love Neutrogena products

unlike the original Neutrogena makeup removal wipes, the night calming does not sting my eyes when I try to remove my eyeliner dug deep in my eyelids. And it has a softer fragrance. This is top choice~

Doesn't burn my eyes cleans well

Wipes were dried out and unusable. Not shipped in original packaging resulting in drying out.  Not sure if these are the genuine product.

I buy the normal face wipes to remove mascara. Thought these would work just as well. No. They just smear the mascara with an oil they have that’s meant to moisturize. It makes a big mess. If you don’t wear mascara you might like the different solution these are moistened with.

Looks like a product change. cloths are no longer as soft as they were.

Not a fan of this. Does a great job removing makeup but it leaves my face feeling almost greasy like.

I hated these. They did not remove my waterproof mascara and it felt very wasteful to use such a large cloth just to (attempt to) remove mascara. They were too rough and hurt the skin around my eyes. I will not use them anymore.

This did not remove my eye makeup as well as the original.  Also, am not fond of the fragrance.

These actually just made me break out more then when I didn’t even wash off my make up.

I was very excited arter all the great review and the wipes so help with make up removal. Unfortunately I've noticed an increase in clogged pores and tiny zits so i'm not sure what to do with the rest of my six pack :-(

Not sure if they changed the formula, but the perfumy smell is unbearable. I use these to remove eye makeup and immediately wash my face and hands.

I bought a duo of these night calming neutrogena wipes at my local drugstore before making a bulk purchase here on amazon. Boy, am I glad I did! I have been using the blue (original scent) neutrogena wipes for years and love them. The ones in the lavender package have the same consistency and remove make up well....but the scent is not "calming" to me. I expected them to smell like lavender, unfortunately; these smell like lilac and cleaner. Kind of reminds me of some bathroom spray that older folks might use. I do not enjoy using these on my face due to the offensive scent. I'm going back to using my regular blue neutrogena wipes

I've used these Neutrogena cleansing wipes for over 5 years and loved them. I was worried when I saw the packaging changed that the product had also changed, and I was right. These are nothing like the old ones. They are thin and have very little product on them. By the time I'm done washing my face, the cleansing wipe is basically dry.  I'm so disappointed in this new product!

In past, I’ve used this brand for travel and has been great but not this version.  It’s not moist enough to be effective on ordinary face makeup.  Softness was average and scent was so light that they should have simply kept the attractive purple packaging and made it fragrance-free.  I thought this would make my evening routine easier and faster but this has been a complete disappointment and waste of money.  Sorry but this has been my experience and Amazon encourages reviews…

Mostly, I am not a fan of the “lavender” scent, which does not remotely smell like lavender to me. Secondly, these makeup cloths do not do a thorough enough job of removing my eye makeup, especially my non-waterproof mascara. Please note that I do, however, give my strong recommendation for the unscented version of these in the blue package, which do the job of makeup removal far better.

This product has a funny smell that is not pleasing.  Makes eyes sting .  I would not buy again

I thought they would be refreshing, but the perfume was kind of heavy for me.  People react differently to fragrances, so you might like it.

Does the job. Alittle too rough for my skin.

Expensive

It was alright. Took my makeup off but burned my eyes pretty bad when I was taking off my eye makeup…

The wipes smell nice but ultimately ended up leaving my skin with an oily residue and I broke out more.. they do work to remove make up but we’re not good for my sensitive skin.

I found the product effective but extremely irritating. Additionally, the smell was pretty bad. I hate to be wasteful, but I ended up throwing the rest out.

I've purchased Neutrogena Cleansing wipes in larger packs at Costco, but Costco's are a little larger and quite a bit more moist.  I feel like I need to moisten these with water or some toner to help with the dryness.Will not purchase again.

I think overpaid for the calming gimmick for this product, but I gave it a try. It removes makeup with ease and has a pleasant smell, but defiantly did not make me feel calmer

The wipes feel greasy and leave my eyes feeling dry and tired. I won’t be using these again.

I FEEL LIKE THESE ARE OLD.  THEY ARE NOT AS WET AS WHEN PURCHASED IN TARGET OR WALMART.

Convenient for travel however the self sealing tab on packaging does not hold up and if product is not kept in ziplock bag or sealed container it will dry out. Unscented version blah but adequate size for use.

I like the regular (blue) Neutrogena  facial wipes better. My face feels like a thin layer of the product from the wipes are left when used alone (3 stars for that).  BUT these wipes do work very well removing cold cream from my face.

They are ok, they work ok but they leave my skin very oily and I have to wash my face after I use them. The smell is ok, not stinky and they feel a little bit soft.

Not the best, not the worst. A bit dry. I use these after using an oil based makeup remover on cotton pads to take off the majority of my makeup, but before an expensive cleanser. I won’t be repurchasing.

These cause my face to break out 🥺They also just irritated my skin in general.

These are ok. The original cleansing wipes in the blue packaging do a much better job removing maybe and are more moisturizing. These ones feel a little dry.

Great for makeup removal but meant for dry skin

Not what I was expecting. The product takes multiple makeup wipes to get makeup off your skin.

They were very convenient if you're in a hurry to get your make up off & don't have access to water.

Does not get makeup off

Seems to me that they dry out faster than the others made by Neutragena.

These do a great job of removing makeup, but sensitive skin doesn't seem to do well with daily use. Be sure to rinse or wash your face afterward.

Really soft and well packed but I broke out after using them not sure if it’s just me 😭

So this is my favorite make up remover wipes brand, I’ve been using it for quite a long time now, however, the one annoying thing that I can’t still get over is the feel of the wipes on my face, it’s really really harsh, specially when you have a thick layer of make up, it feels like the wipes are scratching you :( I just love this brand but if you guys can fix the softness to be better, you will earn the 5 starts!!

Moister please.

I have purchased the "Night Calming" variation of wipes 12 times on Amazon and I have never had a problem with the product.  My skin is oily and acne prone and I find that the "Night Calming" is best for these conditions.If you have dry skin, most make up wipes are going to aggravate that problem.  Clinique's "Take the Day Off" is a better product for dry skin.  It adds moisture and is applied using a cotton ball, which is much less abrasive.These wipes are not abrasive; they are soft.  But, wipes in general, are not the best idea for dry or sensitive skin.  I do like these wipes, because they have not aggravated my acne.  And because I have oily skin, the wipes tend to remove some of the oil.  These are great wipes for my skin type.Skin care is about balance.  Every skin type needs moisture.  The problem with most acne products is that they dry out the skin too much and that can lead to a vicious cycle of break outs.  For myself, I have found this process to be best: Wash once a day with acne specific products (usually in the morning); I recommend Rodan and Fields "Unblemish Regimen."  Apply sunscreen daily (I recommend Purpose Lotion).  Clean the face at night using these wipes and only spot treat problematic pimples.  Lastly, before bed, use a powerful moisturizer that does not cause breakouts.  I recommend Clinique's "Moisture Surge."Lastly, our skin reacts to many others factors: diet, stress, and cosmetic products.  Research your skin type to determine the best foods and cosmetic products for your needs.  Finding ways of coping with stress is also important.  Blessings on your journey.

Have used Neutrogena makeup remover for years, this one works better on eye make up. Not sure what the "calming" is suppose to do, but it does have a nice fragance. Would buy it again.

I've used the blue makeup remover wipes by neutrogena for years now. But I do like these more gentler ones. Soft and still remove product well.

I had a few from an older pack left, and ordered these.  They felt thinner and more irritating on my skin.  Moving to different product.

I like this product, however, after using, I preference the same brand only a different cleansing product. I don’t like the smell and it leaves my face a little dry. So, back the the original product used before this.

Just more expensive than blue (regular) kind. Would not buy again

These wipes do a good job at cleaning my face. I only need one a day, which with this pack lasted close to a month. They are nice to the skin, causing no rash or itching, at least for my skin. I use this along with the other wipes offered by this brand as well, and because I like the results, I do plan on buying more.

These are super soft and the scent reminds me of an indoor hotel pool room, which I'm not sure if I like or dislike but I'm okay with for now.  They change scents of beauty products so often I'm sure they'll smell different in 6 months anyway.  They don't leave a funky scent on my skin all day and they don't make me break out. They work well on eye makeup.  I just wish they had a little more moisture.  The first wipe out of a brand new pack was kind of dry and each wipe thereafter.  These are replacing my target up & up evening calm wipes.  The prices are similar, count is each 25, I just haven't been able to get to target lately and shipping is not free with them, so Amazon prime for the win w/ these twin packs.  I will continue to buy these from now on.

I only use makeup wipes to help get my mascara off. These are soft, the scent is nice, and do a generally good job. My only complaint is that they don’t do the best job of removing my eye makeup quickly. It takes a lot of time & often results in lashes falling out.

Scent too strong. Work as expected.

Prior brand I was using was drying my skin. This product is much better. I see & feel improvement. Fragrance is pretty strong though.

As described, no overwhelming odor.

I like this product, but it takes quite a few wipes and more towelettes if you are wearing length mascara

Moist and easy to use.

Very effective at removing makeup but it seems to be pretty harsh on my skin if I have to go over it a few times. Overall it’s decent for those heavy makeup nights

They are very moist and soft. They feel like cotton and silk on my skin.  Based on the ads, I thought makeup would just whisk right off, but the long-wearing lipstick and eyebrow colors required a little scrubbing.

I want to give it a 4.5, they're really nice, my only issue with them is that they're not that great at taking off water proof make up.

These work great for me.

These wipes remove my makeup and don't irritate my skin, but I can't shake how wasteful they feel. Hoping Neutrogena comes up with a biodegradable wipe (if you've heard of one they have, send me a link!). In the meantime, moving on to more eco-friendly companies.

I continue to love this product.  It provides a refreshing clean, with a pleasant scent. The only downside is that skin/pores aren't as clean/soft as with a regular cleansing.  Never the less, these sheets are perfect for clean-ups when in a hurry (or lazy ;) or when there are real issues (i.e. water/sewer limitations after hurricane.)

Part of night routine. Actually helps me sleep. The last thing I use before going to bed. Not battling breakouts at baseline so can’t speak to skin health here outside of- my face is super normal & I use this.

My face

These don’t sooth me to sleep or anything like it! I enjoy the regular scent best.

I love these face wipes.

Good

Super item!

Neutrogena is a brand I trust. I've used their soaps, gel and foam facial cleansers, night creams, and lotions for years. This is the first time I've used any of their cleansing towelettes, and overall, it was a positive experience.What I liked about the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Night Calming Cleansing Towelettes:1. Super easy to travel with them.2. They do clean makeup off your face - even eye makeup.3. They are non-irritating to my skin.  No redness or bumpiness.4. The towelettes are of a good size.5. The scent is very, very faint and not unpleasant.6. The resulting clean leaves no sticky residue.7. The glycerin that is in the towelettes leaves skin feeling moisturized and smooth.---------------------------------------What I wish was better about these towelettes...1. The towelettes are thin and they are not particularly soft.2. The towelettes are not as moist as I expected them to be. I am considering adding a teaspoon of water to the container to see if that helps, but then I worry about diluting the effectiveness of the cleaner.------------------------------------I like these Neutrogena Makeup Remover Night Calming Cleansing Towelettes for their portability, non-irritating solution, and cleansing power.  They are not as soft or moist as expected, but they did clean my face without irritating my skin.-----------------------

These Neutrogena Makeup Remover Night Calming Cleansing Towelettes do a good job of removing makeup, dirt, and oil on my face. They really can't tackle waterproof mascara but I always use an oil based eye make up remover then use a wipe. They get rid of all the residue. Thy only thing I don't like about these are that they seem a bit dry. I worry that they will dry out before I use them all. I put them in a Ziploc bag to keep them away from the air and they seem to be staying moist.I generally wash my face well but there are times when I am exhausted and want to just get the makeup off and clean my face quickly. These work wonders for that and for cleaning my face when I have been in the heat and am sweating or have sunscreen on. I like to get rid of the old stuff before it clogs my pores and apply a fresh layer when I am in the sun. These are portable and travel friendly. I carry a few in a baggy for removing smudges and raccoon eyes from mascara or eyeliner. If they were a bit more moist, I would go with 5 stars.

So, let me start off by saying that I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, I wear waterproof mascara everyday because my eyes water insanely, and I tend to gravitate towards long-wearing makeup because of my busy schedule. I use these wipes a lot when I am going to the gym and need to quickly take off my makeup. Sometimes I use them as a refresh post-gym, too. I would not say these are great at removing my mascara. I feel like I have to scrub and tug on my eyelashes to get product off. By the time I finish getting my mascara off, my eyes are burning from either too much friction or the fragrance getting into my eyes, I'm not sure which. The scent is really pleasant and I feel like it removes my face makeup really well. I don't like that I feel like I have a light film leftover on my skin from these wipes but it doesn't feel bad, just like someone put a light dry oil or facial mist on my skin. Which is probably a good thing because maybe my skin isn't being completely stripped. Most importantly, these have not broken me out. All in all, these are okay. My waterproof mascara and eye area are my main concerns and these wipes are not helpful for that. For everything else, these are nice!

I’ve used the regular Neutrogena wipes and liked how well they worked in removing most makeup. A few weeks ago, I also purchase the individually wrapped wipes to take with me on vacation. These by comparison seemed a little dry, not sure if it was just the packet I received. I don’t wear makeup during most of the summer, so I expect to use this maybe once a week. The scent is a bit sweet but not very strong, reminds me of certain white soaps at drug stores. It didn’t bother me much, even though I’m usually not a fan of scented products.

The best thing about these towelettes is that my skin doesn't break out after using them to cleanse my face at night.  Normally I wouldn't use only this sort of thing rather than a serious face washing, but I tried them just to see.  They didn't remove all my mascara however. Still, for days when I've not worn much makeup, or none, and when refreshing my face after work outside, they will do fine. They are soft and pleasant to use, but I still prefer the Aveeno version.

I like these wipes, they do a really good job of removing makeup.  They are moist, and they do not irritate my skin.  I do not like the scent, I usually like scents, but this one I don’t.  It’s probably a personal thing, but the smell reminds me of baby wipes.  Not something I enjoy remembering the scent of.

Nuetrogena Makeup Removers are great. They take my eye makeup off very gently. The wipes themselves are quite soft and almost velvety. They slide softly against my skin which is perfect for sensitive skin like mine. They leave my skin feel clean and refreshed, not heavy with residue as so of the other lines of makeup removers.

easy to use makeup remover towelettes.

Love these

I love these wipes, but they are so expensive so I did not reorder

Very soft and mild scent.

while we were my wife was happy she had those to take make up offr at nites

They take off all of my makeup without tugging on my eyes or skin. They r soft

I struggle with makeup wipes because they always tend to hurt my eyes. I love these wipes as they are super soft and work great on sensitive eyes and skin.

Good for sensitive skin

This product is the best I've used for removing makeup, especially mascara. It's a must-have, and I restock it every time.

Been using these wipes for several years now. Gentle on my skin and even removes stubborn waterproof mascara. It takes a few swipes, but it all comes off. Prefer these to liquid makeup removers.

I really do like this Product. It does a great job at cleansing your face and They make your face feel so fresh. I use them all the time day and night. They are so easy to take on vacations

After each use your skin looks radiant

Gets the makeup off and leaves my face feel soft and moisturized. Not sure how the nighttime stuff works but I like em.

Doesn’t strip your skin or leave it feeling dry but definitely does the job of removing makeup. Great first step in my nightly cleansing routine.

I’ve used Neutrogena Makeup Remover Towelettes for years, but sometimes they left my skin red and irritated. The Neutrogena Makeup Remover Night Calming Cleansing Towelettes are gentle and I don’t experience any redness.

I have sensitive combination skin. I've been using this for about a month, and it feels so good on my skin! I will definitely order this again!

3 in one package deal. My favorite go to makeup wipes. They are gentle get off everything ! Worth it!!

Best makeup wipes ever

Just as advertised:)

These work removing my makeup and keeping my skin from being dry.

I have very sensitive eyes. This one is the best remover I’ve found. Will buy again

Love it!

I don’t know how I never tried these before. I only use makeup wipes once a month maybe if I don’t have time to fully clean my face. These wipes are SO soft and I love using them! They smell good too.

Smells good, removes makeup well, moisturizes, I love it.

At present this is one of the only gentle makeup remover cloths that work and do not irritate facial skin and the areas around the eyes.

I have sensitive skin so finding these were such a blessing. The quality, the hint of lavender and the strength and effectiveness of taking off make up is FAN-TASTIC!!! I use them every day!Love. Love, Love!

great make up remover and sooth the skin.

I like these wipes, the scent is soothing and they are soft, not harsh.

This got all of my makeup off. Even my waterproof makeup!!! The smell is so amazing and my face also feels moisturized. I have sensitive skin and a lot of things make me break out and I mean A LOT. HOWEVER these did not! I'm so happy with these. This is my new go to and will continue to be!

I work in a mill and constantly have grease, saw dust and chemicals on my face including my makeup. These wipes take it all off. It's always nice to smell something pretty when I get off of work.

I use them every night to wash my face of makeup. They smell great and are gentle.

These are way better than their original remover wipes in the blue package. Great for sensitive skin and doesn’t dry out super fast!

I was using Lancôme makeup remover at $53 a bottle. I order these wipes and they are just as good as the espensive ones. They leave your skin feeling so clean and smooth. I will never buy Lancôme again.

These leave my skin feeling so soft! Don't think I'll ever buy another brand again.

Love these face wipes, they work great taking makeup off while still being gentle & relaxing. My fav brand to use, def recommend them!

I use these to remove all make up -- eye, foundation, etc. Find them to be effective and leave face feeling hydrated versus tight & dry. Pleasant scent.

I’ve been using these make up removers for 6 months now. They’re very convenient when I don’t feel like washing my face completely. They smell real nice and gentle to my skin. I will continue to be a regular customer

Hands down one of my absolute favorite makeup removers! Easily removes makeup without all the tugging and scrubbing that irritates your skin. Highly recommend!

These are super soft. The size is just enough. Thickness is just right. The seal to the package could be better but other than that will be buying more

Use all the time, can travel with them fit easily in my bag

I was excited to use this product as I have a medical condition that makes me get sweaty on the face and neck easily. These individually packaged wipes seemed perfect to put in my bag instead of a bulky package of wipes. While the wipe material is great, the packages are very hard to open. But the fatal flaw is Neutrogena has chosen to give this product a really aggressive fragrance that is really unpleasant to have on your face. To boot, my sensitive skin found it really physically irritating, like I wiped poison ivy on my face. Huge mistake, Never again. Back to bulky multipacks.

I have come across 2 problems with this makeup remover towelette. For one my skin around my eyes burns after using it and are bruised. The second reason is it does NOT take off heavy waterproof mascara gently. The one I am using with the remover is L'Oréal Air Volume Mega Waterproof Mascara. I have to stop using both these products because I can not get the mascara off with these towelettes without causing damage to my eyes. The burning after wiping is unknown... rather it's from the ingredients or from wiping and wiping and wiping the Mascara off but my eyes are swollen after using, sting and bruised.

I’ve been using an unbranded makeup remover with no problems. I changed to these for travel ease. As soon as I started using them, my eyes became irritated. I thought it was due to allergies from travel. By the 3rd day, my left eye was painful and slightly swollen. I stopped using them and my eye went back to normal. I’ve had no more problems since stopping these.

I ordered this bag of individual wipes to split with two other people for travel. When I opened the bag and began to divide it between us, I found it only contained 16 packaged wipes. I was confused and checked the package- it was labeled 20 wipes. I checked the order description, and it stated 20 individual wipes. I recounted each piece...16. This is entirely frustrating and makes me very unhappy. I do not recommend this because of this error in packaging. It should not have happened.

I was in search of fragrance free eye makeup remover. I put that in the search. I decided on yours because it was rated best seller. I just received it and when I opened the package I was taken back with the smell. Even though they are individually wrap. So I looked at the ingredients and fragrance was in it. So I looked on the packaging and it said sensitive to skin. You shouldn’t have your product pop up when I said fragrance free.

Purchase these to take on vacation to avoid taking a liquid wash. They did not not work well. Had to use about three or four of them one for eye makeup, one for face makeup and then three overall. Did not feel like they were saturated enough and that my face was clean.

I bought these to make party favor bags and all of the bags I purchased had 18 or 19 packets not 20 and now I am short for my event, very disappointing.

I purchased these because they were listed as fragrance free.  I am very sensitive to scents, particularly around my eyes as strong scents cause my eyes to burn.  These are very strongly scented.  I do not recommend!

There were several empty and open packets and since there were only 20, this isn’t worthwhile.  I bought them for a piñata so I wasn’t able to make a return.  Reached out to Neutrogena through Amazon and they did nothing since I didn’t have a lot #.  Do yourself a favor and don’t bother.

They struggle to remove waterproof makeup, often leaving residue behind. The wipes feel dry, even before the package is opened.

The product package states 20 towelettes. As I was getting my bridesmaids swag bags together I realized I didn’t have enough for everyone as I hoped had there been 20 in the bag. I had a total of 17!!! I wanted to give each lady 2 and have 2 for myself. 9 bridesmaids times 2 = 18 with 2 leftover for my bride bag. As I am planning to give this bag to my girls in a day, I don’t have the time NOR ENERGY TO RETURN. This is a dumb problem to have. Just SMH. And yes I counted them THREE TIMES!

DO NOT USE especially if you have any type of sensitive skin. I used these and thought they were working ok until after. Few uses, I woke up with my skin feeling itchy and burning. I was left with red and irritated skin. I will never use them again and do not recommend them.

After I started using these I noticed redness, itching, and a painful rash all over my face.  I also noticed dry and itchy eyes.

I saw other reviews warning of allergic reactions. I’ve used the bigger pkg. of these, not individual ones  so I ignored the reviews. I don’t know what Neutrogena did to change these but they gave me a horrible red rash and bumps across most of my face. I even gave them a second try. It burns. Rash again. Also had a new big pkg. of these. Same thing. Never used to. These and the big pkg. went into the trash. Too bad, because for travel they’d be a great convenience. I tried a different brand. No problems but sadly that brand doesn’t have the single size packets. I’m sticking with the other brand. For the record I’m middle aged, my face hasn’t broken out in YEARS. I googled info. Apparently they changed the formula, many people are complaining about the rash issue with their wipes.

I didnt think they helped much with mascara removal at all, while my eyes burned and itched for days after one use. They leave a strong soapy residue that is more harmful than helpful. I wont be trying them again.

The individual packages are impossible to open.  Also the towelettes do not remove waterproof mascara

Burns my skin.

Difficult to open if you have arthritis. Quality is not worth amount I spent. Have found better cheaper in other brands

This product does not remove anything.

I purchased this item to do ''Hangover Kits'' for my friends bachelorette party. I received the item with 2 bags open , so I had to run to the store to get more and this defeated the purpose of shopping online! Very sad about this.

In the past, this product has not had any fragrance. This order has a very strong fragrance which I dislike.

Opened my package the bag was already opened and I only got 11/20 of my makeup removers

I usually love Neutrogena products, but these towelettes made my skin pure red & felt like it was burning.  I can't use these.  My skin has been itchy & red daily, now I have to pay to see a Dermatologist this coming Monday.  I'm not happy, at all.

These are not fragrance free. Immediately gave me a migraine and I couldn’t wash off the stink.

All these things need to do is clean the skin. But some genius decided to add a perfume so your whole face reeks of it. This ruins the product. Not eveyone wants to smell like that and have the smell all over their face so you're constantly breathing it.

I specifically bought it to remove my mascara and it did not remove it.

I had allergic reaction

Only received 1 out of 6 packs. I paid close to $40. I am in the processes of returning the 1 pack. It is not worth $40. Not sure if this is a scam or people just don't know how to count. From other reviews, I am not the only who only received 1 pack out of the 6.

How does this work for travel without a scissors to open?

Really wanted to like these because of the convenience and the fact that i normally love Neutrogena products. These, however, were a bust. The wipes are very scratchy and left my skin irritated and red. There was very little moisture/cleaning product on them as well. Had to use 4 or 5 to get my makeup off and i wear very little makeup and i do not wear waterproof mascara. Super disappointed. Ended up throwing the rest away.

Only one bag came and I ordered and paid for a six pack.

Was super excited to use these but they all came in dry!! Save your money

I wear very little makeup so I expected these to easily remove everything as advertised. They do not. Didn’t remove eyeshadow or mascara nor did my face feel clean after use.

I don’t appreciate picking a product specifically for the quantity it lists and then opening the bag the day I need them and finding I’m 4 short. Supposed to be 20 in The bag and there were only 16.

Disappointed….ordered these for my bachelorette and package says 20 towelettes and only received in the package. Definitely a manufacturer mistake because bag was sealed when I received it!

The description stated pack of 6 with each containing 20 individually wrapped make up remover wipes. When i received the order, it was only a pack of 1, which shorted me 100 individually wrapped make up remover wipes.......20 wipes for $40 is rediculous......

Bought these for clients to clean their face before photoshoots and they have a strong perfume smell that is overwhelming, especially when you wipe around your nose. It's terrible!Also, these have palm-oil derived ingredients. Google palm forest and deforestation and you will see the devastation. There are lots of alternatives out there that are better for the environment and don't smell.

These wipes made my face feel like it was burning and turned my face red from irritation. Rinsing the cleaner residue from my face helped relieve the burning sensation but it took 24 hours for my skin to go back to normal. I wouldn’t classify my skin as overly sensitive but I have had other brands (Burt’s Bees and Body Shop) of cleanser irritate my skin before.

These are terrible.  Has an oily base that did not remove makeup at all. Took these on vacation and It couldn't get my makeup removed. Waste of money.  Somehow they ate not the same as the ones that come together in a big container

Purchased to put in gift bag. The product is fine, however the box is bulky and slightly damaged. The makeup remover packets are very hard to open without scissors. The packets are designed for travel but way too difficult to open. Just go to your local pharmacy or Walmart to get them instead!

These are gross! They leave me feeling less clean. They're so heavily coated they're almost slimy. The smell isn't that great either. I bought them to keep in my car but I've stopped using them because they don't clean well and they leave my face feeling oily. Burts Bees towelettes are much better, but they don't come individually wrapped.

I have ordered these before and not had any issues.  I have  used about 12 if these and all of them have been almost completely dried out. I had to add water in order to use them.

I paid for a 6 pack of 20 count bags, yet i keep getting 1 bag even after doing a return. This is ridiculous, I’m not the first person to complain about this, get it together.

These are supposed to be moist, right?  They are all completely dry.  The packaging is sealed, so how did they dry out?  Argh!

Facial cleansingWill not buy againDo not recommend

Great product. It would be awesome if they would actually send all 6 packs when you order the pack of 6. I have tried twice now, and only received one pack.

This would be a wonderful product and I  liked the idea of them being individually wrapped easy for travel BUT they apparently have been stored inproperly because they are barely moist. You have to wet in order to remove makeup. I would not recommend purchasing,

$2 per towelettes is absurd! Product description needs to get updated to represent what you’re really buying. Not 6 packs of 20 count each, but one pack of 20 count

I was charged $39 for what said it was a 6 pack.  Wrong!!!! I received a single pack of the wipes!  Talk about a rip off!!

I have three daughters in dance. I purchased these for them to pack in their dance bags for a quick, effective make up wipe. All 3 of my girls said it burned. They will not use them as it hurt their face so we do not recommend for our skin type. My girls are Caucasian and have sensitive skin.

These are awesome for travel but still make my eyes sting when I'm taking off eye makeup. Walmart sells these that are Fragrance free, which help a bit. but still make my eyes a little red.Still would recommend for travel cause they are the only ones designed for travel. Individually wrapped and good to dispose.

You may as well get the regular wipes pack because these are the same thing just folded down to be smaller in a harder to open package.

Didn’t take eye makeup off well

I love neutrogena makeup remover wipes. I usually buy them in a multipack but they seemed to dry out before I could use them up. When I saw this single use packaging I thought they would stay wet longer. No they start out dryer than the bulk packaging ones do. So irritating, hence the low star rating.

These are good for travel however the small packs were not sealed very well so a few were dried out.  This is the purpose of the purchase so the quality is poor.  Will not buy again as the idea was better than execution

I wouldn't say I have particularly sensitive skin, but these really burned the area around my eyes. I used one wipe and threw the rest away. It did a good job of removing my eye makeup though

These seem super convenient for travel or my purse. However, I was shocked at how much residue this leaves on my skin. I even tried doing a few water rinses and it was still VERY gooey.  I was in Indiana in the summer thinking that the humidity might be the culprit, but even in Colorado where humidity is VERY low, I had the same experience.  Unfortunate as this is one of those well-packaged and would be such a great travel item.I know all skin types are different. Mine is not greasy, nor is it very dry.  I found that cleaning my eye area was the worst (even though the makeup came off SO easy!)Just one experience but thought it was worth sharing.

it took my makeup off, but it irritated and dried out my skin, it also caused a burning sensation on some spots of my face. but!! i do have very sensitive skin!! i don’t know how these work on other skin types obviously!!

I use a lot of Neutrogena products and am a fan.  I am not a fan of this product, however.  I’ve used other brands of makeup removers and prefer the individually wrapped which are, of course, a bit more expensive.  Since I have been pleased with other products by Neutrogena I thought this would be great.  Not so much.  I don’t find that it removes my makeup well, evidenced by the lack of makeup on the sheet.  Very disappointed and will not purchase again.  One minor annoyance was why they put it in a fat square rather than rectangular packet.  Makes it harder to use.  UPDATE SINCE MY INITIAL REVIEW:  I have continued to purchase these regularly and find them to be the best in removing eye makeup for my sensitive skin.

I use the Neutrogena wipes daily and love them.. Unfortunately these individual wipes  are very dry and I have to add water.

I use this only while traveling. It cleans 90% of makeup. doesn't remove water proof mascara well n is skin drying

Super disappointed there was an unwrapped towelette in the package which was 1 of my 20 included. As you can see in the pictures, the inside of the package was filled with moisture and smelled horrible. Very upset.

I brought this for traveling to wipe my face off after partying. However these don’t do the job alone. Especially for eye makeup.I also loathe the smell of these and it feels like it leaves residue on my face. And I’m talking like the last wipe you use after you think you got all the makeup off but want to tripe check. Stopped buying these over a year ago but posting my review now

I like Neutrogena face wipes but only the unscented ones.  The scent of these turned out to be too strong for me. I like the packaging of these.

Ordered this expecting 20 towelettes (as described) but only 17 came. The package was sealed so I assume it's legit, but who knows. Very strange.

Leaves uncomfortable residue.  Doesn't feel clean

Most of the wipes in the bag were dry and useable .wish I would have know before I used them as stuffers for my bachelorette

I got these to put inside my hangover kits for my girls at my bachelorette party. They are packaged nicely and are great for traveling. They did their job but burned my face pretty bad each time I used one. The rest of the girls on the trip also said that they burnt their faces as well.

I usually love this bag and love it for adding to goodie bags but there was only 17 in my bag instead of the 20 as advertised.

These wipes were super convenient for on the go, which is what I was looking for. I was surprised that they easily irritated by somewhat sensitive skin and left me feeling very dry after. I would no recommend for dry or sensitive skin.

Neutrogena has been my go-to makeup remover, until now.Tried travel packs for the first time..Very hard to open at the "Tear Here", need to use scissors. Is formula different in the packs? Had to really go hard at eyes to get mascara off..Going back to Soap & Water!

I bought 5 bags and each had 19/20. Missing 1 in each bag. I needed 100 for my wedding favors.

It does the job but I can't get past the overwhelming smell. I have sensitive skin and after using the cloths twice, my face did breakout.  To each, their own.

Did not take off mascara. I returned it!

I’m giving two stars because of the convenance but these burned my skin!

Does not remove eye makeup/mascara

The wipes work great but are heavily scented even though the description said unscented. I am very sensitive to scents so cannot use. I specifically checked to make sure they were unscented! Very frustrating!

These towels arrived dried out. They must be pretty old or something. Useless.

It is easy to carry during travel as advertised but does not resolve my waterproof mascara at all.

Package was smaller then expected, less product then expected.

They suck so bad!... don't buy them, wait if money!

The two stars are not for the quality of the product,  which is good. But for the packaging. The packets are practically impossible to open without scissors. Who carries scissors on vacation especially when flying!!

Overall this was not bad but the packaging is really hard to open. Whenever you open the tiny packet a lot of water comes out. This also irritates my skin but its the perfect size.

Convenient...easy for travel...not my favorite...towels a little dry.

Thought these were packed with more wipes in each “individual pack,” I was wrong...Would not by again bec waste of money!!

These are impossible to open. I’ve only used two, the rest are in my drawer.

Great if you DON'T have waterproof makeup up remove; otherwise, not worth it and won't work

My mother had a package of these wipes, and she gave me a few to try.  I thought they were supposed to be moist when opened.  The ones I got were absolutely bone dry.  I had to wet them with some water before I could unfold and use them.  The towelettes were fine once wet, but if someone were in a place or situation with no water, these wipes would be like tiny little bricks and unusable.

I am sorry I purchased these wipes. Do they remove makeup - yes but for me they have more negatives than positives. First as others have said they are hard to get open. Second they are scented which is just adding more chemicals unecessarily. Third they cause my eyes to burn and since that is where the only makeup I wear is located this is not a product I would recommend for eye makeup wearers. I would recommend Diamond wipes which are unscented and get the job done without irritation and the packaging opens up easily. Plus they travel better since they are flat.

These these a pretty intense scent that irritates my eyes and nose. I wish these came in fully unscented . I won’t be purchasing again.

Overpriced and not a good design. Hard to get it out without scissors. Quality simialr to wipes I can get from paundland. Won't be buying again

Bought for gift bags for 20 people, only 19 in the pack despite saying there are20 in the bag.

good

I really like these makeup remover wipes - your skin feels very clean, they're very mild and don't irritate sensitive skin.  I've used them for years, so when I saw a flat pack of 40, I ordered them because the larger pack was cheaper per wipe.What I received was this bag of 20 individually wrapped wipes - which is wasteful packaging, which I would not have ordered - and they were much more expensive per wipe than the flat packs.This is not the fault of the manufacturer, but the seller or Amazon, the distributor.  I should have returned them but was leaving on a trip, so no time to replace them.

While this product is good for removing makeup and leaving facial skin soft, they are extremely hard to open, even with the little split area on the seam. Zero stars for portability, unless you carry scissors. Three stars for this being good once opened.

It’s quite good and wipe off the makeup pretty well, the only thing is it burns my skin and I have to wash it quickly to cool it down. I am not sure if I will purchase it again. But it’s great for traveling.

⭐⭐⭐I recently tried the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Facial Cleansing Towelette Singles, and while they do an adequate job of removing dirt, oil, and makeup, I found them to be somewhat lacking in certain aspects.On the positive side, the individually wrapped towelettes are convenient for travel and on-the-go use. The fact that they are made from 100% plant-based fibers is a nice touch, as it aligns with my preference for environmentally friendly products.However, I found the towelettes to be a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin, leaving it feeling slightly irritated and dry after use. Additionally, while they claim to remove waterproof mascara, I found that I had to rub quite vigorously to remove it completely, which isn't ideal for the delicate skin around the eyes.Overall, while the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Facial Cleansing Towelette Singles offer convenience and are environmentally friendly, they may not be the best option for those with sensitive skin or for effectively removing waterproof makeup.

Tinny travel park

The individual packs are very tiny not sure how they packed the wipe in it but they work fine

Product and bag description said 20 wipes.  Package only  contained 16 wipes. 😕

I use these for traveling. It feels a bit harsh on my skin, but is super easy and packable for traveling. They are good for short term usage.

They get the job done but they're not soft enough for the eye area. It feels like I scratched myself when I use it around my eyes

This was great to have on vacation since I normally use a liquid makeup remover.  It is so convenient to just throw a few in a bag.  I do have sensitive skin and it did irritate my eyes a bit. At first it wasn't too bad but by the 3rd night I noticed I was extremely red all around and under my eyes.

Works well

Smells to strong for a facial wipe.Couldn't get past the smell to use more than 2 packs.

Liked these and good for travel but won’t buy individual packages for daily use again.

This product states on the bag that it removes waterproof mascara.  It absolutely did not remove ANY of my waterproof mascara.  Total waste of money for me as that was the only reason I purchased it.

These are great for travel or dance competitions but very difficult to remove from packaging.

I love this product I think it’s a little overpriced, but I’ll continue to buy it because it’s the only thing that can get off my 24 hour lipstick

I like that these are unscented and clean my face so-so. Seem a bit on the dry side so not sure how old they are

When I first saw these individually wrapped face wipes, i just had to have them. I thought they would be perfect for travel, especially overnight when you want to pack light. The problem is the packaging, as they can’t be opened without scissors or a knife, and I don’t usually travel with either.

They are individually wrapped which is nice BUT they seem on the dry side. I have to use liquid makeup remover with these wipes . Just using the wipe doesn't take off your makeup. So I am not at all impressed an I wouldn't recommend these wipes 😡

Super convenient. Easy to travel with. And gets all the makeup off with one wipe.

I only recieved 16 wipes not 20. Normally wouldn’t care but I was buying specificly off numbers because it was for gift bags.

Hard to open

Some of them were dry right out of the package.

Takes makeup off so fast. I pop these in my travel case so I don’t leave mascara stains on washcloths while traveling. Can feel a little drying and chemically.

I received 19 individually wrapped towelettes instead of the 20 that the packaging says. Otherwise was as expected

I’m sure this products does a great job, I use the ones that come in wipe like packages all the time.  BUT if you suffer from arthritis like I do you will struggle to try and open them. I could not open them. It hurt my hands to keep trying to rip them open. I gave them to my daughter.

You go travel or collage use these don’t buy the full one you buy these .if your face sensitive than use a regular face cleaner.don’t waste ur money on these if you are at home you need to take off ur make up use the big packs I think it has upAnd down to itIf your not use full face make up it waste if you think about it .I would use a balm or face wash that take ur lil to no make offThink smart us less waste less think the pro and con what you could do with these

Make sure to inspect all items. One item was damage in the product.

Caveat: I have very sensitive eyes and skin, so I hope this helps others who do.This item is heavily fragranced with a synthetic perfume smell that caused an itchy throat and watery eyes within 10-15 minutes.The cloth itself is nice and thick and soft, so if you can handle fragrance, these are decent quality. They are packaged well in little tiny packets which is great for travel.

Works wonderfully in taking off makeup.

Good little wipes for a greasy face during a long flight. BUT! How in the world do you open the little packets? I have to battle each one to open it. There are no seams and the plastic packets are thick. I'm a fit man and I have a hell of time getting to the stupid wipes every time. That said, once open -- huff, puff -- the wipes are quality. Terrible packaging and design.

These were opened when I received the product.

These are relatively good makeup remover wipes. I’m a male that doesn’t wear make up but I do use these when I’m out at gym sweating or when I need something to wipe my face with as I get very oily. But this isn’t the point. I’d only recommend these wipes to keep for emergencies and not to use them in your daily skincare routine even though they seem very good at taking off make up when you are cleaning your face I believe it’ll cause some damage to your face in the long run as when you use them you are rubbing your face pretty hard when you are wiping and also that these wipes contain a very strong fragrance that I find quite unpleasant. I will say though I’ve heard these wipes are biodegradable which is a big + in my opinion!

Neutrogena cleansing towelette is very convenient for travel but does not give me the same refreshing feeling as the Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2 after applying the lotion on my face and neck.

I have to use 2-3 to take off all of my make up.Went through the entire bag in one week

Nothing special about this. Doesn't work any better than anything else that is cheaper.

Really hard to open

They fit anywhere but you need a pair of scissors or a razor to open it they dont have a tear here strip so i use to take my makeup off at the tanning salon and now i need to carry a razor so i can open it you might be better off buying the flip top ones a little bigger in size but easier to open I wouldn’t recommend unless you carry a razor or scissors with you

I thought this pack would last me a long time, turns out they dry up if you don't use them fast enough! Not really the point of having them individually wrapped! So use them up before they dry out!

Convenient, easy to use and carry but the remover on the wipes burns my eyes.

I love keeping a few of these in my bag bc you just never know when you’ll need one! Also wonderful for overnights, brief getaways- however, even in the unopened packaging, these dry out pretty fast.

This is not for me.the packaging  is tight and difficult to open.use scissors.these are not moist enough for my liking to put on my face.it does cleanse my face.

I have sensitive skin and I broke out in hives and red, irritated and itchy skin after a couple days of using them.If my skin had not reacted with any of the ingredients I would’ve said it was a good product because it took off my makeup easily and the wipes were soft. Unfortunately my face decided that it hates it.

I bought these to take on trips but they make mi face feel sticky. I used one and put them under the sink and never touched them again

I dont know if I will use it for the trip anymore tho, I mean it does the job well, it takes out make-up completly, but the scent is too strong and it gave my lips a weird tingly sensation after using it, I inmediatly washed it off. The feeling on the face was okaish.

My only complaint is that there were only 19 in the bag, not 20. I’m making gift bags and it makes it really inconvenient that I am now 1 short…

I bought this to stuff bags for a bachorlette party of 20. I only received 18.

Leaves greasy residue after use and eventually causes me to break out a few days later. I have clear skin so I do know it is the product causing my acne shortly after. But it takes off all makeup off my face and then I shower to get that residue off my face and that works really well for a completely clean face. Great for travel!!

I’ve been using the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, and they’re super convenient, especially with the individually wrapped singles. They easily remove waterproof makeup without irritating my skin. Perfect for travel or on-the-go, these wipes are a must-have in my bag.

I appreciate the individual packaging of these makeup removal wipes and will continue to buy them for that reason, since I place them in my Airbnb in hopes that they prevent my guests from using my white towels for makeup removal. But they need to be used within a few weeks time, or they begin to dry out. Also, I would love for Neutrogena to concentrate on using cleaner ingredients….

The Makeup Remover Wipes are gentle on skin and effectively remove makeup. Convenient for travel and daily use.

Cute little packages, worked great in bachelorette party favors, as described, good transaction.

I have used these before but many in this pack were dried out.

I love that they come individually packed, perfect to keep in the purse or for travel. I usually wash my face after I use it because I don’t like to keep those chemicals in my face, but still think it’s great makeup removal for once in a while. For everyday use I have been using Micellar water.

Hard to open, so I still use the regular size to travel with.Wipes take off make up effectively and smoothly. It can burn your eyes.

This product works well as a travel item!

Really convenient for traveling, individual packages, perfect

Pack hard to open

The towelettes are too small.  You have to use at least 4 to remove makeup. I have small hands and they just ball up trying to wrote a small area.

I got these to go in wedding welcome bags but also use them for travel.  It makes it so easy to bring just what is needed.

Love this product.  Wanted travel size.  Only problem is that you need scissors to open them.  And they will not be dried out!

Perfect size for travel. They do a good job taking makeup up off when to tired to wash whole face. They are soft and have a lot of moisture in them. Smell isn’t bad.

I love the product itself but the tiny packages are very difficult to open. Love the clean scent and no irritation.

I purchased theses to go in the girls trip hangover gift bags and the ladies love them. One wipe did the job. There wasn’t easy bad scents and didn’t leave me feeling sticky. Will purchase again!

I liked the fact that my white guest totels are not destroyed from make up removal.Now I can offer my guests who wear make up a way to remove it before use of towels.

They are the perfect size to travel and or store in your car!

I usually do not use the wipe type makeup removers, but wanted something to throw in my bag to have when needed. Very convenient, and does not irritate my skin.

It does a good job but is too fragmented for me

I love these especially when I go on vacation! I pack enough for each day and don’t have to bring the whole pack.

I have these on subscribe n save for our Airbnb. We have a bunch out in a glass canister in the bedroom. Renters are using them and our white bath towels aren’t getting destroyed with makeup. Win-win!!

I wouldn’t get these for personal use. That would be uneconomical, but as free bee’s, at a small party, they are perfect.

Did not disappoint therefore I will reorder.

In comparison to area stores, this was a good price for the product. I like these individual wipes for travel.

I like how soft and clean my skin feels after each use

I have never been a fan of makeup wipes, but these are absolutely perfect for girly goodie bags. I bought them for bridesmaid bags for a bachelorette trip and the girls loved them. They are practical and everyone will use them. They make a great goodie bag stuffer for any girls trip or wedding!!!

Don’t cause face irritation which I like but they are hard to open. Very convenient they are individually wrapped

I thought size was good, so packets could fit anywhere in my suitcase. Unfortunately almost impossible to open without scissors.

I use these when I’m in a pinch and can’t wash my face which I do religiously twice a day. It works with sensitive skin and comes moist and great size for traveling.I prefer the fragrance free version but these are ok too. I wish they came in a bigger pack though.

It’s handy to bring on a trip. Individually wrapped make it hygienic. It can be hard to open the package. It removes all the make up.

I feel bad with the single use but think they will be great when traveling this summer abroad . Refresh and make up remover handy to put in backpack or pocket book.

I got these to remove stage makeup and I really underestimated how many I would need at one time. Individually packaged wipes weren't very helpful. Maybe good for keeping in your purse though?

After reading a travel blog, I bought these for a trip to Hawaii to try out as my makeup eraser doesn’t get all the mascara out. The napkin cloth is well saturated and removes makeup, but didn’t quite get all the mascara (perhaps user error?), so I used my travel sized makeup eraser cloth and this napkin cloth and I was able to remove all the mascara.  The napkin feels nice and soft on the skin. It left what felt like a moisturizing film on my skin which (which I didn’t like), but after washing my face with my usual cleanser (Cetaphil), my skin felt wonderful! Had it removed all mascara I would give it 5 stars.

The individual packets are great for traveling but many of them were difficult to open.

Works well

Loved this for our cruise and I also keep a few in my purse ! love them

A little pricy but very convenient for traveling!

Really nice face cleaners. Only negative is they are hard to open with your hands only.

Love this product.  Great quality.  Really removes makeup well!

I really like these individual packets for when I travel. The only criticism is that the package can be difficult to open.

Pricey but worthwhile for the limited use- I usually buy the regular size- love these single use wipes. Neutragena doesn't cause breakouts or itching and it's a great make up remover overall.

Pros: Little ‘fun size’ packets can fit into any purse or pocket. I bought to remove eye makeup (thinking the tiny size is just for that purpose) but these are large & would wipe clean an entire face of any makeup or dirt on it. One swipe & mascara, etc. is gone- very easy.Scent is slightly flowery, pleasant & faint. Leaves skin soft & non-oily. Really nice.Cons: If only used for eye makeup there’ll be a LOT of waste: perforations would be useful. But then the packet has no closure- once torn open, that’s it. I imagine I’ll be cutting them up & storing a few at a time in small ziploc baggies 🫤

removes dirt and  makeup from your face . love the travel size and can keep in bag so when you need something rubbed off your face than this is a great product to have handy.

Extremely easy to use on the go, good price for individual wipes of this brand and quality. Recommend this seller, fast and accurate shipping.

I had a mild rush after use.

Appreciate these handy little cleansing clothes.  Bought because they are individually wrapped - often regular packs dry out before I use them all.  Perfect size to clean my face/remove make up.  Great for travel or tossing into your purse or gym bag.

Very handy way to carry these make using them easy.

So honestly I thought the size would be bigger. I am using these as part of my wedding welcome favor bags. I luckily brought two bags and I am happy because I can foresee that you may need two wipes to effectively remove all your makeup off especially after a wedding.  Otherwise this was a great value buy

I love the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, especially as a travel or on-the-go option! The fact that they are individually wrapped ensures they never dry out, which is a huge plus.They’re convenient, effective, and perfect for quick makeup removal wherever you are. Highly recommend for anyone needing a reliable and fresh solution for makeup removal while traveling!

Neutrogena's makeup remover wipes are awesome and this pack of individually-wrapped wipes is perfect for travel! I do a fair bit of in-home dog/pet-sitting, so I often spend weekends 'away' from home staying in other people's houses with their pets. Packing a travel bag all the time can be a drag (literally) and these convenient little packets ensure I can remove my makeup at the end of the day—without dragging extra bottles of face-wash/micellar water and cleansing cloths along. They are ridiculously convenient! These individually-wrapped wipes help with the 'less is more' mentality when packing. The wipes themselves are great and very effective at removing makeup without irritating my skin or leaving it feeling dry. I use them while traveling, house/pet-sitting and even at home when I don't feel like doing a more involved cleanse. I love & highly recommend these makeup remove wipes!

first of all if you don’t use these wipes they’re great. non-irritating, durable, very soft on the skin. i know some of you are thinking, “why use makeup wipes when it’s so wasteful?” but personally i keep a normal size package of these by my mirror so when i’m doing my makeup and mess up i can use like 1/4 of a wipe (they tear easily) to fix it. so the regular size package has been lasting forever. i also use them to take off non-waterproof mascara because i personally think it comes off much better than using coconut oil, which is my method for waterproof mascara. and even then i only need 1/4 or 1/5 of a wipe. i know it sounds crazy, but if you’re like me and don’t wear a full face of makeup try conserving your wipes like that. seal them well or they’ll dry out because you’ll have them for so long.anyway, because of all that these individually wrapped wipes are great. i haven’t needed to use one yet, but they’ll be great for emergency makeup fixes, spending the night at a friend’s, weekend trips, etc… i have one in my car and in a few of my bags/purses :)

I ran out of another brand of make up remover, that I took with me when traveling.  Came across Neutrogena and thought I’d give them a try.  What a great find!  Portable and makeup clothes in the small little packet is full size and removes all makeup with just one cloth and no irritation to my eyes.  Also found that while putting on eyeliner that melted and had an eye emergency lol..I opened one and used a Qtips to tap on cloth and helped me fix my raccoon eyes, I was so happy that I found these.  I now carry one in my purse all the time, just in case, so portable and small.  I even purchased large pack for home, really like Neutrogena brand.  Recommend purchase.

Love the fact that they are individually packaged. So easy to throw in your purse, gym bag, or toiletry bag for travel. One wipe is enough to clean your entire face! Smell great and leaves your skin feeling fresh!

As someone who wears makeup daily, finding a reliable makeup remover is essential, and these wipes have become my go-to choice. They effortlessly dissolve even stubborn waterproof mascara, liquid eyeliner, and long lasting liquid lipstick without irritating my sensitive skin. I took one to the beach because my face sometimes get itchy and they helped with that as well!They leave my face feeling clean, fresh, and moisturized even without using any other products. I travel a lot and they are the perfect size to throw in a carry on or in a small purse. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for effective makeup removal without harsh chemicals, spending too much money, and they are not as bad for the environment as some other products so that’s a plus.

These are great and compact and easy to throw in my suitcase when traveling.

These little gems are an absolute must have for traveling or keeping in your purse!  I was on a weekend trip and had forgotten my larger pack,of facial wipes. A friend offered me two of these to tide me over and as soon as I got home I ordered my own bag of them! They are full size wipes, just in a small, individually wrapped package. We are going on an each trip and these will absolutely be in my carry on bag. They are a great value for the money and you can have convenience at your fingertips!

When I was late teens/early 20s, I liked that neutrogena was a clean/clear product for my skin….never broke out, etc…..just a nice product.Now, I’m in my mid-fifties….and I just ordered this product for the first time.Wow! Still the same quality, my face feels as soft as it did when I was in my early thirties …..I honestly thought this was a great product for early twenty’s……but, now, I’m thinking early fifty’s…..and it’s still quality!

We are making welcome gift bags for our out of town guests and these are the perfect size to put in each bag! Love that they are singles and they do a great job removing makeup.

It's such a good product, really does a great job in cleaning makeup completely. I'm really happy about this product, will be buying it forever.

Love, love my Neutrogena for quick makeup removal that doesn't leave your skin dry. Take a look in the mirror after cleansing and you will be very pleased with the results.

These Neutrogena wipes are seriously the only thing that takes my mascara off completely. I don’t even use waterproof mascara and if I don’t have these, I feel like mascara is coming off for days. I wipe really good and gently wash my face if I see any marks or any lines or remnants of mascara I use the same one and just wipe those away, and I feel as though they are sensitive on my skin

These wipes not only remove the whole face makeup but also make your face so soft and silky , I would never change it with anything else

Need this for packing and going thru customs. Easy to pack in purse

Pleasant scent. Removes all makeup. Little hard to open if the precut doesn't work. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Easy to use on the go.

These are so convenient.  They are thick so they don't fall apart like most hotel makeup removers do.  Throw a few in your purse or the whole bag in your carry-on

Full size wipes, just as great as the regular ones and perfect size to have in your purse or to add to gift bags. We used them for some recovery kits for the end of my best friends wedding.

I’ve switched to removing my makeup with miscellar water but these are easy to pop into my bag if I don’t have space for liquids

This isn't my first purchase of these. They work great and are very convient to take anywhere without worrying about them leaking or drying out.

Got these for my guest bathroom and they are very good and I use these on the daily I love how the package lasts

These pre-packaged makeup remover wipes saved me so much space we we went on our cruise. I just grabbed one for each night we'd be gone, and they fit perfectly into my toiletry bag. They were perfectly moist and unfolded into a fairly large size. Will definitely buy again.

came in very useful to carry in my bag

These facial wipes are great to take on camping trips for a quick cleanup of your face when water is limited and you want to be conservative.

This is my favorite make up wipe and this size is just perfect for my purse or my pickleball bag!

Got these for my bag handy

I use to have to carry a huge pack in my purse just to wipe off waterproof lipstick lol these are perfect!

Best makeup remover!!!! Period

My favorite makeup wipes, makes it super easy to take a couple to the gym without having to carry the whole pack

These wipes are great to have on you when you travel.  They are small and compact and individually wrapped so you can just throw a couple in your cosmetic bag.  It's better than taking a large, heavy container or wipes with you!

Nice size!

Very convenient

I got these before my Europe trip and could not be happier with this purchase. Love how smooth these wipes are and easily even removes waterproof mascara!

These wipes work well to remove mascara and makeup and are perfect for travel or throwing into your purse!

I like these. I can keep a few in glove box and purse.

One of these takes off a face full of make up. The individual packaging is perfect for traveling

Perfect for bachelorette hangover kits! My favorite makeup removal wipes

Each individually wrapped wipe is convenient and removes waterproof makeup effortlessly. They’re gentle on the skin and leave no residue. Ideal for busy days or trips.

I carry a couple of these to refresh my face mid-day. Individually wrapped makes them easy to carry.  Never had skin problems till I reached ‘a certain age’, now I constantly fight oil build up. They have a light scent and actually feel a little greasy at first swipe - once it dries your face feels completely clean.Note: I don’t wear makeup, but they would probably do a decent job of taking it off.

These are perfect for travel!  I throw these in my overnight bag, backpack, & beach bag!  I have also used them bachelorette gift bags!  They clean well & do the job of soap & water when you’re too tired or don’t have access to it.

I purchased these for the convenience of traveling with them.  They're nice and thick and they leave my skin feeling very soft.

Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes are an absolute lifesaver in my skincare routine! These little wipes pack a powerful punch when removing makeup, dirt, and impurities while leaving my skin refreshed and clean.One of the things I love most about these wipes is their convenience. After a long day, the last thing I want to do is spend ages at the sink scrubbing away stubborn makeup. With Neutrogena wipes, it's as easy as a few swipes, and voila! My makeup melts away effortlessly, leaving behind a clean canvas.Another standout feature is their gentleness on the skin. As someone with sensitive skin, I'm always cautious about what products I use, but Neutrogena wipes are incredibly gentle and non-irritating. They don't leave my skin feeling dry or tight like some other makeup removers can.I also appreciate the variety of options available. Whether I'm looking for a fragrance-free option or one infused with calming ingredients like chamomile, Neutrogena has a wipe for every need. The resealable packaging ensures the wipes stay fresh and moist, even after multiple uses.These wipes are not just for removing makeup; they're also great for quick clean-ups on the go. Whether traveling, at the gym, or just needing a quick refresh during the day, Neutrogena wipes are always in my bag.I can't imagine living without Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes, essential skincare products. They're convenient, effective, and gentle—everything I look for in a makeup remover. If you haven't tried them yet, do yourself a favor and add them to your skincare arsenal. Your skin will thank you!

Never used Neutrogena as makeup removers before. And now this us all I use. One facial cleaning sheet is in a small sealed packet., about 2" x 1 1/2".  I throw a few in my bag. They clean my face of any & all makeup up  so easily & leaves my face feeling refreshed. Will continue buying these.

Works great used them on my last vacation

i put these in little goodie bags for my friends bachelorette party and found my new favorite makeup removal wipes

These are always great make-up wipes in a pinch.  Specifically, the individually wrapped ones retain moisture a bit longer.

I use them every day.Takes off makeup easily.

These individual Neutrogena makeup remover wipes are great for travel!  This is a superior product to most of the makeup remover wipes I have found!  I would definitely recommend them!

I hate writing negative reviews without giving the manufacturer the opportunity to fix the problem, but alas…We’ve had a couple of these brushes, and they are great initially. But, about 18-months into their use, the tines became like needles (we actually pulled what looked like a sewing needle from one). Needless to say, it hurt my daughter and we have since disposed of it.I don’t know if this is a systemic problem, or a fluke in the one I purchased. Buyer beware!

I broke my favorite boar bristle hairbrush. I got this as a replacement. It arrived today. I ran it over my hair for the first time.I screamed.Those tiny bulbs at the end of those plastic rods got stuck in my hair. I had to tease my hair out of the brush.I decided to read the directions that came with the brush. It said that if your hair had tangles (my curly hair always has tangles) I should run a coarse comb through my hair first. The brush kit comes with a coarse comb, so I tried it. I detangled from the ends of my hair first, then went towards the base. Then I went back to the brush.I screamed again. Maybe not as loudly this time.I went through the cycle a couple more times, because I'm too obstinate to learn my lesson. I could finally brush without screaming. But I knew that wouldn't last; the following morning I'd be screaming again unless I went through a lengthy cycle with that coarse comb.The advertising on the web page claims that it's a "boar bristle" brush. Maybe the shorter bits are boar bristles. But those knobby plastic bits are murder on my hair.The advertising also claims that the brush can detangle hair and is healthier for your scalp. Maybe for other types of hair than mine, but I not mine.If you have curly dry hair, stay away from this brush.Unless you enjoy screaming.

Smells awful after first time cleaning. I washed the hairbrush with a bristle brush and dawn soap and let dry in the sun for a couple hours. A hairbrush should normally be cleaned about 2-4x a month but the smell it left afterwards was so awful I could not use it anymore. I expected  to brush my freshly cleansed hair only for the hairbrush I just cleaned, to leave my hair smelling like sewer.  I cannot get the smell out, Im extremely disappointed.

The most painful hairbrush everInto the trash it goesOUCH

I tried washing it and it left a putrid odor that would not come out no matter what I tried what a disappointing product

We bought a similar boars hair brush by this same brand for my laugh tee and she loved it, but she accidentally lost it.  It was such a great brush that I bought two of these for myself and her to replace it.  Unfortunately we both find this version painful to use.  I wish they would get the original back in stock.

I thought this would be healthier for my daughter but it is trash. It hurts her when I brush her hair so it was thrown away

The brush is terrible, but the comb is nice.

I'm not sure why I bought this. Might be good with straight hair but it gets tangled in my curly hair.

I wanted to buy a good quality brush for my long hair but every time I use this brush and makes my scalp so oily I don’t know why such a shame. I really had high hopes for this brush, but don’t buy unless you have a oily scalp.

I don't like to give negative reviews but I feel I must to help others not to choose this brush.I have long medium thick hair on the dry side. I bought this for scalp massage and to distribute natural oils.Instead of detanglng, my hair would get " hitched up" in the bristles and the stress would break off strands. It's the way the bristles are spaced and placed on the brush bedand the nylon capped nylon bristles.  I didn't realize it at first, but now I have hair of all lengths because it's broken!The  boar bristles are not long enough to get to your scalp anyway and they ruined it by placing long nylon bristles among the shorter boar bristles. Boar bristles can't touch scalp to do their massage. The nylon bristles are capped with round tips that are hard, uncomfortable and also " hitches up" in tangles and break the hair off.Absolutely a terrible brush. The damage is done ( from November to February) when I realized it, it was too late.

It didn't even work on my hair and got my hair all tangled

Okay, I bought this because it has so many good reviews. After using it one time, I have no idea how that is possible because I certainly dont want my hair to smell like poop... After washing my hair, I was excited to try my new brush. However, as I am brushing my hair I start smelling this horrible smell. Looked at my dog like "ewww what in the world did you eat (thinking he let out a massive fart!!)"... Finished brushing my hair and realized it was the brush!! I am not even joking, it smells like the bristles came from an animal that had just rolled in its own poop... Dont worry, I instantly rewashed my hair!! Anywayyy, I tried to wash the brush three times and with each wash bristles are flying out all over the place and it STILL smells... After reading the negative reviews it seems there are several people who also had this problem. Save yourself the trouble! Don't buy unless you want poop scented hair... Gross!

Pulls hair out instead of detangling. Especially if you brush wet hair. The bristles have bent and not stayed in place. I’ve only had this brush for few weeks. Already through it away

After a short time using it there's an odor to the brush that will not come out even after washing it thoroughly.None of my other brushes have this issue

Really didn't like this brush,  pulls hair and doesn't do a good job at all.

This is the first hairbrush I’ve used in my 41 years of life that actually made my hair more tangled as I brushed. I don’t even know how that’s possible. I have wavy, fine hair. Terrible product.

This truly is a beautiful brush and I wanted to love it, but the one I got has a really terrible smell! Out of the box it smelled faintly like chemicals which I assumed is normal at first and would fade. After a week of normal use brushing my clean hair (And I have washed it with gentle shampoo) it somehow smells even more off-putting. Like I said, it’s a beautiful brush and brushes hair well, but I can’t use it without my hair smelling like a combination of chemicals and locker room and it’s super gross.It also has a coating that has started to chip after just one week. I may have just gotten a defective model but the smell is pretty bad.Update: After cleaning yet again, this brush STILL smells terrible. I will consider amending my review if the seller makes an effort to fix this and send a non defective model.

I bought this brush and in the beginning I was very happy with it but after ONLY 4 months of use the bristles started to disintegrate, dust and powder / fluff comes out of them constantly. It is not dust from the environment, since I clean it the whole time (in fact the pictures are from shortly after cleaning) and keep it in a drawer. You clean the bristles, and this dust or fluff appears again from the bristles. IN BIG AMOUNTS. So it is imposible to use because your hair gets full of fluff and dust.I am very disappointed with this product. I wrote amazon and they litteraly did not care at all. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY AFTER 4 MONTHS.

I’ve never used a brush that rips even close to the amount of hair this brush does out of my head. Absolutely awful.

This is the worst brush ever. It gets stuck in your hair constantly and hurts or tires to rip your hair off. Its way to aggressive. It’s also very heavy and makes your shoulder hurt. Do NOT buy. Also Amazon wants me to send the old back after using it which I think is pretty gross.

I am not sure how it got such good reviews. I used it on my sensitive 9 year old daughter and I didn't even get one stroke in without her crying. I told her it can't be that bad it got such good reviews! I tried it and I understand why! It hurt so bad and I'm an adult who usually just yanks through her hair! We will definitely stick with wet brushes. Overall I do not recommend. I would return if I could....

This brush is supposed to be for fine hair.  It is way too compact in the bristle area.  I couldn't get the brush through my hair.  At the end of trying to comb my hair, I found that there was a ton of hair caught in the bristles.  I am not sure who this brush would be best for, but it's not fine, long hair.

The brush stinks so bad that I hate using it … a weird chemical smell.  I thought it might dissipate after a few days or weeks … nope.  I also laid it on some drops of water on the counter and the brush absorbed the water and discolored it as you can see in the photo.  I would not purchase again 😢

Noa big deal , works just like a dollar store brush.

I have waged the bristles, this brush has an awful smell!

This brush pulls my hair out!. Returned it

The hairbrush came clearly used as it had someone else’s hair in it, and the comb was not included although the plastic I assume it was supposed to come in was inside the box and torn open like it had been in there but was removed. Bought this because of the good reviews I read but I’m pretty weirded out and not gonna use a brush that a stranger used. Sus.

Only used this once never again it didn't make my hair smooth it made it hard to brush

worst hair brush I’ve ever used, instantly snarls my hair.  Wouldn’t recommend this product for anyone, garbage.

I don’t understand all of the glowing reviews for this hair brush. There are issues with the design and the materials used.1. The plastic bristles are too thick, too long and too stiff. Hair barely engages with the shorter boar bristles. The plastic bristles have no give.2. The “cushion” part of the brush is very stiff and made of a cheap plastic type material that has a terrible chemical odor.3. Loose boar bristles are falling out.4. Cheap 10 cent plastic comb and cheap 5 cent hair ties included (how generous).Nope, this brush is just not a winner.

I have had this brush for one month. Tonight I found this on the floor. Sure enough it fell out of the brush. Poor quality! I had my previous brush for many years and nothing ever fell out. And of course, the return deadline was three days ago…. Very disappointed.

I’ve bought similar brushes to this one before by other companies, but this one is the first one where it’s actually uncomfortable to use. The bristles of the brush scratch the head and it is painful to use because there was no quality control. This is not the norm with this type of brush and something is defective.

Never received brush

I purchased this brush after much research.  I have fine long hair. The brown bristles were are short and fell n my hair, floor and my pillow, I do not use any products per the instructions. I I primarily bought it to brush my hair out when it’s dry several times a day. I would not recommend purchasing due  to the fact the bristles come out. I threw the box away and now I can’t return it. On a good note it did come with a smaller round brush and a comb. I like the comb very much.

This brush and comb have a terrible odor.  I’m not sure if it’s chemical but it’s very strong.  I’ve washed them both and they still smell.  I have them outside now because I’m not sure it’s safe to breathe.  Hopefully the fresh air will help.  If not, I will throw them away.  A waste of money!

I was happy to see a brush that would be sturdy enough to manage my thick hair. but this brush I could not use it after that terrible smell. It's very chemical and does not go away. I thought maybe it was just the box or something but it was the brush. I would not recommend putting that near your hair!

This product is awful. After just 3 days of brushing my wet hair, I noticed the brush began to smell and shed and I was not able to clean it. Despite all my efforts, (washing the brush, making sure it air dried after each use, and even limiting my usage) the brush continued to smell and lose bristles. Huge waste of money! I have since purchased a Wet Brush which is way better for your hair, cheaper, and does not smell like mildew and burnt plastic. Very disappointed in this product.

I liked it until the protective black caps stared falling off the white nylon bristles (see pictures). Once those black caps fall off the white nylon bristles have very sharp edges and it feels like an implement of torture; like running razor blades over your scalp.

This brush looks like it is full with bristles because of the black backing the bristles are attatched to.  In reality there are very few boar bristles.  Pay a little more and get a real boar bristle brush.

Honestly, this is a disgusting. The brush had hair in it when it arrived at my house. The seal was broken and the small comb was not in the box. If someone returns this product, there needs to be better quality control on returns. I don’t want a strangers hair in my house. Really appalling.

This brush is not good. It pulls knots out instead of working them free. The nubs feel too hard on my scalp without feeling any scalp rejuvenating effects. The boar bristles are too densely packed to penetrate my hair. So it’s basically a plastic bristle brush. I did like the nice wide paddle for blow drying my hair straight but it would pull so often I would have to put my dryer down to work through the knots very carefully.

I would give it a zero if I could.Security seal came broken and my  brush came used. It had hair and dandruff 🤮🤮🤮

I gave this brush a solid try. No matter if hair is wet or dry, instead of detangling it, it tangles it even more and just breaks the hair. Do not buy.

Poor quality. Used it snd a lot of it’s bristles fell out, does NOT DETANGLE, just rips. Horrible design. Extremely disappointed.

Not worth it. Cannot clean it because bristiles won't stay in and fabric holding bristles in fell apart completely.

It smells like they took recycled tires to make the brush. After cleaning the brush with a mild cleanser and allowing it to air out for a few weeks, the smell is exactly the same. I thought maybe the smell wouldn't be an issue and tested the brush on the end of a section of hair and the smell transferred to the hair. I do not want a product that makes my hair smell like tires!

Had this brush for less than 2 months.  Will never buy again and I feel it is necessary to warn all consumers about this shoddy workmanship.  This is my second brush.  Issue has happened both times.

Omgosh it smells. The brush smells so gross..  ewwwwwwwwwwww. And the worst part is ,my hair smells like this stinky brush. Washed my hair 2 times before the smell came out. Do not purchase.  Plsssss or you'll be sorry 😞

Couldn’t get through my thick hair. I would return if I could. Wet brush works way better!

I loved the look of this brush when I saw it on the site but in person it’s sturdy and strong. It cuts through tangled hair like nothing else. My daughter tried to steal it from me on her last visit so I know what she’s getting for her birthday! I have fine thin hair so I needed a brush that would get rid of the tangles without breaking my hair and this brush does it. It feels good on your scalp and I even use it while blow drying. Great paddle brush!

I love the little surprise. That was very sweet. The brush feels nice and brushes great w no pulls. Love the butterfly design and the handle is comfortable. Love this brush combo

Well, you know the old saying “my dog ate my homework”? Yeah - just replace “homework” with “hair brush” and you’ve got my situation. I turned to Amazon (as I always do) and searched for the BASS brand and almost hit that purchase button until I saw the prop warning - you know, that yucky one about cancer. I thought to myself, how can a hairbrush have that warning?! And I immediately searched for something else and I’m SO happy I did because it led me here - to the best quality brush I’ve discovered in years. It’s heavy duty, but doesn’t hurt, doesn’t pull hair, works beautifully, and you literally can’t beat the price. 10/10 recommend - especially if your dog ate yours for it’s afternoon snack ;)

The packaging was good enough and everything was shipped pretty expeditiously. 👍 The brush itself is phenomenal. I have a lot of very fine wavy hair and my daughter has fine tight curls. Both of our hair is very thick , and the brush had no problem getting through. This brush really helps detangle our hair gently and the boar bristles massage the scalp and distribute oils very nicely.  It left our hair smoothed out and soft and I absolutely love it. Best boar-bristle nylon combo brush I've ever owned. Altough , I would not be able to use the brush on my husband's very tight african coils , so it should be made apparent that this is not a product for everyone and people with coarse hairstrands and extremely tight coils should not waste their money. The comb seems to be made cheaply and it was a little rough around the edges. I shaved it down with my scissors and it's fine now. The point is very round , so if you were planning on using this comb for parting sections , it will not do the job very well. On a positive note , the comb is very thick and sturdy and I use it to detangle my daughter's hair in the tub , so it makes a nice wet-comb. I would say , it's worth the price for the brush , and getting the comb is just a bonus. I would not base your purchase of this off of the comb alone.

I love the look, feel, and size of this brush. It is so easy to clean. The comb it comes with is also great. I’m so happy with this purchase.

Happy with this brush as a replacement for my old one that got moldy. It actually comes with instructions 😂😅🙈 So, yeah, don’t leave wet hair in it (you can clean it very quickly & easily with the accompanying comb), put it in a ventilated/bright/warm area after use if you live in a humid climate.My hair’s very voluminous, whisper fine and Crystal Gale long & this does it up proper within 60s or less.You don’t necessarily think much about a brush unless it isn’t working well, so I wanted to take the time to say this one is my favorite to date. No snagging, split ends, breakage, just a good brush all around.

The rubber bristles grab the hair and the boar bristles smooth the hair when blow drying. The paddle shape can keep the ends straight or rounded. The most versatile brush I’ve ever owned.

This is my new favorite brush.  I've always had a sensitive scalp, any tangles hurt even when I brushed softly and from the bottom up. I hated brushing and all my life I've struggled with knots and mats preferring to keep my hair short to avoid the pain.  I remembered as a kid having a boars hair brush and it smoothed my hair nicely but couldn't remove the tangles. So when I saw this brush, I figured I'd give it a shot. It works amazingly.  The tangles don't hurt as much,  it spreads the oil from my scalp evenly over my hair leaving it shiny. My scalp feels better than with any of my other brushes. It wasn't very expensive and I got a comb. I am so thankful for the poison reduction, maybe I can grow my hair back out!

Hands down this hairbrush is the best. Goes right to that snarl and it’s combed without a problem. I paid $7.99 for it and money well spent. I couldn’t believe it. So inexpensive  It took only a few seconds to get my hair straight cause in the shower I come out like I have curly hair  Also there is not much hair pulled from my head. When done that brush has a couple of strands of hair in it. Before other brushes you get a ton of hair left in the brush. It’s great. Pass it on!  It’s a heavy duty wood paddle with bristles I’ve never seen before. Anyway I love it. 🥰

I know nothing about brushes. All I knew was that mine was super old and I needed $25 for free same day shipping. So, I added this brush.Before this brush, I also knew that my hair looked super dull and I attributed it to aging and was pretty bummed about it.This brush arrived and made an instant difference.First, it just made my hair smoother, and it seemed more alive. I know it sounds silly, but hey - I have no reason to lie.Second, using this (I have thicker hair) to brush through is incredibly easy compared to the old one I had (which I thought was decent).For a few $ you can't go wrong.

I bought the brush six months ago and the bristles no longer stay up.  Note I only used the brush once a week, which means it if it used daily it won't hold up for long.  But for that it is a good brush, as is massages the scalp well.

I have fine hair. Brushing when wet pulls too much and takes awhile to get the tangles out. My last brush - that I left at a hotel - was awesome. Didn’t have the same experience. This wasn’t a good replacement.  I also think the handle is too slick and thick. Not for me. I ordered something else.

The Boar bristle paddle hairbrush is easy to clean, especially with the comb that came with it.The drawbacks to the boar bristle paddle hairbrush are:1.  it smells like car tire rubber - the tips of the nylon bristles are covered with a black bead that is apparently made of car tire rubber.  This hairbrush smells really bad; it didn't smell bad at first.  Over time, the odor has become worse, to the extent that I can smell the rubber from 3 feet away from the hairbrush.2.  the boar bristles are already coming out after 2 weeks of intermittent use.It's too late to return the boar bristle paddle hairbrush.  I definitely don't recommend this hairbrush unless you like the smell of car tire rubber and don't mind the bristles falling out soon after purchasing.

I originally bought this comb for my daughters. But when you open up the package the smell is horrendous. It smells like a tire, similar to rubbery smell. The smell has not gone away. I personally am worried about that. I would not recommend this brush if the smell is not a normal smell.

Am I using this wrong? I have thick, long, wavy hair, and this brush makes my hair extremely frizzy and staticky (if brushing dry hair - ok if hair is wet).Worse than that, it collects a ton of dust! I've tried storing it in a drawer and on the counter, and both times it collected loads of dust particles that transfer into my hair while brushing. I've had to clean the dust out about five times since purchasing.If anyone else has had this issue and resolved it, please let me know. Do I need to use a special bag? I should note that none of my other items seem to collect dust like this, but it could just be that I have a dusty home.

The brush itself is nice, the bristles are great. But the smell is strong and terrible. I thought there was a bonfire in my bacthroom when I first opened it, and it just hasn't faded after a few days. I don't need to put a burnt rubber smell into my hair....definitely returning.

I bought this brush because of all the wonderful reviews. All I can say is OUCH! While it works and brushes through my hair, it is incredibly painful, the opposite of what I was looking for. My three daughters and I have long wavy/curly very thick hair. Many brushes don't have  long enough bristles to get through all of our hair even if it is sectioned out, so I gave this two stars because it does go through all of our hair - but it is so painful! We have some other brushes that work better that cost less money. I'm basically always just on the  look out for a miracle brush - looks like I need to keep looking.

I was lazy when I first received the brush, I went ahead and used it without washing it. I had just removed strands from the bristles to keep it somewhat clean (no hair build-up). I continued using the brush for almost 2 months when I decided to wash it with some dawn soap. It smelled like a barn! I was brushing my hair near my face after it was dry and noticed a strong animal poop smell. I hope it goes away. I'll update..UPDATE 7/21/2022 - Tossed out the brush after trying t o wash it a second round. The smell didn't go away.

I’m going to have to purchase another brush…Although I like the way it leaves my daughter’s hair; it’s smelly and she doesn’t like to use it. She says it leaves her hair smelly.

I have thick curly hair. I was looking for a brush that was easy for my hair with the least amount of breakage. I’ve owned this brush for about 6 months now. While I love the idea, I have 3 pets and all of the dust and clothing hairs and pet hair seems to collect in the bristles at the bottom. It’s impossible to clean. You’d have to clean each individual brush fiber and it would happen again in a week. Makes it look super gross. Tossed it today.

I used it but not happy with the brush it’s too hardThe comb is ok

I was really excited to get this brush, but I honestly felt like it was breaking my hair with every brush stroke. Plus it made my hair extremely staticky, unlike my brush I’ve had several years. It might be an amazing brush with different hair types, but I don’t think it’s a good match for someone with baby fine hair. ☹️

This is not what I expected.  It removes all of the natural oils and leaves hair a dry frizzy mess.

Seems like a great hair brush, yet I'm unsure why no one else has mentioned the smell of the brush. I didn't notice until after I brushed my hair, yet the smell was so bad that I had to wash my hair to get it out. Not sure if I should try cleaning the smell out of the brush (if possible?) or return it:/

There is really nothing special about this brush. I use my round brush chi brush to dry my hair and my big tangle teezer to straighten my hair. I tried using this brush & found it made my hair flat. Would not recommend.

I brought it days ago, but haven't used it. I open the box today and see there is only one plastic on the comb and the brushes are unpacked. And used.

Imagine the scene from princess diaries where they are trying to brush through Mia’s hair and the handle breaks while trying to brush out her hair. That is this brush….

Unfortunately, though I I initially liked this product well enough to purchase a second as a gift, the bristles have begun falling out quite often. If you don't mind buying a new brush every 9 months, you'll be fine. I will be looking for a more resilient brush for my money.

This brush was slightly smaller than I pictured.  The ability to brush hair seems fine but it smells very strongly of a rubber tire.  Imagine your hair smelling like the inside of a Firestone tire store.  Disgusting.  Hoping it’s just off-gassing that will fade over time.  I am very disappointed.

The plastic bristle bends after washed. A similar brush I bought has a stiffer stronger plastic. Doesn’t brush As well.

Love the brush but the smell is so bad I can’t use it.

The brush works fine but it's heavy to hold and so it's hard for me to brush my hair it's hard to get the tangles out of my fine hair even my four-year-old fine hair I probably wouldn't have bought this knowing how heavy it is

I returned this product.

The brush seems like a good one at first but it stinks and makes my hair stink. It smells like a dead animal. There is nasty little bits that are in the bristles that are not from my hair.  I was super excited to get it but was extremely disappointed with the brush.

Product was used for brushing my hair, seems kind of standard. Wasn’t anything special about the brush except that it was a hard product rather than being flimsy.

The plastic bristles incorporated into the Boars Hair are to long. Boars hair doesn't even touch my hair. Guess I bought a new dog brush instead.I wouldn't recommend this to men.My disappointment is already on social medea.

The bristles fall out every time I use it and I don't have thick hair. The bristles are all over my bathroom floor, so I am sure they are stuck in my hair as well. Beautiful brush set, but really disappointed that the bristles fall out.

I got this brush mainly so I could work the oils on my scalp down on more of my hair and tips but it didn't do this whatsoever :( I have pretty fine hair, maybe works for thicker hair (thought advertised for both)

I bought this for my daughter who had thick hair. She was very frustrated trying to use it while her hair was wet - it would only go through the top layer of hair.

I bought this brush on my search to find the best detangler brush for my daughters thick hair. This brush wouldn’t even go through her hair. Way to many bristles. It seems to just brush the top layer of her hair.

I’ve been using this brush for less than a month and some of the bristles are already falling out. I don’t expect it to last much longer.

I searched for an ouchless brush. This is painful to use. It is very stiff and hurts the scalp to use.

This hurts my scalp, it is a good sturdy brush but it’s not soft enough for combing from the scalp down. May work for really long hair that only needs the ends combed.

It made my hair more frizzy. Even with frizz control serums.

I use and clean this brush regularly. After a couple of weeks, it stopped combing my hair properly. It doesn't reach my scalp anymore (even after all the hair on the brush is removed)

The brush was nice for a few weeks but now I have black bristles falling out all over my bathroom.  All I’ve done is brush my hair and clean it with the comb it came with.  Will have to return.

This brush is a nice idea however my daughter's were still complaining that it was painful to brush.  We ultimately sent it back

This is a neat brush, I just used it for the first time and it didn't snag at all. But I'm quite disappointed everyone got a neat little gift but me. Poo.Will upload photos soon.

I had this product for only a month before most of the bristles fell out I am really disappointed because its a beautiful brush but its not very useful

It’s a beautiful brush but going straight from a wet brush to this one wasn’t the best transition. I have very thick tangle prone hair and unlike a wet brush that glides through my tangles, this one just pulls and tugs. The brush itself is very heavy which is nice but with the super stiff bristles, it wasn’t very comfortable to use. I think this would only work well if you brushed your hair with a different brush prior and were just using this one to redistribute your hair’s natural oils. But in any case this brush was definitely meant for the thinner haired girlies.

this distributes the oils throughout my hair so it doesn’t look so greasy, and it also makes it look silky! i never felt so much like a princess before… the thin brush is good for making my hairline straight. the bad parts about this is that the color is  removed from the wooden brush easy so dont get it in contact with water, but then how would you clean your brush? also i dont know how to clean it because of the bristles, i use a spoolie to get off all the dustballs. im pretty sure it came with a spoolie. another bad thing is that the bristled fall off easily.

This is an ok product my hair is very thick and unfortunately it makes my hair very staticy so don't use very much

ok

I absolutely loved this brush. Made brushing my hair so painless and made my hair look healthy. Only complaint, got the brush wet on accident about 2-3 months ago and after giving the brush a shampoo bath and a vinegar bath it still smells and makes my hair smell so bad.

I naturally have a more greasy scalp, and I’ve been looking for ways to maintain it, a friend recommended that I got one of these, but unfortunately I only feel like it makes it greasier and causes my hair to lose it’s curls/waves. Maybe good for other’s but not me!

Great brush just I personally didn't like the way it made my hair feel. So I went back to my wet brush.

I love this brush for my long natural curly hair but bristles are falling out after a week of daily use!

Didn’t do as good as I expected. Especially in the de tangling dept

I have thin, long hair and purchased this brush due to the high reviews and similar style to a conair that was discontinued. I’ve had it for several months and have not seen any benefits compared to another brush. Brushing out tangles is painful and the short bristles are not comfortable against my head. Might work for different styles of hair but I don’t care for it.

Works ok. Hair is a little difficult to clean

Compared to many other brushes I've owned, this one is definitely great quality. It feels great and has great brushes. It doesn't pull on my hair, and it consistently does a great job in combing my hair. However, given the wooden material as well as the mesh-like material, it does not dry well. So, if you use this on wet hair, expect it to get wet and take a while to dry. Although I've only had this for a few days, I worry, that over time, that will lead to a nasty smell. I will update here!

My hair is really thick, so pulls a lot.

I think the round ball at the end of each brush was bit too small and stiff. it feel bit uncomfortable when brushing it. could have been because. I don't have very thick hair. but when I try my the similar brush at my friends house it was much more comfortable.

5 Star to 3 StarI know you get what you pay for…but I got this at the end of August (2021) and it’s now the end of January (2022) - the thing is showing wear like you’d expect on something your grandmother owned and used every day for 40+ years. I don’t even use it every day (curly hair).It stained from hair dye (no big deal) and it looks worn, but what finally pushed me to update my review? I washed it.All the “stain” coating is flaking and crumbling off in streaks. I soaked it for ~20 minutes in warm water and a gentle cleanser soap. Previously, I’d just combed it and then tapped the build-up out…and it needed to be cleaned. Now it looks gross…The brush part is fine & works as expected still. I guess most people wouldn’t care, but I’m considering sanding it down and painting it myself 🤷🏻‍♀️

I used this brush for approximately two months, but only about twice a week.  Unfortunately, the bristles started falling out after about a month and the nubs on the ends came off, too.

Is not a good detangling brush. Wet brush all day over this

Does the trick, but I was partial to my Aveda brush that I had for years. Still, a great product, but just not the same as the other.

Too Stiff and how is this a Mens Brush as that was what i searched for.

I have very fragile hair, so upon reading reviews I decided to get this.The comb feels great, it’s soft, it untangles my hair with easy (which I always wear on a bun). I have noticed that I lose less hair when combing with this than any other comb.However! It collects dust, lots of it! And fast! I keep it in a drawer and it still collects a lot of it… which is just not cool at all, so that took one star from me. What took the other star is that it’s hard to take the dust out. So annoying that it collects dust and frustrating that it’s hard to clean and you gotta do it every day

This brush did not work well for my daughters hair, she has long thick wavy/curly hair. She cried when i used it. Although I will say she does that with most brushes. This brissles were not thick enough to go through her hair.

It was too big for my hand. I like a smaller brush.

It’s okay at first, but it’s not very high quality and it’s not easy to clean. A lot of bristles have come out.

I kinda feel like boar hair brushes are a gimmick. I tried it because I have hair that loves to tangle,  but it worked pretty much just like any hairbrush, except it's a pain in the you know what to clean out.  And if you have naturally more oily hair,  it's gonna make it that much worse.  Don't like it personally. Might be a good product for others though.

The brush is good quality, but does not get through my snarls well. I really wanted to love it. May work better on thinner hair 🤷🏼‍♀️

This is a very nice brush overall. The brush and comb arrived in very cute packaging. The wide-tooth comb is great and the brush is easy to hold. Feels nice on my head. I have noticed that the brush did have a distinct smell, most likely from the brush material (ie. nylon etc). Washing it didn't seem to help reduce the new material smell, but a couple of drops of Lavender and Rosemary essential oils made a decent improvement. Lastly, I wish the brush didn't collect dust so easily. I have lots of fine hair and clean the brush after use yet it seems that boar's hair is a magnet for dust. Typically I use the brush in the morning and before bed, what happens with dust in-between is a mystery to me. If you don't mind the cleaning maintence, it's a great brush.

The brush smells oddly smoky like a campfire and won't go away even with washing with soap and water. A few bristles started falling out when washing, and I was being fairly gentle.I love the wide tooth comb though and there was a bonus spoolie brush too which was nice.

I love the brush however does anyone else notice a weird smell from the brush? It kind of smells like wood smoke..what your clothes smell like after a bonfire. Curious if anyone else notices this?

I wish the bristles were deeper. Personally, I have very thick hair and the bristles aren't long or strong enough to really massage the back of my head in the way that I personally like. I have loose curls, with a thicker volume. Overall, it is really difficult to find the perfect hairbrush and it's going to take some time. This is the closest i've found to quality. If I could suggest to highlight the presence of the inner bristles, they would resist the deeper pull of a brush stroke. In my opinion, its an FYI tip for other consumers! Just go with your own personally likes and dislikes. It does a great job it's just not the best brush i've ever used.

Packaging was good. Once I opened the box I ran my fingers through the bristles and immediately had bristles fall off the brush. You can see on the pictures. Then I noticed the back of the brush had scratches as well and was dented and had dark scuff marks on the top corner as well. I will update my review once I try it on my hair…

This is a well made sturdy brush, it just isn't the best for my hair. I have short, natural hair that is thick. The brush had two sets of bristles. The natural boar bristles are about half the height of the plastic bristles with the nubby ends. When I brush my hair I don't feel as though the boar bristles are reaching the hair at the scalp. I think this would serve someone with longer, thinner hair or hair that tangles easily. It works nicely on wet hair. It's a good brush for some, just not for me.

I like the concept of this brush but I regret buying it. There were lots of reviewers who said it worked well for thick hair, but I just can’t see how that’s true. I don’t have thick hair and can’t get this brush through the thickest part of my hair — which is towards the back of my hair. I would NOT recommend this to someone with thick hair unless you have thinning hair.  The bristles are too dense and short. I can only get through my front scalp. I wish I could return it but I’ve used it for a few days (hoping it’d somehow get better).

The brush itself is great but it has this horrible chemical smell that is so overpowering and disgusting it makes it hard to use sometimes.

If you have a lot of hair, use a different brush to detangle your hair first before you use this one. The boar bristles cause too much drag with my hair and my wrist starts to hurt, unless I use a very firm grip and brush my hair aggressively. I'm pretty sure I have normal thickness hair and when I use this brush, it doesn't reach my scalp unless I hold the brush like a vise grip. The bristles don't go through my hair unless I hold the ends and brush against my chest. I do notice my hair has developed a nice shine, but this brush is not an efficient detangler.

Not by favorite brush but does the trick

I was just looking for pure bore Bristle and this one has a little hard plastic bristles in between. I guess that would be for wet hair? It was a little hard on my scalp

I have another boar brush. I was hoping to find a 2nd one to keep in my other bathroom. It's a nice brush but it's really heavy.

I do like the boar bristles. It gets in between hairs and detangles and adds shine to natural 4c hair type

I have very thick waves hair.  This brush does not go all the way through.  It does make my hair soft and shiny though.

It's an OK brush, nothing over the top spectacular. Just something to brush my hair with, which is what I wanted. Not as great as the description makes it out to be. Not bad either, it does the job.

The brush was great until the plastic black tops to the plastic bristles fell off . Now the brush scratches my head when I use it.

This is such a great brush doesn't hurt my head at all

I have thick hair - not curly just thick.  i like a brush that will massage my scalp too but these bristles don't feel like they ever really touch my scalp.  I have to split my hair top layer and then second layer closer to the scalp to really get through it all.  would probably not purchase again.  I do like the comb it came with though.  detangles my hair quickly and easily.

This brush is well made and good quality. If you are looking for a wide brush this will be perfect. For our needs it's just too large. Will give to a family member or friend.

Works great, but has a horrible smell. It was hardly noticeable at first, then not at all. I use a lot of dry shampoo. So, I used soap and water with a tooth brush to clean the hair product off after about a month. THE SMELL WAS HORRIBLE. Like burnt plastic/rubber.. Took about a week to wear off. I only used at night or before washing because it made my hair smell awful. Once the smell wears off, I love it. But I'm scared to wash it again because I don't want the smell to come back..

This is a well-made brush unfortunately I have short hair and it almost glides right through my hair without gaining any "traction." I gave it to my housemate. Her hair is much longer so I wanted to see if it would work for her. I heard her say, "This brush is great!" so I went to see - she was brushing my Long-Coat German Shepherd. Oh well, all's well that ends well."

I guess it will be good for long thick hair.Not for my few thin damaged hair

I love how this brush goes through my hair. But it is so hard to hold. Especially right out of the shower since that’s the only time I can brush it bc I have curly hair. Maybe if I sand the handle it will help?

The brush is good with hair brushing, and looks nice, but you have to hold your breath while you have it anywhere near your face, as it smells so bad. The plastic holding the bristles is some kind of strong smelling toxic plastic or rubber. I have boar bristle brushes and they also smell very bad when wet, but this is a toxic plastic smell.

I like the quality and price of this hairbrush . I like how it massages my head while brushing my hair and the boar bristle help me to calm down my frizzy hair a little. Overall I like to use this hairbrush.

I was looking for a nice paddle style brush for my beard and this fit what I was looking for. It would have been nice to have a less feminine one but oh well, as long as it works. The included wide tooth comb is good too. It helps detangle my long curly beard.

detangle hair

I have no complaints about the main brush. It's cute it works. The comb on the other hand was not manufactured right and has very sharp edges from the mold being slightly off.

This brush works great to get out snarls and smooth your hair. It’s supposed to stop frizz but I have found that it does nothing for my hair when it come to that. It is a beautiful well made brush that is easy to use. The bristles are not too difficult to clean and work well with my thin hair. It is a larger brush so it’s sometimes hard to use when trying to style my hair.

I have super thick hair, and this brush works okay with it.  I have other brushes that work better though.

Made well.

This brush is very pretty and well-made. It does get the tangles out. However, this is advertised as very soft, but the plastic bristles are actually pretty stiff. My tender-headed daughter doesn't like this brush. The search continues for one that works for her.

Love the way it feels, easy to clean so far. Love that  they give you a little comb and crush for cleaning.

It’s a good and sturdy brush. My hair is thick though, so the bristles are too short to penetrate the entirety of my hair. I have to make sure to brush from underneath and on top. Takes longer than my last brush.

So the brush is very sturdy, it's a nice weight it's wooden with an engraved design on it. The bristles grab the hair. It a little weird because of the rounded part against your head but it does its job. I really like it. It really brushed my hair nicely.

I really enjoy this brush.  I like the weight, the feel of the handle, and the bristles are very effective at detangling and smoothing.  The only thing is it's a bit challenging to clean.

My daughter recommended me this brush. My hair is very thick and long and it is the best brush I’ve had for detangling. Better than the Wet Brush I’ve been using for years

I use it solely as a scalp massage and it does OK in that department.  I thought it would do better with it having bristles on it.Unfortunately I have to ding it 1 star because some of the bristles ends up falling off; would have been better if the bristle were more integrated into the comb, but that may have increased the cost of the product, who knows.  But I would definitely pay more for a comb that didn't have the bristles fall off that easily with rough brushing.

I love the comb. For hair with a great cut you will see how perfectly your strands glide along thru the teeth with one pass. I was amazed, so I tried the brush right away. After years of shame over not having wrapping skills, now I know it was obviously the equipment.  This brush is a plus. I wrap without lotion, no lottabody, etc.

Good

brushes arent made as well as they were 30-40 yrs ago.  I had a boar bristle brush, wood handle. The bristles lasted 40 yrs before started to deteroiate.  (Fuller Brush)  I bought this brush to replace, even tho it handles well, the tips have nylon on the bristles- weird feeling when brushing hair/scalp, but does detangle, and brushes well down to scalp.

Works well

The brush is great but it did not come with a comb.

I really do like the brush it makes my hair feel smooth without pulling to much like other brushes! The only problem I had was the product packaging was a little worse for ware but the products inside were luckily not damaged. Overall great product.

It is very smooth gliding through the hair.One of the easier hairbrushes I've used for my fine hair, so I don't have to think much about brushing it through my strands oh-so-carefully.I also had a few of my other family members, who told me my old hairbrush (that was more like a doll brush) sucked, try it.They also gave their stamp of approval.I am pleased to have something good that I have have looking forward to getting.I will say one thing though, about a con I noticed- When my hair wasn't as moisturized as normal, it did cause a bit of static, which I'm not used to.My last brush I had for a very short time was plastic, and I used it as little as possible.The brush I had before that had wooden bristles, and did not cause static as long as I had it.So, the bristles, and the base being made of plastic still, is the only con I can really think of.Other than that, I'm satisfied, and I think I'll have this product for a long while.

I really liked the quality and wooden handle. They also included a home and another brush. It looks like it could be used for eyebrows.However, when I brush my hair, I didn’t feel like I could get the bristles onto my scalp. I have fine hair, even though it’s thick. My previous brush was not like that.

Does good at brushing your hair. Not painful on the scalp. Helps move the oils down the hair shaft. Hard to clean out though and the soft bristles come out somewhat easily. Not enough to not use it. I would say about a bristle or two every time I go to clean out the brush. Over all, a decent brush. My autistic daughter who is tender headed prefers it over my hard bristle bushes. I like to use it bc I get an oily scalp with dry ends. It helps to better distribute the oils. I have medium/thick wavy hair that is dry at the ends and tangles easily. Would definitely recommend for the price.

I originally was looking at this product for my daughters with naturally curly hair. However my husband saw it in my shopping cart and bought it for me for my birthday. I thought I’d give it a shot see how it worked in my hair. I loved it, it brushes my hair without pulling it.  I also used it on my daughters hair and they also love it because it also doesn’t pull their hair. I often find I have to go looking for my brush because my 14-year-old daughter has taken it to brush her hair.  So I am most likely going to be buying a new one here soon for all three of us to make sure I don’t have to search for a brush. I recommend this brush to anyone who has extremely curly hair, natural hair, if they’re mixed it works great it also works great on people with straight hair or wavy hair.

So far this product seems to be well made. Not sure how well the comb will work for cleaning hair putt of the brush, but that's a minor thing, and the comb itself, as a comb, is a nice extra. The brush does feel good on my scalp. The only thing I personally would change is to have the boar bristles and the plastic bristles the same height (i would have to say this about all brushes I've seen with both types of bristles). My hair being thinner means the boar bristles don't come in much contact with the hair on the top of my head to spread the natural oils from there through the rest of my hair, and the top of the head is a major spot for oil. Aside from that one detail, it does go through my hair nicely, and removes tangles better than a normal boar bristle brush, so overall I'm very happy with this product.

It brushes fine, but I couldn't stand the very strong smell. I let it air out for a very long time but it wouldn't go away. Tried washing it with soap; didn't help either. When I used it to brush my hair, the smell transfers a little bit on my hair and I couldn't stand it. Sorry, but I ended up throwing it away.

Nice wood product but pulls a lot of my hair out

While I have only been using this brush for a couple of weeks, I can say that I like this one better than the one I bought from a heavily advertised site for a comparable price and threw it away in about a month's time. Why? While it felt luxurious on my hair (just like this product), the plastic tips started to fall off after a couple of weeks -- to the point of missing the entire center section of tips w/in a month. How will this one fare? Well, so far, it's been starting to shed the boar bristles instead. Hmm. I don't brush vigorously or harshly w/ my frazzled hair so I'm going to see how much more bristle shedding this brush will be doing.

The brush is great, but I threw away the comb. It was very uncomfortable to use.

It's well made but I have super thick hair & have difficulty getting the bristles all the way through my hair.

This brush is sturdy, I really like the etched butterfly design (gotta be pretty, am I right!), the bristles are also pretty strong and the comb is great to part the hair for styling. I don't have thick curly hair. My hair air dries slightly wavey and it's a medium thickness. My ethnicity is Filipino & German, if that helps to generally understand my hair. I blow it out with a huge round vented brush to get it smooth and straight (without it being too straight like with a flat iron). I use this paddle brush to blow it straight with no bulk from the round brush (if that makes sense). Works GREAT! I have it 4 stars just because it's not vented so doing time takes a little longer. But I love it and it does what I need! It's a quality, solid brush.

I love this brush. After years of brushing my hair and trying to find ways of getting the tangles out without ripping half of my hair out, this brush is the answer. Yes, it still pulls hair some, but not nearly as much as all of the other brushes I've used over the years. I havent lost as much hair with this brush either. My boyfriend usually brushes my hair for me, and he says it is a big improvment too. The only thing he doesnt like about the brush is the handle. He says it should have a grip like a 9mm Glock, lol.

Only down side is that you have to be careful when cleaning it because the bristles can get pulled out. Otherwise, great. Works better than my $110 boars bristle brush.

I have very curly hair and this brush has been great. The bristles are dense and sturdy enough to get through my hair, but it’s also gentle and doesn’t tug out hair. I’ve noticed my hair is less frizzy after brushing, compared to other brushes. And I love that they included the comb, it’s very helpful with creating parts.I’m not sure this is the best brush for blow drying, but it may work better with thinner hair. Also, it can be annoying to clean, but I just scrub with my fingernails and it works fine. Definitely a solid 4/5.

Love the brush took 18 days too get here though

Don’t get me wrong it’s a great brush.  You may absolutely love it.  And it may be the absolute best brush for you.  However for my thin,fine hair it just didn’t work out.  I’ve kept it and maybe one day I’ll try it again.  It just gave me a lot of static and tangles.  So I’ll pass for now

Have long, thin hair and basically dreadlocks at the end of the day. This hair gets the tangles out wet or dry. I love it. One down side is it smells like a rotten animal which after a quick online search is not uncommon. Researching ways to remove the stank because I love this brush and plan to use it either way.

I bought this brush because I am postpartum right now, and losing more hair than I normally would. I wanted to get a better, detangling brush and this does that and more! It is SO good at calming down frizz, and as a bonus, waaaay easier to clean. The wife tooth comb it comes with functions well to rid the brush of hair. Best part is the price. 😁Only two complaints—I didn’t know it had a butterfly on it and that sent my favorite. Not the cutest in my opinion lol And the fine bristles shed a little at first but stops eventually.

Bought this but gave it to my Daughter as I didn't really like it as much as the Shash.  You can't use Boar Bristle Brushes when your heair is wet because it will pull it out.  Not bad value for money but would buy Shash in preference to this.

When I first received this product, I was attracted by the behind butterfly. It is elegant symbol likely. So it is not cheap product I can feel. The only thing I feel don’t like is when I start to try it, I saw pieces of grey hair thing hang on this brush. It gives the feeling like it is not brand new one. Someone maybe tried it before. But it is fine, cause I don’t want to waste my time to do an exchange. Then I tried it on my children’s hair, it looks nice. So I want to keep it now.

So I got this brush to help spread out the abundance of oil my hair produces, but unfortunately my hair is thin enough that the boar bristle don't really touch my scalp thanks to the longer bristles. It does seem to help what hair it does touch, but if you have thinner hair I would suggest a different style. It's also possible I'm using it wrong.

Came in a nice box with a comb and spooly for cleaning. It’s a hairbrush, it does its job. Nothing earth shattering to this review. Seems to work fine for long hair.

I like the boar bristles and nylon pins in this brush with the wooden handle it is easy to hold and use. I have naturally curly hair that I like to blow dry straight and this brush works well for this, as it really helps to grab the baby hairs nicely. But there is a very strong smell to this brush, likely both the rubber base and I think initially the boar bristles have a smell to them. I hope that I can get the smell to wash out eventually. Not a fan of the smell.Overall, this is a nice brush.

I have thin curly hair that horribly sheds with any and all of the other brushes that I have tried. Since receiving this brush I find a better grip on the handle, there is very little shedding and the brush does not pull my hair out.The base of the brush where the bristles are is made of a durable but gentle material that does not cave in.I have hair that tangles easily and this brush makes detangling easier and gentle "No more Ouch!!) I gave it an 8only because I want to see the duration of wear and tear over time.

I air dry my hair, all I can say is probably the best brush and comb I have ever owned, really!

I've only had for a couple weeks...Though the boar bristles do not feel authentic, so far this brush works like they do. The bristles feel plastic and the brush had a chemical smell at first. But my oily scalp it seems was just me not knowing I needed this brush. The boar bristles spread the oil evenly over the entire length of hair making it softer and shinier all over. I'm one to wash my hair every three to four days for the "health" of it and it's been looking better than it has in a long time! So far it's a great buy.

I really wanted a boar bristle hair brush because it's so much better for your hair and scalp than using a brush with plastic bristles. Unfortunately, this doesn't go all the way through my hair. Trying to get all my hair brushed is kind of a workout. My hair isn't Super thick but I feel this is perfect for someone with thin hair. I went back to using my Conair plastic brush because it was easier and did a better job.

Have been using the brush and comb for about five months now and the only complaint is that the sealant is coming off the back of the brush. No bristles are bent or missing and my wife uses as well.

Gentle on hair makes it soft and creates slight sheen. Does not cause breakage. Love it.

I struggle so hard with my daughter’s thin, wavy, dry, tangly hair. This has helped so much. When literally no other brush can get the tangles out, it does the trick. She hates it because it pulls a bit, but I think that’s necessary to get the job done. Will buy again if anything happens to it. I also love that it’s wood and not plastic!

I’ve always thought a brush is just a brush, this can’t be that different. I stand corrected. This is the best brush I’ve ever used in my 50 years of existence.  I dont feel any pulling on my scalp, no sound of hair breaking when going through knots. Highly recommend this brush.

I’ve never had a boar bristle brush before, so I was shocked by how smooth it made my hair! Honestly it made such an instant difference. HOWEVER. THE SMELL. I happened to brush my hair while it was damp and afterward it smelled LIKE A PETTING ZOO! I looked online and apparently it’s not uncommon with boar bristle?! I followed online directions and used pet shampoo to wash it multiple times in an effort to get rid of the smell. I’m unsure if I will use it again. Before I realized the brush smelled terrible I loved it.

I had seriously matted hair and I’m super tender headed with thin hair. This brush untangled my hair easier than any brush I’ve ever used. I was skeptical at first since all others have failed me but this one was legit. I definitely recommend this product.

It's actually better than i thought! Not painful at all haha

Great brush for curly easily tangled long hair.

Even with think hair it doesn’t hurt. It takes a few brush strokes working firm tip to root and it’s every bit as good as my old mega expensive one maybe even better.  It’s a breeze to clean up as well.  As a hair stylist for 20 years I highly recommend. Lovely packaging, little card for tips and the big comb- makes a fantastic gift for anyone.  Especially for yourself. Enjoy

Bought this hairbrush for a relative in a nursing home who is extremely fussy ( I can’t use the word I want to say on Amazon).  She’s an absolute diva about her hair and she liked it. She wanted another brush that cost about four times as much but amazingly we received no complaints about this one.

Boar bristle brushes are so great for hair and scalp health. I have extremely long fine hair so it’s always so tangled. I have used wet brushes in the past and they always break. This brush feta goes better and leaves my hair silky and soft. I will never buy another brand of brush again. The comb that came with it perfectly pulls out the hair stuck in the brush. Love, love, love this brush

Besr brush I’ve ever owned.  I have thick hair and this baby doesn’t job. Get knots out without tearing my hair and is able to get to bottom layer of my hair without me sectioning it off.

Great hair brush!

It’s very affordable, cute, and works so well. Love you guys may God hardcore bless you

Finally found a brush that works!My daughters and I have thin hair but always end up with horrible tangles and knots.This brush is the first brush that works through the tangles with ease. Honestly love it.

Better than expected, I am satisfied.

My husband kept using my brush so I bought another one for him. Great price and it comes with a cleaning comb.

we love the hair brush we have two of the one for me and one for my daughter we ever in carved so we would know whose was whose u can use it wet or dry great buy  i would recommend

This brush just feels so good! Loves the scalp massage.

I love this brush set. I brush my hair more often than before and it is easy to clean.

I loved this set will buy again

Great quality! You won't be disappointed.

I used this on a little one who always has tangled hair. She loves this because it doesn't hurt her head when brushed.

My hair is currently braided so I can’t use it but when I take them out this is definitely going to be my go to brush I used to have one years ago but I lost that one lol

Remember when we would watch western movies and there would be a scene where the women would be brushing her hair one hundred times before going to bed??? Well this is that brush. Feels like a massage.

Great quality. Love the way it feels on my scalp.

Both are lovely and have soft bristles that do their job. Highly recommended. Used these on vacation. Exactly what we needed.

Great to make my hair shine and look sleek. The comb is perfect to achieve my hair styles effortless or detangle areas that need it.

Love the handle and how easy it is to use.  It works pretty well. Does not pull on hair and it’s very pretty. It can be use while blow drying your hair or just to brush it at any time of day. Love the bristles. Very gentle on head and hair.

This is the best hairbrush I’ve ever owned. My hair is short and wavy. It smooths out my hair making it soft and manageable.

Very nice brush detangled hair brush and comb plus a gift for free because I did not order an extra comb but I enjoy it thank you does not hurt to brush hair no more.

So perfect! Cute brush

Best combo of boars hair and acrylic bristle brush. Love it. Attractive and functional. I feel like The boars hair smooths while the acrylic bristles detangle the occasional knot. This combined with the Money Mask.  Winner.

Worked so well for my fine hair that is cut into a bob . I want another for my purse.  It also feels wonderful on my scalp ,not too hard but does the job .

The appearance it’s good and works good

Great quality! Very durable! Love this little set!

Really good brush for my long and think hair.  Less breakage than with synthetic bristles.

Love this brush and how it makes my hair look!!

Daily use and this thing still had the rubber caps on the bristles.

This brush is amazing. It makes my hair so soft. I also use to struggle with dandruff but not since switching to this brush.

I cannot opine on tangles or long locksFor shortish hair however, this rocksNice to look at, and all natural5 stars seems quite rationalYour hair shan't be sacrificedWith this brush so well pricedComes with a comb as wellA thoughtful thing so swellRecommendation for this brushForthcoming in a rush

Cannot live without this brush, I love it

We wanted a Boar brush for my husband’s thick hair.However, on thick hair 100% Boar will just sit on top of it not getting through to scalp. So we opted for this mixed Boar bristle with nylon bristle. He loves it as well as the weight of it. It leaves his hair shiny and smooth.

I bought the Scala brand body brush about 3 years ago and loved it. Use it wet or dry and never had issues, it was the first one I’ve bought. Well the plastic finally cracked on it and the bristles started falling out. I decided to buy this one bc it was overnight shipping and looked the same but when it arrived, it went right back to the box for return. The wood is thinner the bristle chunks are gapped and soft and it was obviously lesser quality for about the same price. I will stick with scala. My new Scala vs. popchose for comparison

okay i really liked this brush at first and used it every time i exfoliated but i recently noticed after coming back from a 2 week vacation when i went to use it that it had grown moldy. i am so upset and disappointed. this is absolutely disgusting. is this normal to happen??? i am so confused on why it happened so suddenly, i assumed its because i hadn’t used it but still that shouldn’t have grown mold so quickly

The box and the Amazon description says natural Boar bristles. I’ve owned at least 10 boar bristle body brushes over the past 20 years. I know the difference between natural, actual boar hairs  and shiny, flimsy plastic bristles.Synthetic bristles are not beneficial for dry brushing. They damage the skin with minuscule tears that can then get infected or bumpy.BUYERS BEWARE

The Ad says, "Stiff," which I thought that I was getting. It's definitely on the "Soft" side. It becomes much softer when wet; however, it's "not soft enough" to use on my face,  "a little "Harsh' on facial skin.  Definitely it's way too soft to clean nails/toes. I regretted buying them because I cannot think of any ways to repurpose it,  I have no use for it at all.

I thought the bristles would be harder.

Was soft bristles. Description led me to believe it was a stiff/course bristle scrub brush. Quality looks good but did not fit my needs.

As you can see from the photos it appears the box should be a tanish color yet mine has black stuff all over it. It seems like the box was possibly opened or just came damaged.

The wood handle likes to collect mildew and mold. Imngoing to try to sand it out.

It’s nice, but it already cracked within a week.

This brush is does not work. The bristles are too short and flexible for effective dry brushing of the skin. I was swayed by the low price and now I know why it’s so cheap.  Do not recommend buying.

I bought it after I saw it’s rating, may be mine one manufacturer defect- I’m not using it anymore

The brush's bristles are not thick / close enough, soap disappears easily from water, will NOT buy again.

I bought this product after a massage therapist taught me how to use it. I have only used it twice and there are 2 holes now where bristles use to be. These bristles are not secured properly. Only but if you plan on replacing often.

It broke and now has a nail showing.  Unable to use

I have been dry brushing my skin for years (with natural bristle brushes)… as much as I wanted to love this brush I just hate it. The bristles are so soft I couldn’t even feel it doing anything no matter how hard I brushed. One use and it’s in the trash can.

The brush is very nice; however, there was no hook included in the packaging as was advertised

I got this item due to its reviews. When I opened the package, some of the bristles were already falling off but figured that was normal. I used a very light touch/pressure like the directions stated and by the end of me using it, most of the bristles fell off. I heard they’re supposed to last months but that unfortunately was not the case.

It hasn’t even been 30 days and I’m already throwing this brush away. One side is dented in and I can’t figure out how. This is completely trash.

I don’t like the fact that is not firm enough and not big enough…. I had gone to a spa and I loved the results so I decided to buy me one. Pretty disappointed.

Worst body brush I have purchased. Very few bristles that starting falling out during 1st use. Baby fine, short bristles, my loofah scrubbed better. I'm so disappointed.

I received an EMPTY box, so I can not review this product properly. But, the box is nice and sturdy!

This product gave me a strange reaction on my body and I am too scared to use it after the 2 times I did. I still have problems!

I thought I was buying a repeat product and clearly not!  This product bristles are so light and not thick.  It is a cheap version of the other one I bought.  I am returning.  It looks like it is a balding brush and cheaply made....very disappointed.

I missed the return window on this, but it is terrible. Bristles are so flimsy and do nothing for dry skin brushing.

I used this brush one time and the bristles just crushed down to the point the brush cannot be used again.  Absolutely not worth the money.

Bristles falling out and getting stuck in my skin.  Go with another brush

Tons of bristles fell out the first time I opened it.  Asked for a refund, was sent another instead and was a hassle trying to return.  One I could take to Kohl's but the other I needed to use an Amazon locker and print/pay for a label.  The second brush had the same quality issue.

Tried to use it in mu front door but it does not work

Super disappointed. Fiest one I got was full and it was hard like boar bristles should be. The 2nd one I just ordered was so bare and the bristles are too soft it doesn't exfoliate!! It feels like a brush you use on a newborns hair!

Upon using this item on my body I have to say I felt so uncomfortable. It hurt from the first moment I used it on my arms. Very rough. Returning.

Caution: I bought this brush thinking it would help with swelling after major surgery. Within 24 hours of use, I was admitted to the hospital with a horrible skin infection. I was on IV antibiotics for 4 days. The doctors say I’m not out of the woods yet. Needless to say, I threw away the brush once I got home.

I don’t know what happened. But I ended up getting a rash all over my body after dry brushing with this.

I just received this brush and instantly disappointed by the cheap feel and look of the brush. Just pulled it out of the box and bristles are everywhere, I barely touch it and they’re falling off the brush. Returning…

I bought this for my KP with high hopes. DO NOT BUY FOR KP. I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES. THIS IRRITATED MY SKIN EVEN MORE AND THE BRISTLES STARTED COMING OUT.

I purchased this body brush March 25, 2022.  I used it a couple of times a week.  The handle is too wide/loose which makes it difficult to use.  Then on May 17th, 2022 the handle broke.  Not worth your money.

Update: seller has been harassing me over six months to change my reviewI’ve used dry brushes for years and this is by far the lowest quality I’ve seen. It arrived with loose bristles everywhere, and they just keep falling out - the second photo shows what two light passes over my hand left behind

It’s already starting to detach from wood. It’s not even 2 weeks. Don’t buy. I’ll remove this comment when I get a new one. So annoying. These cheap China companies just send crap

Quality isn’t great. Seems very cheap/lightweight and much smaller than expected

This was definitely soft enough for sensitive skin, but tons of bristles were falling out when trying to use it. Not worth it.

This product is amazing. It is easy to hold while exfoliating your skin. The bristles are firm but comfortable on my skin. I use it at least 3-5 times a week A very good product for many uses at a reasonable cost.

I used this exfoliating dry brush twice.  It gave me a skin infection. After a trip to urgent care, I was on Keflex and prednisone for 10 days.  The brush went in the trash.  Do not purchase this item.

This brush is very poorly made. When I opened the package the bristles started coming out of the brush. Also, the brush is extremely too soft.  It's also smaller than most brushes I have used. I would not recommend this particular brush for body bushing.

This brush is a joke.  It is not natural bristle. It is too soft to be affective.  It is really good for nothing.Some if the bristles fell out when I removed it from the cellophane bag .

I just received this Popchose dry brush. The box was crushed when it arrived. When I opened the brush, there was a green larvae/worm crawling across the brush. Pretty disgusting, especially for a personal hygiene product.

I don't know why this has so many stars. The bristles are sparse to begin with, but it sheds them like crazy. I've only been using it for 2 minutes and I already have a small pile of bristles.

this brush was ok. the bristles were to hard for my sensitive skin. and I stuck the hanging holder on the wall right by the shower and ripped my drywall so I am not very happy!

It’s soft and the bristles shed a lot. One brush and it sheds more than a dog. I won’t last me very long.

Do not buy this is pure garbage and a waste of money and product

The worst brush i ever seen so cheap looking and the bristal not as i expected or even the review.I guess we cannot all time trust the review🤔🤔🤔disappointing

Brisles too soft handle  too loose 😔Brush so little

The first order cracked and they sent me a replacement. The second one became moldy soon after use. I have used other body brushes and the wood base has not turned black and moldy. Won't buy again although the bristles are soft.

I tried this once and that was it.  I now use a piece of wood designed for lymph movement and muscle massage.

I purchased this to use as an exfoliating brush for elbows, knees, ankles, etc. I don't have calloused or rough skin, but do use sunless tanner in the summer months and wanted to exfoliate these areas to keep the tanning solution from collecting in those areas.After only 2 uses, the bristles are nearly flattened, and the brush was poor at exfoliating the skib as well. The bristles are not firm enough to be effective, even on  more tender areas.

It hurts so much , they saying it’s soft it’s not it hurts on my skin , so what’s the benefit getting this brush if it hurts

A bit disappointed, bristles shed terribly and very small. Not very good for it’s purpose…

This brush is incredibly rough & feels terrible on your skin. It’s sturdy and appears well-made but maybe for other things. Might be good on rough feet but that’s about it.

I expected the bristles to be soft but stiff. What I got was soft bristles falling out of the handle. Nice packaging thoughUpdate:While I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the product, I am quite happy with POPCHOSE's customer service. They reached out, apologized and refunded my money. Nice to know they're paying attention to their customers' concerns. So while this product didn't work for me, I won't shut the door on doing business with them again

I would’ve preferred something stronger, this is good if you have really sensitive skin since the exfoliation level I would say would be 1 out of a scale of 5

This may be a great tool as it looked like it would work, however I noticed a few bristles loose. I read the instructions which said each one was hand packed into the brush, therefore to expect some to come out. I didn't open it and lightly brushed my finger across the top outside of the package. At that point I realized if I used it I would end up with empty holes in the brush as they were coming loose.I am sure it's great for some people. I was just afraid of having more bristles in the tub than in the brush.Very nice handle and wood.

This is advertised as natural bristles, however, the bristles appear to be plastic?

I think this is a great product only one problem in my view, the bristles are too soft. Not good as an body/skin exfoliater.

My last dry brush was so nice. This one is super rough my hurts my skin. Do not like it at all.

The bristles layed down after a few uses in the shower.  So I have a flat spot in the middle of the brush. Lasted about 2 weeks

this brush should cost half (current price = $10) as much as it does.  It is not junk but rather middle of the road I guess.  Bristles are cheap synthetic and sparse.  It is fine for light duty I suppose but as an everyday driver I do not think it has the goods.  In short, not garbage but not enough either.

This is not what I was looking for since I prefer a stronger bristle. This is good for first time users.

The bristles needs to be a tad softer, I have had to go out and buy another one I could actually feel and it works perfect! I’d suggest to buy in a store Not Online!

Bristles way to soft to do the job that I needed

AFTER SO LONG THE BRISTLES LAY DOWN. WAS NOT A FAN

I was very disappointed in this item. The bristles bent and stayed bent after only three uses. Too few bristles.

Originally I purchased an eco tools dry brush and I loved it. I purchased it almost two years ago and it’s time to replace it. I decided to try a different brush and purchased the popchose brush. It looks nice but isn’t as rigid as the ecotools one, which I feel needs to be rigid to live up to its claims. This item fell short for me so I’m returning

I could not tell the size of this brush but thought it would be at least larger than my palm. It is not. Small. Does not seem well made.

I’ve purchased like 3 of these within last couple years and I was very happy with the two previous orders, but the last brush I got has very soft bristles and it’s pretty much useless and doesn’t serve the purpose (can’t exfoliate anything). Not sure what happened to the quality here, but it’s like a completely different product now. I’m going to order from another brand now.

The bristles are honestly just ok, seem to fall out easily and don’t really exfoliate as expected.

Packaged arrived like it was repackaged. Brush looks used. Bristles are extremely soft. Didn't feel like I was exfoliating anything.

First use, the bristles were falling out. Nice grip and handle but not as great as I thought based on prior reviews!

Look for a higher quality brush.  It is cheaply made didn't expect that much plastic on a wooden brush.  It is  smaller than I thought it would be so it's hard to hold and  the strap is thin.

I hoped for it to do something but I noticed nothing. No difference. My cellulite is the same. My skin was maybe softer though.

This brush doesn’t seem to be very high-quality, and the bristles are synthetic. False advertising.

I liked this very much for first few days. But using it after 10 days and this is one of the worst brushes.Scratches up my skin and the bristle is getting torn away after each use .Don't recommend it.

Its easy to hold but to soft to really  do any good esp if your wanting exfoliate. Which is what I bought it for. Im looking for something like it with much firmer bristles.

This brush started to mold after two weeks. The bristles are very stiff and painful.

The delivery was prompt, but I didn't like the quality of the bristles.

It scrubs, but it's untreated wood so keeping it in a damp shower environment can result in mold growth. I'd recommend looking for something made of treated wood or a plastic.

This was a good brush although the bristles were very hard. It was too hard for me to use on my skin.

Bristles wear down in no time.  Hate to contribute to trash.  Otherwise love the feel.

It’s too soft to have real exfoliation

This item would be perfect if it stopped shedding. It is easy to hold and leaves my skin soft but the bristles keep falling out.

Very soft.  Not as effective as other stiffer brands at removing dead skin

Very rough bristles that gave me a light burn after my first shower, only use it on my feet now.

No results using it. Wouldn't buy again

Not what I expected from the descriptionThey did respond and refunded my money. Good customer service follow up.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT LITERALLY MESSED UP MY SKIN!!!

I used the brush one time, I kid you not – and the strap broke off. The brush itself feels nice but overall, cheaply made. Look elsewhere.

Received this today and tried it out. The bristles are too soft, so it did nothing at all.

It looks nice and comes with a handy hook to hang in the shower, which is a great touch. However, the bristles are a bit too aggressive for my skin and tend to feel irritating during use. If you prefer a softer scrub, this might not be the best option. Otherwise, it's functional and well-made.

something difficult to judge stiffness online. I will say I didn't find it as stiff as my last brush purchase . I was hoping for something stiffer....I won't be buying this brand again.

Although other reviews mentioned how soft the product is, it is harsh on my skin. I don't have sensitive skin, so I was surprised to find the brush so abrasive that it left marks on my skin. The brush looks well-made and easy to use.

Good

I was looking for a harder bristle dry brush, this one didn’t make the cut.

Brush bristles not strong enough for dry brushing. Good as a fingernail washing brush.

Wood split down the center in less than a month. Not sturdy

It’s perfect for me. Not to hard, not too small and right size. The only issue was a bristle fell after the first couple of uses. When I checked, it looked like there were two or three holes with bristles completely missing. I don’t know if they fell off or they were never their. Either way, it’s a good brush. Even with the defects, I would give it a 3.5 if I could

Maybe I expected the brush to actually scrub my skin, where you could tell the difference. It doesn't. I got this one to replace my previous one, thinking this one would give my the same feeling of clean new skin and the old scrubbed off. But onçe the soap hit the brush, it became soft. If you like soft brushes, this would be good for you.

This brush is packaged nicely but cheaply made. I lost 3 bristles in 5mins. The brush also smells weird like it’s been sitting in an old perm box for a few years. Searching for more options

Not for me! But seller is professional and customer friendly!! Thank you!

Bristles are not very coarse and brush is definitely for more sensitive skin. Still feels good, but not the results I had hoped.

My last brush that I was using was much easier on the skin.  I don't know yet if this one will get better.  I have only used it twice.

Too soft. Bristles not firm or rigid enough, but can see product is made well.

Not the most enjoyable. The brush is very rough.

Maybe I haven't used it long enough to really say whether or not it works. So far I haven't noticed a difference, but I'm going to keep going for a while longer before I give it a no.

It’s ok

Brush is ok, I would like the bristles to be a little harder.

Just too soft to be effective

Not what it was advertised as being…it is not for lymphedema…to rough on the skin.

Maybe I’m sensitive but this brush is too hard for me. Nicely made other than that but returning to find a softer bristle

I wanted to write a review in case you are someone who has sensitive skin. I do, and while I did research prior to purchasing this brush, it still resulted in an all-over body rash that took me to the dermatologist to get a steroid shot. I think the product works exactly how it is supposed to, just wanted to post a review in case you are someone with sensitive skin - use less frequently than suggested and apply less pressure than suggested. If you experience any discomfort, back off or avoid that area. You may not be able to use it the way it is described in the instructions or when you research online. Prior to rash beginning 3 works into me using the brush, I DID experience the benefits of smoother skin plus the added bonus of increased circulation, I just did not use it in the way it was best for me. Do your research and start slow to see what feels right!

I think I will love it, although it did not come with a user manual.

Really exfoliates well, made my skin feel soft after the shower. Always felt clean while scrubbing.Holding it was difficult. My hands are small and this is kinda clunky, a little awkward and uncomfortable sometimes.The wood itself withers away and peels after several showers. It blackens and feels rough at the touch. After a month or two, you'll need to buy another one, or an entirely different scrubber in general.Overall, it's okay!

this brush is great for delicate areas of skin like your chest but I was specifically looking for something to help exfoliate my legs. this was too soft for that and I ended up buying a different brush that works better in helping prevent ingrown hair and bumps

You get what you pay for I guess. Just over a month after purchase (one month and ten days), the plastic cracked and the tufts of bristles started to fall out. Convenient, just after I couldn't return it. Avoid this one. Quality is crap. I have used other brushes for years. This one lasted one month with regular use. I hate manufacturers who spawn crud on the public. Don't give your money to this one.*Update: seller reached out to give a refund. I hope they will create a higher quality product instead, but I am glad they at least are willing to refund those who's brush fell apart.

The bristles are harder than I like. I've been skin bruising for 6 years and this is my 3rd brush. It's significantly harder than the other two.

A lot more harsh than expected! I wanted something to obviously exfoliate but this seems to be scratching more than helping. The only place I can really stand to use it is on my legs. I'll do that before I shave and that helps but its painful to use anywhere else. Even my husband can hardly handle it. It came with a hook to stick in the shower so that it doesn't sit wet which is helpful because the material handle definitely needs to dry.

I've used it for 5 days and the bristles are already shedding. I'm wondering how long until it's sparse. Hopefully, only a few fall out. The little hanger doesn't hold it that well. Other than that, I do like it.

The brush was easy to hold and the brush was much gentler to the skin than I had imagined.  I didn’t see much progress to the sketch mark as I had hoped.Update: The customer service after-sales team was very responsive and we've had a productive conversation about how to make the brush better.  Thank you for responding so quickly to address my concerns.

Nice size, easy to hold.  The bristles are easily worn down and then the brush needs replaced regularly.

The brush is nice. I got hooked on natural bristle body brushes while living in Germany where they are popular. However, this brush is much softer than most of the German brushes. I would have liked this brush to be a bit stiffer, but it is fine. Just a matter of taste. Some of the bristles have also fallen out which makes me question the overall quality.

Decent product. Wasn't the firmness I was wanting for exfoliation. Very soft instead.

The brush is difficult to hold (I frequently drop it while I use it because the strap is so loose it slips out of my hand), and when it arrived there were so many loose bristles that I spent a few minutes shaking them out. I’m satisfied with the product otherwise, but I wish the strap was adjustable or easier to keep a hold of, and that the bristles were more resilient.

Bristles too soft. But does the well! Feels good like a rub down!!

I bought this because of reading an article about the benefits of dry brushing. I’ve used this brush only a handful of times but haven’t seen a dramatic impact either way. The product itself is quality made. I can’t say either way if I’ve noticed a major difference in my skin feeling different or my health over all from exfoliating the skin with this brush... Either way great product to get it you swear by dry brushing.

Not as firm as i would have liked it! Pretty soft actually

I do like this body brush. However, it sheds a lot. Every time I brush it does shed. Granted, the brush does come with a warning of shedding and how to prevent shedding from happening. It’s still a bit inconvenient. But, it does get the job done and comes with a little hook, where you can leave it in a safe place and make sure it does not get contaminated.

I like this brush very much for exfoliating. If you use a self-tanning product and regular use of this dry brush, you will be scrubbing that tan away. I tried to build a tan over a couple weeks and the brush defeated the purpose in the end. Maybe I should have expected that.

I use this brush in my spa services to exfoliate skin and encourage good blood flow. The bristles are not rough on the skin. It’s not too soft either. Just the right amount for skin exfoliation. This is to be used dry.Only negative remark I have is that the bristles keep falling out a little at a time with each use.

The bristles were softer than other brushes I've used. I didn't find it as effective as brushes with harder bristles

I bought this as a dry brush to increase circulation.  I have only been using it for a week or so, have not noticed any results just yet, but the brush is a good size, easy to hold and the bristles are soft and feel like they are 'pampering my skin'.  For the price, it's worth a shot!

This made me super itchy the hours after the first time I used it.

i kinda like the durability of this product but what i don't like is the bristles are really hard and it scratch and leave your skin red. you will feel that you remove all the dirt but also kinda feeling of having your skin removed as well. Maybe something that they could improve.

Mine did not come with the hook

The brush itself is nice, but there are a few issues. Some hairs are way longer than the others, so I needed to trim them. Also the strap is HUGE! I cannot hold it in an easy way without it sliding everywhere. I have no clue whose hand could possibly be that big.

I have been using this brush for about a month now. I have not not noticed any results when it comes to cellulite. However, it does leave my skin fairly soft. Will continue to use this to see if there are any long term results and will update the review as needed.

I did not like that the handle strap is loose for my hands when using the  brush. It would slip often,however I do love the size of the brush and it's very soft. It works as it should and I do plan to order another one.

Wood cracked but still usable. Works well but cant do my back.

Within the first couple of short but vigorous uses of this brush I noticed that the dry skin on my elbows and upper arms was almost entirely gone and my skin is now so soft and smooth that I don't even put lotion on my arms anymore! What is this madness and where has it been all of my life?!I previously tried dry brushing on my face (different product; same concept) because my acne-prone daughter had such good luck with it and was so convinced that I'd love it that she bought one for me. She was right! I'm 56 now and for the past five years or so I have been struggling with little bumps on my face that wouldn't respond to topical products. Dry brushing once every day or two with a $10 dry brush took care of 80% of the problem within a couple of weeks, after having spent hundreds of dollars on multiple types of cleansers and lotions over the previous five years, none of which ever made more than a 20% impact.This body brush worked even better, with near 100% success on my arms. I haven't yet attacked my dry legs with it but I have high hopes. For now, I'm very happy to just be less self-conscious than I was when my upper arm and elbow skin were so dry. I love not having to use lotion on them!Even though the face brush was not this product or by this brand, I brought it up to make a point. If you have persistently dry or bumpy skin on any area of your body, giving a dry brush a try isn't likely to make anything worse. I mean, you're already miserable with it, so worst-case scenario is that you're still miserable and you're only out $10 instead of the hundreds of dollars you've probably spent on "miracle" skin treatments, as I had. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because something about the shape or hand strap doesn't work optimally for me. Very small downfall when compared with the results.

I prefer my original that Amazon no longer carries. This brush is probably stiff enough for most people, and certainly less expensive than the one I misplaced while moving. I use it.. it works.. just not as well as a very stiff brush. I can pictures this one eventually flattening out.

I like that it is small and fits in my hands good

This brush is very solid and seems to be made from quality material, but I'm not the biggest fan of using it for exfoliation. It's a little rough to use on my whole body, but it works great for scratching my back and legs! I like to use this as more of a scratcher/massager before putting on lotion. I am a big fan of the handle on the back though, makes it easy to hold onto when I'm scratching my own back.

The bristles are a little rough, but I’m sure will get better with use! It came with a little adhesive hook to make it easy to hang up and store! Super durable and strong handle on it!

Great for dry brushing, leaves your skin soft. The brush itself is not too harsh, it's soft but not too soft, just perfect!

Brush is too small for my hand.

First dry brush I’ve ever had so not sure what to expect. Wood brush head and handle seem good quality. Bristles are scratchy though and I actually kind of avoid using it. My skin is sensitive so I’m not sure if this is common/normal/good. 🤷‍♀️

pretty good, nothing special

Used for my legs

The brush works well for what it’s supposed to do. But the bristles are very hard, much more than I expected for something to be used on your body.

It's too soon to see any results just yet, but great impression so far! The instructions sent in the package did say to expect some bristles to fall out during the first few uses, which I've definitely noticed. My only "complaint" is that the bristles are a little too soft, at least when I'm using it in the shower. The hot water softens them, and they're only going to get softer as I continue to use it. Personally, I prefer my brushes on the rougher side, so anyone with sensitive skin has come to the right place!It's just the right amount of firmness when used dry though, so I may get a second one just for that.

Very nice.. would have liked it a little bigger

I wanted to try after doing some reading and looking at YouTube. Did more research and decided not to try it. My husband couldn’t get his hand under the strap so not so good for a man with large hands. The bristles felt hard to the touch looks well made but I returned.

Works well

The dry brush looks exactly like the picture and seems to work well. My skin is very soft after using it. My only gripe is how much it sheds bristles. I don't know if this is normal or not.

I really like this brush. The bristles aren’t too hard but us actually comfortable. I only use the brush when I bathe and not on my dry skin. My skin was pretty darn soft after the first use. I use the brush approximately three times a week because I don’t want to overdo the routine and possibly harm my skin.  However, my skin is actually softer and smoother. It’s too soon to see the results of combating cellulite, but it is kind of working on this issue. I would recommend this brush.

I did a review on this product already! It's great- look for my review for details. I bought two, so it's automatically asking me for another review.

The last one I had crumbled and cracked and didn't last long hope this one last longer it's a really good exfoliator on the skin

This is so soothing and my skin did feel softer, but at the end of the day it's not necessary.

I just wish it was a little rougher, it’s kinda soft haha

Good product

With gentle pressure this brush works well, notified smoother skin immediately. The only thing I would fix is the little hook it came with to hang does not work very well, so I’d use a different hook for more stable storage. The band is good for my petite hand, but might not be comfy for a bigger hand and isn’t stretchy.

This brush came promptly and packaged well. It is stiffer than I expected but works well. It even came with its own hanger.

The Bristles started coming out. This was not the product for me but they’re really good. The company I mean and have a great return policy, so try it out to see if it’s something that maybe you would like just wasn’t for me.

UPDATE: After seeing my review and my dissatisfaction with the brush, the company POPCHOSE reached out and gave me a full refund. Hooray! Good customer service does still exist.My last dry scrub brush had many more bristles and was firmer. This brush is okay, probably good for sensitive skin. I like the firmer bristles, it did some serious exfoliating. Nothing wrong with this brush. I just prefer the firmer one as I feel I got better results.

I’ve been dry brushing for 30 years.  This is good, but could have harder bristles.  Perhaps for someone just starting this would be really good to get used to the process.

Great brush! It’s lasted me over 2 years. I do not use it everyday though. The reason for the 4 stars is that it’s a little soft.

My skins very soft with this

It has quite gentle bristles,  quality is good, and doesn't scratch the skin much, but it's not thick so it feels it's not doing much, though it's very good starting point for people who are new to dry brushing.

The salt shaker holes were to big

I got it due to all the hype around it, thinking it would do something to my skin. After watching a lot of videos on it, I used it in the shower because I was “going to have a lot of dead skin”.  Well now I’m not too sure who had more dead skin the brush or me. The brush at the FIRST use was already shedding and it sheds quite a bit. Maybe it was the one I got I’m not sure but it left a lot of brush hairs on my tub. I would get it maybe for the price but I think you can probably find something better at tj maxx or something.

I use this to exfoliate the dry skin on my legs before applying self tanning lotion, it is very forgiving while doing a great job, gentle but effective, I would recommend.

Works better with lotion or massage oil. But still a bit stiff/rough on the skin. Feels sturdy

I think the bristles could be more firm to get better results but it still gets the job done and is my go to repurchase.

I bought this body brush because I sometimes have itchiness after I shower even though I moisturize. Also wanted to get rid of leftover dead skin that may remain. I didn't want an exfoliator cream/gel because everyone says they have micro-plastic.This is my first body brush and to be honest it did kinda hurt when I first used it. I started off mostly doing my calf, elbows, and knees because those were less sensitive areas. However, waiting for the warm water to soften the bristles did help. They do not fall out consistently, but every so often (like once every 2 weeks if that) a bristle will come off. Now I am used to the brush.After using this brush for a few weeks, I can say that I like it and I do use it when I shower every day. I don't know if it necessarily made my super smooth because I didn't have 'rough' skin to begin with, but I did feel a little softer after using it. I would be interested in getting another one after mine uses up/breaks/whatever. Also it came with a hook to hang your brush!

This may be a premature review but my first impressions are good though not perfect. The brush came very fast, was in perfect condition and was nicely packaged. I had been noticing my legs and ankles were looking really dry. I instantly opened the box and read the directions. It’s pretty straightforward to use. The one thing they mentioned is to brush upward toward your heart which was new to me but I did it. The brush was easy to hold, the strap works pretty well. I have small hands so the strap might be too tight for someone with large hands. The bristles are nice - not so hard that it’s painful, not so soft that it feels useless. I could instantly see dry skin coming off (which was both amazing and gross - next time I will do it in the tub instead of just standing in my bathroom). The one thing that bothered me is immediately saw bristles coming out - not enough to be completely horrified but it seemed strange that they would fall out so quickly and easily. So far, so good but if the bristle fallout becomes an issue, I will update my review.

This was mentioned for use in dry brushing on the body. For myself, I wouldn’t do it because my skin is rather sensitive. If your skin isn’t sensitive, then the brush would probably do a decent job.I use this in the tubby 🛀. The bristles are much softer and more gentle when they make contact with the water. Even though this is the case, I notice the brush gets off a lot of dead skin with little effort. And mine is at times difficult and stubborn to remove. My skin feels much better and cleaner after I use it.I like the size and shape of the brush. My hands are small, so this is perfect for me.

Wish the bristles were a bit firmer

I didn’t particularly like the strap on the brush

After one use I see a difference

I have thick hair and sensitive skin, so shaving is always tricky for me. I get ingrowns often between shaving, but starting to use this brush weekly has REALLY helped. I don't mind rougher things against my skin, but the bristles were a good texture - not TOO hard and not TOO soft. The bristles also didn't all immediately fall off, even after washing it a few times.My hands often get sore but even when not using the strap, the shape/size of the brush is very easy to hold. I wish the strap was a little more secure - but I'm also realistic knowing that anything you use a lot + clean will stretch out. The brush itself is very sturdy though, so if you use it a lot to the point the strap stretches you could easily add your own.Great product! Highly recommend

Nice shape and quality. Overall the brush was a bit small.

Feels great to use — both on my skin and how it feels to hold, it’s not awkward or anything like that. My one complaint is that the bristles seem to bend (kind of snapping in half) and the few times I’ve used it about a dozen of the bristles are found at the bottom of my tub each time :(

I've only used it 2 times due to receiving it a few days ago.  So far I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Very easy to handle.

The bristles aren’t too hard or soft and easily get the job done. The size is a little on the smaller side, however it helps create more smooth and even strokes. First time dry brushing so don’t have anything to compare it to. Came with a nice hook so it’s easy to hang up in the bathroom or under the cabinets. Great product for the price

This brush is a great size and fits in my hand perfectly. The strap ensures that it stays on my hand while I'm brushing. The bristles are a tad hard, but they make for excellent exfoliation. The first time I used the brush I could see the dead skin being brushed away and immediately noticed a change in the softness of my skin. Some of the bristles fell away the first time I used the brush, but I read that this happens often with the brush in reviews that I read before I purchased the brush, so I was not surprised. I bought the brush to tighten my skin and hopefully reduce the appearence of cellulite. Thus far, it is too soon to tell if it will work for cellultie, but my skin is drastically softer, so I will continue to use the brush whether my cellulite diminishes or not. I wish I would have bought this product sooner.

Little bit of shedding initially but they did mention that it was going to in the beginning and stop after a while. Strap is slightly too big I would have preferred an elastic band. Overall, good for beginners just getting into dry brushing.Edit: Came back and changed my 4 stars to a 5 star review after a month of use! I think this brush is great for people just getting into dry brushing. I cant say that it helps a lot with cellulite as thats not why I bought it. It does help with ingrown hairs for before epilating, I have noticed a significant decrease of ingrowns. It also leaves my skin super soft. The bristles have softened over time, however I prefer it slightly softer as it is not as abrasive and can then be used everyday.

I learned about dry brushing and have used this for that purpose and it actually works sooo well. I mainly use it for exfoliation as it literally helps with getting dead skin off too. I do this before showering but also after shower mostly when I’ve dried myself up. The bristles are not too hard that it’ll hurt your skin but it is still coarse enough to do its job. The brush fits perfectly on my hand. They also give you a little holder but I don’t use it (a little flimsy feeling).Overall, it works very well and I love the feeling of the bristles. I love the design too and I like that the handle material is sturdy

Great for skin. Not too rough but definitely gets the job done. Love the design too!

I use this most morning & have a simple self care routine of dry brushing my body when I first get up in the morning. It makes you feel great! Invigorated, and I know this is super supportive of the lymphatic system. I'm a naturopath & often recommend the practice to those seeking to support the lymphatic system for various reasons. Makes you skin feel great too - smoother & glowier (if that's not a word, it should be)!!

I didn't realize that my legs would feel this good. Highly recommend. Bristles are soft but seem to wake-up my legs

Comes with a handle which is easy to use, and a sticky to the wall to attach it when in shower. since it’s a dry brush, unsure if i should clean everyday but 10/10 recommend for circulation!

Nice body brush for a fair price

I love how it foliates the skin. The bristles are soft but firm

nice texture….soft and flexible

It is really amazing, I got this to do dry brush massage, and the effect after first use was amazing

If I used it more I would be able to for sure say it’s the best but couple times I have I love it

A great brush.

It is a good quality and it isn't TOO soft, which I was worried it would be. When you are a long time dry brusher, you don't want a soft bristle. It needs to be stiff but not too much!!

Good dry brush. Used only x2 so far.

VERY STURDY GREAT FOOT BRUSH

Great for exfoliating before and after shower!

I just received this brush last week.  It was recommended to me.  I was hesitant at first, as I had owned a dry brush in the past,  however, it had a long handle. This brush fits nicely over the hand and an be used quickly, all over the body.

Removal of dry skin.

It is a good quality brush, leaves the skin soft and promotes circulation

I have KP and pretty bumpy skin on my legs on a day to day basis. I have tried exfoliating gloves, serums, lotions, etc. I was skeptical about dry brushing but decided to give it a chance and I am SO glad I did. I started using this everyday before I shower and used short stroked upward on each of my legs. After doing this for 1-2 weeks, I noticed my skin to be so much smoother to the touch and I think it helped with my bumps too. Staying consistent with this is key but it truly does make a huge difference. If you have rough/bumpy skin or have KP I would definitely reccommend dry brushing.

High quality brush.  Better than other brands I have previously purchased.

I use these to keep my skin smooth. My last one wore out so I decided to try this one and it’s the perfect size. I’m sure it will last a few years. I love the wall hook included.

My last one used to slip out of my hand all the time this one does not I like it for that reason

My wife loves this.

Great durable product that does exactly what it's supposed to do.

I have had other dry brushes this is the best. And well made. I highly recommend it.

The brush doesn’t hurt like other dry brushes I’ve used and I like that it has a handle.

Use this before I shower. Then the body scrub  then lotion.  Skin feels so soft

This dry brush has soft bristles with just enough stiffness to stimulate your skin. The wooden base fits comfortably in my hand while the canvas strap keeps it secure while dry brushing. I use this brush before showering, after hot yoga when exfoliating is a benefit. For the price I am happy with the quality and craftsmanship of this product.

Came fast!  Brushes dead skin off and rejuvenates!!  Happy with this brush!

Great for dry brushing! Easy to use and matches the photo.

It’s a decent size. Th bristles are softer than my previous brush, but I just use more force.

This dry brush is great for lymphatic cleansing. Good quality and sturdy.

The bristles on this brush are amazing, do not hurt and make my skin glow. If you have any imperfections on your skin, this will take it right off!

Perfect combination of firmness and flexibility in the brush!  Much preferred over any other brush I have used.

I use this frequently on my skin to dry brush and it has helped with curing my strawberry legs . The bristles are firm but not hard and scratchy and the handle is ergonomic

This is a good dense bristle brush. It’s great for exfoliating the entire body. Very sturdy and reliable. Great value.

Removes any abnormalities in skin texture when used CONSISTENTLY. I do it every time before showering and i’m smooth as butter.

The first ime I use it it's a little rough. I took my time bu doing it once a day.. so far I can see changes on my skin

I have lymphedema and dry brush several times a week. This brush is soft but gives gentle movement when you dry brush. It was recommended by my PT. Has a nice comfortable handle to help hold onto the brush.  Cute in appearance so you can leave it out on tub or vanity etc.  Can be cleaned in soapy water if necessary.

I really like this body brush. The bristles are gentle on my skin. Excellent quality. I totally recommend it.

Use this for dry brushing , works great but not too hard too soft , also comes with a hook.

This was my first dry brush and I truly did not know what to expect! The first couple times it wasn't uncomfortable but it wasn't comfortable, if you know what I mean. Once you get more comfortable doing it and finding the right pressure, I feel like it becomes easier and less painful. I saw great results almost immediately upon dry brushing!

Great for skin massage and dry brushing before shower Excellent and long lasting

The bristles are the perfect between soft and hard. I can't believe what a difference it's made in releasing toxins in my body! I use this every time before showering. The handle is a little bit loose but I have small hands. But I can still make it work just fine. It's made my skin so much more smooth! Great value for the money!

I like the product

I ordered this to start dry brushing and it's exactly what I needed! The bristles are a good level of firm, but not scratchy. The handle fits my hand perfectly. It appears to be durable and well made. Looks exactly as pictured.

I bought this itemmonths back I like to try before I give my honest opinion. This brush is soft. With nice materials the brush has not fallen apart with months of constant use nor has change color. It has improved circulation and my skin has improved  in texture. I advise for you to try it. Is not costly and is great quality. Hope this helps

I purchased to help dry sweep my body which is supposed to help remove toxins with the lymph nodes.  I’ve ended up using them to clean around my toes after gardening to get the dirt from around my toenails.  Glad I purchased!

Works very well …. wash by hand …. air dry.

I wish I could give zero stars. They have doused these in a heavy heavy floral scent. It's suffocating and burns my skin. The rank is hard to wash back off too. It's akin to rubbing dryer sheets all over your face and the shoving one up each nostril. Can not recommend to anyone.

*Manufactured in another country/not US.*Ingredients differ from US product.*Wipes date of manufacture is TWO years ago.*Packaging differs from US product.

These work well to remove mineral spf, but be warned they are highly scented and that scent does not go away. You definitely need to wash your face afterwards. I do not know why companies like this use such harsh and strong fragrances. The product would be good without it.

Ouch!  Immediate burning sensation on my skin!!  Had to wash it off ASAP.  Before buying these, I looked all over for their list of ingredients, but couldn't find it.  When it arrived, I saw that there were  WAY TOO MANY ingredients for someone with sensitive skin. No wonder they made the list of ingredients difficult to find!  I couldn't find it until AFTER my order arrived--and it took of few minutes of searching yet AGAIN to finally FIND the long list of ingreidents.--and the very end of their promotional of the product.  No wonder they're reluctant to disclose all the many ingredients.  This is NOT for sensitive skin.

I found those to be very scratchy/abrasive on the face. They are not soft like ones I have purchased in a store. I would not buy them again from this site.

Everytime I used these on my face, it takes the makeup off fine but when I get to my eye area, my skin starts to literally hurt and feel like it’s burning. I dislike it so much. Will not buy again.

I usually like this brand, however these wipes leave my skin feeling like there is a thick layer of residue on it. It is extremely uncomfortable. It goes away after I wash my face with a cloth and warm water but that pretty much makes these wipes a moot point. I have found another brand since that does not leave this feeling and is hydrating so will not be purchasing again, but will continue using other Neutrogena products because I do like the company overall. This product is just a bust for me.For reference: I have normal to oily skin. I generally have clear skin but do have black heads, cystic acne and white heads on occasion.

This made my sensitive skin feel like it was on fire and the smell was a bit strong.

I think I received a bad batch. I’ve purchased these MANY times and they are always so plush and soft. The pack I got this time feels like they are scratchy dryer sheets that they soaked in soap. They hurt my face and leave my skin red and irritated. Will be returning :(

I ordered these wipes and loved them- the ultra soft towelettes were amazing for my skin, so I ordered them again. The second time I received a different version- one that was not the “ultra soft” and had different packaging. These were harsh on my skin and are not as moisturizing. You are not guaranteed to receive what is pictured in the listing.

This product is not made in America. This product is from Dubai UAE. I am returning because I do not want to use any product on my eyes that is not made in American and doesn’t adhere to American standards. I feel Amazon should advise of the product origins in the description section on the product page so the consumer can make informed decisions.

I’ve purchased these wipes from Amazon for over a year and this time they are different. Very dried out and irritating to my face and the price has gone up. Even the packing is different. I’ll be going to the store instead of purchasing from Amazon again

I purchased these because the regular wipes of this brand (my go to) were sold out.OMG, I HATE THEM! I'm not sure why but these take at least 3 wipes to remove makeup before being able to wash my face. I do not wear caked up makeup but with  lots after cloth you would think I did. These wipes literally rub the makeup all over. You can watch in the mirror as you wipe and wipe it keeps smearing as you wipe, it's so annoying and just wasteful.I don't wear makeup daily so these are supposed to last ...it's two packs. I already need to buy more (regular one now) in under 2 months. I also hate how these are my fingers feel, I quickly try washing off before my fingers touch eachother, so weird.Never again.

It’s listed as a “double” pack, but I only received one.  I placed a second order thinking maybe I misread it or ordered it wrong.  Nope, it came the second time as a single pack!

I’m giving one star because it doesn’t remove mascara, regular much less waterproof and it left the skin around mg eyes very irritated and raw, when I saw that removes waterproof make up, I was excited but it really doesn’t, will not buy again.

These have an unbelievably strong fragrance. If you are sensitive to smells or perfumes, don't get these.

This is my brand that I love. So this time I ordered & it came. Well.... the wipes had a greasy substance that turned my finger white. Also, it has another language on the label, yet I don't understand.

I bought these because I use their lotion, but these wipes burn the crap out of my skin. I do have pale sensitive skin, but it's supposed to be sensitive skin friendly. I normally use their grapefruit wipes and those don't hurt at all. The grapefruit ones use a very soft cloth, but this one feels very textured and rough. I recommend purchasing their grapefruit wipes instead they're much nicer.

The product is great that is why I ordered a box of 2 packs.  Seller sent one pack not - I couldn't email seller, so I had to return it.  Again, I only received one pack.  Going to Walmart to get it.

I love the scented regular version of this. Since unscented was the only option, I tried the hydroboost version & it’ has a gross & perfumed sweet smell. I will use these to clean my cats ears.

Washed my face with one of these before going to bed. The smell was so bad I had to get up from bed and rewash my face with regular soap to get the smell off.

This an amazing product and I love these, the reason I gave on star is only because I usually buy these at my grocery store.  Well they had been out for a week, so I ordered online through Amazon. The price was great and I though how I might just keep ordering this way, but the problem is that these dried out to an extent, not near as hydrating as the ones I have purchased in a store.  I don't know if this is because they have been kept in a warehouse too long or why they would be different but the difference if very apparent and I will not reorder online.

I am not going to use. There is Arabic writing on the packages and its face is not like the pack I have from the drug store.

These are the worst I have ever used. They burn my eyes and make them constantly water. Doesn’t matter I don’t even wipe my eyes- wiping around them like on my cheeks irritates them so bad and I do not have sensitive skin or eyes or any allergies. I think this is just a terrible product.

I have used Neutrogena Makeup Remover sheets for several years.  Gave this new version a try and to be honest, it was a big waste of money.  In my opinion "Hydroboost" means that water was substituted for the cleaning properties that make the original product so good.  Cleansing was minimal and my face felt anything but hydrated.  Won't waste my money on this again.  What I have left is going in the trash.

The scent of this product is overwhelming and it made my skin feel a burning sensation when I used it. Most of my facial care is unscented, so it’s my bad for not realizing this wasn’t unscented.  The burning/stinging feeling was  very uncomfortable and a little unnerving.

I have been a huge fan of these however they have changed. It doesn't make a difference where I purchase something is different. They don't have much moisture definitely no longer hydrating and after using 2 of them my face doesn't feel like it used too?? Whatever there putting in them they must be skimping on?? So disappointed!

I have used Neutrogena products for over 30 years through all stages of life and loved them. But, this product was a complete disappointment.  Feels like it does absolutely nothing - does not really leave my skin soft and doesn't get off makeup well either unless clean skin multiple times with several cloths.  I much prefer the facial wipes by other companies that "bubble" and show they have some cleaning power and do a better job with moisturizing.  Won't be buying this product again but only other Neutrogena products.

I just received these yesterday and tried one out last night. The odor is just simply dreadful and it lingers forever!  They felt quite rough on my skin and am afraid what they are going to do to my sensitive skin if I use long term. Woke up this morning and my skin was so dry that I had pillow creases on my cheeks.  Back these go!

Quantity said it was six packs of 25 wipes per pack. I received one pack of 25 wipes for $16. Seemed too good to be true because it was. The listing in the search results still shows this quantity but displays the correct amount on the order page now. I guess I should be taking screenshots of my orders now? Shipping to Phoenix from Denver took almost a week, which, given the world right now, I can look past. These wipes are great but not worth $16 for so few. Looking into whether I can return them.

I love these wipes... which is why I bought 6 packs (25 wipes per pack), but that wasn't what I received. For the discounted price (47% off), it was supposed to be 6 packs - and that's what the listed item said. However, after receiving only one package in the mail, I went to the listing description page and it conveniently didn't have the 6 next to it. When I searched it again, the listed item STILL said 6 packages. Attaching the screenshot.I really expect better of Amazon and their partners.

These have an overwhelming perfume fragrance to them. They leave my skin feeling coated with residue and not clean. They also make my eyes burn from proximity.

I would stick to the original

I used to like these makeup wipes a lot. They were much softer than most brands. I ordered another 2-pack and only got 1 packet? The product itself looks different. The wipes are now scratchy and smell different than before. Don’t waste your money.

Feels like dryer sheets and does not wipe makeup off. This is not the actual Neutrogena wipes. Buyer beware!

Towelettes were almost dry. They were either old or exposed to too much heat.

don't work well on the skin and also have to much perfume

I have been using the other Neutrogena facial make up removing cloths for a very long time and just love them. I was getting low and was going to buy more when I saw these. They said Hydroboost, and because my skin gets dryer in cold weather I thought I would give them a try. I wish  I would have stuck with the other ones. These are not anymore moisturizing and they feel dryer and I don't like the way they smell. Next time I will purchase the others.

They were pretty dry. Makes it harder to get my makeup off. I was very disappointed because I've never had this issue before. I don't like leaving bad reviews

No disrespect but I ordered these wipes and it is in Arabic so I have no idea if they are the same as the typical ones you get at any store. Did not even open to try.. because Im returning them.

Big Fail Neutrogena. These are a terrible substitute for original Moisturizing wipes.They are dryer than original even. Rough texture, and the smell is horrible.I will be returning these and searching for a substitute product that's NOT NEUTROGENA.So disappointing. Just because Hyaluronic Acid is popular, doesn't mean it needs to be in everything. You certainly don't need to eliminate the best product you have to try out your new product.

Did not feel like the Neutogena products I have used before. Wipes had hardly any lotion on them.

Packaging was in another language and both “seals” in the 2-pack were peeled back/open. Really disappointed, these weren’t cheap.

Wipes were dried out. I think I got a bad batch.

Different packaging with A LOT of foreign language.  Package also torn like it had been opened.  Returning

Face wipes received were dry and unable to be used

Way too much perfum and feels like sandpaper

I have been using the Neutrogena towelettes for years and needed replacement ones. I thought I should try the new ones with Hydro Boost. These are unlike the others in that they are very heavily scented. So much so that I started coughing just after opening the package, let alone after trying to use these on my face and near my eyes. I have never had anything from Neutrogena like this before, and there was no warning on the product page.

I don't recommend these at all! I have really dry skin so I thought I'd try to use them. They are very heavily perfumed! I got a few styes after I started using them. I'm convinced that I got them from the makeup wipes because I haven't changed any of my makeup products recently and I never get styes. I've stopped using the wipes and haven't had a stye since!

I had hoped that these wipes would be similar to their face cream in that it was for dry sensitive skin. But that was not the case, my eczema and psoriasis broke out like crazy all over my face after one use. These dried my skin out so bad and affected my skin so bad that my eyes were swollen and caused pain. If you have sensitive or dry skin, this is not the product for you.

Hats off to  whoever invented these face cloths. Such a nice experience and a lot less trouble than dealing with a bar of soap and washrag. Takes off any makeup and leaves the skin clean, soft and smooth to start the day or to prepare for bed. Plus you get the hydro boost thats great for the skin as well. I'm sure you'll get hooked as I have whenever you clean your face.

I prefer these much more to using liquid make-up remover and cotton cosmetic pads, especially around the eyes.All in one, these remove make-up, sweat grime, and hydrate.  Perfect for in a hurry.  Perfect after refreshing shower (and before moisturizer). And perfect before bed to wipe the day away.

The **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Cleansing Wipes** are a fantastic product, especially if you’re dealing with oily skin. Here’s a breakdown of how they worked for me and how they helped improve my skin:### **Texture and Formula**The wipes are **soft and gentle**, which I appreciate because they don’t feel abrasive or harsh on the skin. They are infused with **hyaluronic acid**, which is known for its hydrating properties, but unlike many hydrating products that can leave the skin feeling greasy, these wipes manage to balance hydration while controlling oil.Even though my skin tends to get oily throughout the day, the **Hydro Boost formula** helped lock in moisture without causing excess oil production. The wipes remove makeup and cleanse the skin without leaving behind any residue, which is key for maintaining a matte look.### **Oil Control**After using these wipes regularly, I noticed a significant reduction in the oily sheen that typically appears on my skin a few hours after cleansing. They provide a **non-greasy hydration** that seems to help balance my skin’s natural oil levels. My skin feels fresh and clean, without that tight, dried-out sensation that some cleansing products can cause.### **Convenience**The packaging is **portable** and the wipes are easy to use, making them perfect for on-the-go cleansing. I’ve found them especially handy for midday touch-ups to refresh my skin and remove excess oil. They’re also great for removing makeup at the end of the day, leaving my skin clean and soft.### **Fragrance**There is a light, fresh scent to the wipes, but it’s not overwhelming. It’s gentle and pleasant, which is important for those who are sensitive to strong fragrances in skincare products.### **Pros**- **Hydrating without being greasy**: The hyaluronic acid provides moisture, but the wipes don’t contribute to oily buildup.- **Oil control**: These wipes helped regulate my skin’s oil production, leaving my face fresh throughout the day.- **Gentle**: Soft and non-abrasive, making them suitable for everyday use, even on sensitive skin.- **Convenient**: Perfect for travel or quick refreshes during the day.### **Cons**- **May not remove heavy makeup**: While effective at removing makeup, for heavier or waterproof makeup, you might need a more dedicated makeup remover.### **Final Thoughts**The **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Cleansing Wipes** are a great choice if you’re looking to manage oily skin while still keeping your skin hydrated. They leave your skin feeling clean, fresh, and moisturized without adding to the oiliness, making them a game-changer for those with oily or combination skin. If oily skin is something you struggle with, these wipes are definitely worth adding to your skincare routine!

I discovered these wipes a year ago and haven’t stopped buying them since. They make makeup removal so easy, and the fresh scent is a bonus. One wipe is all it takes to clean my entire face, which adds great value to the product. These wipes have become an essential part of my routine.

These are great makeup remover wipes, I have them on a subscription delivery so I always have them on hand. These actually work great on waterproof mascara. They remove about 90% of my makeup, I usually follow up with a face wash. These say you don’t need to wash after, but it leaves my face feeling slightly tacky after, and then pretty dry. I feel it’s good to wash my face and moisturize at night anyway so this doesn’t affect me too much. There is a slight sent but I personally find it pleasant and calming. The wipes are very soft on the skin.

Bought these because I was having eye surgery and couldn't get my face wet for a week.  Thought that it was going to be a real hardship, but I fell in love with these!  My skin was clean, super soft and moisturized to boot...never looked better.  These are keepers!! Just wish they came in a resealable package, but a zip lock bag worked just as well...5 stars!

I like to use a cleansing oil as my first step in my makeup removal and cleansing process, but when traveling, it's much easier to travel with wipes. I'm always apprehensive to try a new makeup remover since my skin is acne-prone and sensitive, but I have been pleasantly surprised by these Neutrogena Hydro Boost wipes. They're great at removing stubborn eye makeup and haven't caused any skin or eye irritation.The price is reasonable, and if ever in a pinch, can be found at most big box stores.

These smell nice, feel good, and clean my face. Really good product that I cannot find locally. Will continue to order and use them.

My skin doctor told me to use Neutrogena products, which I doBut was looking for a firmer wipeThis one is kind of wimpy and I didn't feel like I got a good clean..Wipe curled around finger so won't by  again.

These are better than their slightly less pricey related products. They clean all of my makeup off easily without leaving my skin feeling dry.

I thought it would be good to have the hyaluronic acid in the towelette, but the fragrance is too much for me.  I won't be ordering these again.

I’ve been buying this product and the tissue used to be very very soft and thin. But this last purchase it came different and it hurts my face skin.

I have ordered from here twice. The cleansing clothes seem dryer than it should be and it took a long time to receive the order.

The product shipped had one good package and one dry package. By the time we got to the dry package it was too late to return. The expiration date is next month and the packaging was mostly labeled in a foreign language. Could be why the price

I normally like these wipes, but I the pack I got from this listing has packaging written in arabic and were far drier than normal. Wish I would've just gone and bought some from the store.

I love these hydro boost wipes! They make my skin feel amazing! I did a reorder and it never came. They said it was no longer available from that seller but provided another option to purchase the same product. The pictures were the same.I received my package today and they look off. The original ones were plant based towels but thos package says nothing about that!I hope they make my skin feel the same amazing way.

Not the same product that I am used to.  The expiration date was less than 5 weeks away and was very very dray.

These have a very strong fragrance that lasts for hours. I’m very sensitive to smells so these won’t work for me.

I've  been.using these for years now.I love the convenience and feel of skin afterwards.My last order,  the price went up and the size of product inside smaller,  the outside packaging much smaller,  the quantity of wipes less, and the label deliberately missing comparitive info.Too bad, I didn't think Neutrogena would join the other manufacturer's sneaky tactics.

The packs were open and leaking

Great deal for a 2 PK but not great for sensitive skin.

This product has a really strong scent that activates my scent-related allergies. Very disappointing because it feels good on skin.

Doesn’t really do the job of getting my makeup off…won’t get again!

It gets the makeup off BUT it really irritates my eyes after and lightly burns. Not comfortable at all. I will not buy again.

Have purchased this product for years as I have sensitive skin.  But recently learned these have shrunk in size considerably!  I still use the container they used to come in and found them to be way smaller than the originals.  WOW!  Pay the same (and actually more now) and get less, the new mode of operandi for everything evidently.  Adds new meaning to LESS IS MORE!  Not to mention I have to add a little water for them to work better.  What's up with that?!

The seller was fine in this transaction. The product, on the other hand, was not as great. The packaging is fine, except it's a bit squishy because the towelettes are so wet. Like, drippy, dripping wet. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend these to anyone with dry or sensitive skin. Maybe, really young, oily skin, but otherwise, I don't think these are worth the trouble.

Love the hydro boost line, but these do not last long if you're looking for makeup wipes, and are WAY too expensive. Wipes generally don't remove all makeup anyway, so you usually have to use a makeup remover or facial wash after using a wipe to truly get everything off. Would be perfect if these were cheaper, but given the price, they're not for daily use, especially given how few come in a pack.

Requested a two pack and was only sent one. Waste of money.

I like the Neutrogena line and based on reviews was excited to try this and the Boost serum. Opened them both and never even tried them: the scent is overwhelming. In a bad way. Threw them both out.

I carefully ordered the compostable version. The 2 pack I received does not say compostable. In the interest of the environment, regarding sending it back and redelivery, I will not ask for  exchange.

It has been two months since this product has been available.  It was the best out there.**bought the 'new & improved' kind they're selling now.. it's low quality now and nothing like it used to be. There is little moisture to them now, and they've cut ingredients and now hyaluronic acid is the last/least ingredient. The package photo is of the original wipes, and then their current ingredients.

These face wipes sounded great! But the fragrance is heavy and not for anyone with a sensitive sense of smell. Will never order these again. The original ones are best for removing makeup

I love my regular neutrogena cleansing wipes. I wanted to try these, because I love all of my other hydro boost products, and they burn my face  and leave it red and irritated. Very harsh. I didn’t realize they were scented. The smell is icky, to put it nicely. Sorry, but no go on this one.

This is the first Neutrogena product in this line that I have not been happy with. This company has a great moisturizing gel line of products for the face and body but these were a dissapointment.  The size of the cloth is small and very thin. Had to use several to remove my makeup. If you plan to travel with these the packages are large and heavy.

I personally don't like these because they leave a residue on my skin. I feel like I need to wash my face again after use. Also, they don't get all the make up off. I usually have to go back with something else to remove all the make up and the residue. Maybe I got a bad batch, but not for me.

Very oily/sticky. They break me out. And they’re not very soft. Good for on the go to get eye make up off I suppose but even then my eyes feel like I rubbed them raw no matter how lightly I use them. Something in them irritates my skin. Bummed because I love neutrogena.

Quality is not the same.  Have been using for years but not anymore.  Cloth is either thinner now or less hydrated.  They are almost totally dry out of the package.

I did not read the description well and thought this was the kind if Neutrogena wipe I regularly use.  It is not.  This "HydroBoost" was noticably less hydrating than the "Hydrating" formula.  I was not happy with the product but kept them since it was my mistake.  I will not purchase these again.

I have sensitive skin, everything agitates it. Get the original. These do not hydrate and they are thin and shred/tear while trying to remove foundation.

These are smaller and thinner than the Walmart brand I usually buy.  And more expensive.

I tried the lavender, calming, variety before and decided to try these. They caused my skin to breakout...and I purchased the twin-pack. I’ve never returned anything, but I really need to stop using these. Should’ve stayed with the other type.

Used to clean face when in a hurry.  Tried these because they were supposed to be moisturizing.  They don’t seem very moisturizing, and I don’t like the smell.  Going back to the originals.

They work well I suppose, but I really dislike the scent, and it's very strong. To me, they smell like baby wipes or toilet bowl cleaner. It's soapy and heavy, not a light fresh scent.

This feels like I'm scraping my face when I use it. I've tried a lot of different makeup wipes but this one I won't buy again. It feels really harsh on my face and doesn't feel clean either.

I didn't like the fact that i paid that much for them and one of the packages was unusable,

Found them a little on the dry side

Smells like chemicals leaves your face feeling oily

Dosent work on sensitive skin.it is soft.my face Did break out.

In short, it's not easy to use

A very failed shopping

I have purchased these 5 times according to Amazon. Obviously, I like this product.However, the last time I purchased this product on Amazon, right away I noticed the packaging was different. It was strange that there wasn't any indication that there was new packaging because usually companies let you know. But no big deal I thought, companies change packaging.But then I used them and I could tell the cloth texture was totally different, it wasn't soft and calming to the skin like the other one was that I just used up, it was abrasive and felt like sand paper.I honestly, thought maybe I somehow got a counterfeit product but this appears to be directly from Neutrogena? I went to Walmart in person and bought a double pack of these wipes and they were the nice soft cloths again.I'm not sure if this is helpful at all but if you buy these wipes and they are rough that is not what they are supposed to feel like. And unfortunately, if Neutrogena is phasing out the soft cloth and have a new cheaper cloth coming I would no longer buy these.

I really like the feel of these cloth however the scent is overpowering.

I am very content with and like the feeling of my face feeling plumper and hydrated after cleansing.  These towelettes leave my face feeling greasy, not hydrated.  I may use them on my legs or arms just to use up the pack?  I will not purchase again and do NOT recommend.

They weren’t as soft/delicate as the ones I always buy at the store

I used to love these, I order them with my Amazon subscription so they come monthly but my latest order they aren’t as soft and almost semi dry. Will have to see how my second pack is. Definitely a noticeable difference in the softness feel when you use them, disappointing. Probably will cancel ordering.

I want a wipe to quickly clean and refresh my face, but this applies so much product that I feel worse. I can't think were else to use it.

Too moisturizing for me

I ordered 2 and only received 1.  These are stocking stuffers so I needed both.  Amazon made it right and I was able to purchase from another vendor

Used a sample tube from dermatologist.  Seemed more effective than cloths.

Just used the first one - soft, face feels quite nice! Except... 10 minutes and counting of tasting flowers every time I breathe in or open my mouth. If I missed where the unscented ones are somebody please point me to them - it's unbearable to the point of I might have to toss these. :(

I love the scent of this line, but the scent on these wipes is extremely intense

I like the convenience of these wipes and they do a pretty good job of keeping my face moisturized. My nose would still get a little dry but that’s just my nose for ya. They have a really light smell and take makeup off easily. For being wipes they’re really good but I did notice a difference in my skin after switching from micellar water to these. My skin looked more dull and bumpy and I could tell that wipes are more damaging

I got these for my daughter in hopes that it would help her skin condition. So far i haven’t seen any improvements or difference.

I love everything about these wipes but do you see how these are just shredding apart? If it continues I will return! And then I don't know what I will do for this type of wipe I've been waiting for these cuz they weren't available... I love them and I'm disappointed that this happened. Otherwise they're great.

About me: Late 20's female, recently developed very oily skin, and bouts of adult cystic acne that are luckily gone for now. I've been told to keep my skin moisturized and use a variety of products to calm it down. I gave these a try because I like the Hydroboost gel which seems to have a positive effect on my skin. Unfortunately these wipes left my skin feeling sticky and ended up increasing my oiliness by the end of the day. Probably best for someone with very dry skin to start, just not for me.

Removes makeup okay, didn’t irritate my skin. Not moisturizing. The smell of these was enough to make me never buy them again. Hate the smell.

Love Neutrogena Hydra boost wipes. But these have arabic writing and don’t include the “with hyalaranic acid” notation, so are they the same as the US version?

This product says it removes skin oil. It doesn't.It leaves behind a film of some sort and has irritated my skin.I would not recommend if you have oily skin and live in a humid environment- it won't work as advertised.

The packaging doesn’t keep its sticking power very long so if you’re not careful the opening will come open on its own and the wipes will dry out. I usually get the blue package but decided to try these instead and I probably won’t buy them again. From the first use I noticed they were already very dry and didn’t seem to take off my makeup like the original ones do. I also found that they burn my eyes really bad. I’ll stick to the blue pack it definetly works much better.

My wipes didn’t have enough moisture to work well and worse that the package didn’t seal well so made the cloths even dryer by the end of the package. I bought the regular Neutrogena without hydro boost last time and they were much better. Won’t buy these ones again

I have to add water to the wipes as they’re very dry.

These are ok. I don't like scented face products. When I opened the double package one of the packs tore open. I tried putting them into a ziplock but ultimately I forgot to put them back into the ziplock every time & they dried out. I don't wear makeup, I was just looking for a wipe to freshen up with while I work 12 hour shifts. These left me feeling a little slimey.

I usually use the green Berts Bees wipes but thought I’d switch it up. I love the Hydro Boost moisturizer from Neutrogena so I have these a shot. I don’t think these are as gentle or moisturizing as the Berts Bees wipes. The first time I used these they made my skin really red and itchy. They aren’t as bad now but I will not be buying again

Disappointed with these because I usually love Neutrogena products. The smell is atrocious, way way too strong. Gave me a headache. The wash and the makeup wipes both leave a slimy feeling after use.

Not great for oily skin or at least my oily skin just made it more oily might be ok for some who just use at night. Took several wipes to actually remove make up and I do not wear heavy products but very convenient being a wipe for travel and make up was eventually removed just took 2-3 wipes to go so

Irritating to my face after a month after they changed product on me, wipe was smaller and yes not as soft

I have used the unscented Neutrogena towelettes for years with no issues. The fragrance used on the hydro boost is too strong and stung my face.

Not sure why because I only use Neutrogena wipes, but for some reason this kind isn't as soft as the others are.  The scent is really nice and I will use them up but probably won't buy again.

These wipes don’t leave that squeaky clean feel. My face still feels oily after use. Also, these wipes are SUPER fragrant almost nauseatingly so.

The sheets are a bit small.  It takes two to remove makeup, and I still get makeup off using a toner pad after the cleansing pads.  Otherwise, I like Neutragina products.

Really nothing special.  Does not remove mascara very well.  Other than that it's just ok

They leave a residue on my face that I don’t enjoy so I tend to wash my face afterwards. They smell good though & remove most makeup.

I opened them and the next day I went to get one and it was dry. And I closed the package and they still dried out.

Love, love these hydrating cleansing wipes EXCEPT these dont smell the same or as good as the ones ive purchased in the past. Not sure i will buy them online again.

How do u keep these moist? Some arrived all dried...

Didn’t seem to be moist enough

These make my skin feel oily

wasn't what I expected looking for it to be softer

Hate the smell.

I wish the package would reseal better

I use separate remover for my eyes, and these just didn't take the rest off. I don't wear foundation, and they make my skin tender.

I think these wipes do a fine job removing makeup and mascara, but they smell strong and I really dislike that. I can smell the product on my face for a long time after using the wipe. Yucky! I don't see why a makeup remover product requires fragrance at all. Disappointing, I like most of the hydro boost products and this is the only one I own that is scented.

I LOVE Neutrogena Hydro Boost products...all of them. However, the hydro boost waterproof make-up remover wipes do not remove the waterproof hydro boost mascara. Please get this fixed, it makes no sense!

Be prepared to use twice as many facial wipes when it used to take one

I've been using Neutrogenia products for years, knowing that it is a brand I can trust to be on point. These wipes would sell themselves if it weren't for the price. The towelettes are moist and soft on my skin, while the texture is still tough enough to do the job thoroughly. Each one is wide and large--just one will remove all the make-up and impurities on your skin and leave your face with a palpably soft and hydrating sensation. It's also ophthalmologist and dermatologist tested and is fine to use on sensitive skin, like all Neutrogena products.But, my stars--almost $40 for 25 wipes? I'm trying to separate the price from the product in order to rate them for what they are and what they do. I believe that Amazon doesn't want us to factor in price with the rating, but in this case it was compelling. This is highly overpriced for wipes! As much as I like then, I would rather use the bottled Neutrogena makeup remover. In fact, I found these wipes for $5.99--the exact same one--on other sites. I keep wondering if this is an error, because I've never seen such an outrageous price for makeup removers that won't even last a month of daily use.Until and unless this price goes down, I cannot with integrity support this ludicrous price tag for removing your makeup. Instead, stick with the bottled cleanser until the price goes down to under $10.

I bought these towelettes because they contain Hyaluronic Acid.  I used a different brand that contained collagen.  I started the second packet and the claim of hydro boost  doesn't seem to be true.

The wipes are great.  My skin feels wonderful, refreshed.  My complaint is regarding the fragrance......horrible.  Makes me feel that I am attending a funeral.....would prefer fragrance free product.

I am a huge fan of the neutrogena hydroboost face wash. It is my go to during the winter when my normally combination skin becomes super dry. These wipes are not as good as the face wash. The material is very soft and they do not irritate my skin. The wipes are just the right amount of we and do a good job of getting all of my make up off. What I do not like about them is they are pretty heavily scented, I prefer a face wipe to be either scent free or to at least not smell strongly like perfume. I do not find these to be moisturizing. They make my face feel a little dry and also leave a weird, filmy residue on my skin. These are fine if you're just using them to remove makeup before washing your face or if you're traveling and can't get to a sink.

They work great but they are strongly scented. Not a bad smell but I’m quickly getting sick of them

Great for my dry skin it feels so nice to take off my makeup with this but I wish it was cruelty free

Small size compared  to Kirkland  wipes.bought only because  I ran out. Didn't  have time to run to Costco

Makeup wipes when too tire at end of day

It was so hard to take off waterproof eye makeup in the shower. I can just wipe it all off both eyes with like two of these. Does not irritate the eyes or skin. I have sensitive skin. Does have some type of oil base to it though so i dont like the filminess of the oil afterwards and wipe it off with a towel. The packaging will not stay shut cause of the oil though. I recommend getting one of the cases you can get for these and just refilling it.

I decided to buy these facial wipes on Amazon after purchasing them for the first time at a local store. They were a little drier than I expected, which bummed me out a little bit, but they still work as intended.I think these wipes are very efficient at cleaning off your makeup and dirt off your face. After I use my acne scrub, I finish off with these wipes and my skin feels clean.

I like how my skin feels after using them.

Very good face wipes. They get the job done.

Gets the makeup off just don’t be aggressive wiping. The wipes are slightly textured . If you have sensitive skin might be a little irritating.

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Facial Cleansing Towelettes have been a game-changer for my skincare routine. Prone to dryness, my skin has finally met its match. These wipes not only remove makeup and debris effortlessly but also leave my face feeling deeply hydrated. The convenience of quickly cleaning off my makeup without sacrificing moisture is unparalleled. For anyone with dry skin looking for an effective, hydrating cleansing solution, these wipes are a must-try. They truly deliver on their promise of hydration while cleansing, making them a staple in my daily regimen.

Like these for days without makeup and don't take time to wash face.  Follow with their gel cream and you're skin will feel so good.

These work well. Not my favorite smell, but they clean my face well and get the job done!

This is a great product for quick and easy face wash after work

Was hoping these would be a bit more moisturizing than they turned out to be… to be fair, I have extremely dry skin, and you can only expect so much if you want to get your make up off as well… All in all, it’s probably about the best you could do in a make up remover wipe

Use to take eye makeup off. Works great. Gentle to the eyes

I use the liquid face wash daily.  Wanted to try the wipe while on vacation.  The was a dead bug in between one of my wipes that was dead but kinda freaked me out.

I love these wipes so much, but I need to use at least two to get my makeup off. I wish they put more in each package—and that they were more saturated.

I am an avid user of neutrogena wipes for makeup removal, so when I saw these come out, I just had to buy them.  I don't know that I really notice a difference between these and their regular wipes though, if I'm honest.  But either way, you can't go wrong with these wipes.  On a regular makeup day, only one wipe is needed to take off all of my makeup and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry afterwards.

Makeup remover is the way to go

Packaging is good...easy to remove single sheet at a time.  Large package for travel so may not be THAT convenient. My big issue is the scent. I didn't realize it had a scent. I don't particularly LIKE the scent. Won't be ordering again but will use the ones I just got.  Still looking for the perfect facial wipe with lots of moisturization.

Great value

I love these facial wipes. They get all.of my makeup off, even the eye liner.

nice face wipes for sensitive skin.  Sometimes difficult to get just one out of the package at a time but gets easier as it gets a little empty

The pads worked well and didn’t leave the face dry. They’d be better in a plastic box to retain moisture.

I used to use these wipes as they are the best ones for disposable make-up remover cloths.  However, since then I have found that micellar water and microfiber cloths do a better job.  Especially since the top of the pack of these wipes get dried out from the liquid settling to the bottom.

I used these for a long flight. Very refreshing. I divided the pack into smaller plastic bags, they are very moist (which is good), so quite heavy.

Have to use two to clean

I use this product to clean my face of makeup and I find I have to use 2 to 3 sheets to get my face clean. The sheets are too small.  They do remove eye makeup well.

I've been having patches of dry skin. This wipe is super moisturizing with a light pleasing smell. Have to use more wipes to take off makeup and sunscreen than a normal wipe. Still pretty decent. I'm sticking to using it as a moisturizer and light cleaning.

Arrived on time.  Nice texture.  Feels good on my skin and seems to do a decent job of removing makeup.

I love this face product. Only gripe I ha e it would be nice if they were cut smaller. I feel like  am wasting so much everytime.  Yes I could cut them and only use like 1/2 or 3/4 of a sheet. but who wants to jave to cut sheets.

I have very sensitive skin and these worked great and got my makeup off nicely! Definitely will buy again.

Love these wipes after washing my face feels dry I use these and its soft and feels like your face is wet. But not greasy. They are a perfect size to put in purse to have when traveling or just need a wash during the day.

I like these wipes.

A slight sensation of oily but tolerable

This product is so handy.  It's my fallback when I am too tired to do a proper cleanse.  This particular wipe has become my favorite because my skin is more balanced/moisturized after use, than with other wipes.  Once a wipe is thoroughly cleaning, too, I will give 5 stars.

Normally love neutrogena and love the hydro boost face masks but the scent these towelettes have is too strong. Especially since it stays on you after wiping your face. As a towelette it works as intended.

I like them but the leave a slight oily moisture slick on your hands after using. Prefer the target brand with grapefruit scent.

Towelettes are quite dry

I really like the way these make my skin feel and it has a soft, fresh, clean scent.Very pleased with this product

Takes off everything including super caked on waterproof mascara. But the smell is really strong on these. Way stronger than it needs to be.

They work fine but I can’t stand the smell. It is so strong!

They feel nice on your face. The scent was a little too strong for my taste.

The top 6-8 sheets were too dry. After that they were damper.

A little sticky after drying.  Don't like that at all.

Getting rid of mascara.

They really clean my face and don't dry it out but wish they were a little damper

These do not seem as moist or as soft as the original

I love these. Only ones I’ll use. Good value for money. Easy to use. Good thickness

Cleansing my face, neck and chest

Excellent makeup remover and leaves your face feeling hydrated

Takes makeup off perfectly

Love the consistency

I needed this because I am so lazy I try to put off cleaning my face at night. This product is the perfect size, is well hydrated, and disposable. Love it and will always have them when I travel.

I’m a mom with two small kids so my beauty routine has to be relatively quick. These have helped my skin so much because it’s something I can commit to doing every day because it only takes a few seconds. My face is clean and moisturized and it’s as simple as that. I don’t usually subscribe to products but this is one I know I’ll keep using.

This are really moist and nourishing. Great buy

I love these wipes and use them even when I don't have on makeup. They give a fresh mosit clean that has improved my skin.

I recently found these Hydro boost wipes, and I like them a lot. First they wipe the makeup off very easily. And then your skin feels smooth after. You do need to make sure that you close this properly or they will dry out. They work actually better than the original ones.

Good quality, good smell, cleans the skin well

These are the best wipes to use when you can’t wash your face. I sweat a lot due to my job and using these immediately helped my face and body clear up!

I highly, highly, highly recommend this makeup remover product. It is the absolute best that I have ever used. From matte lipstick, to waterproof mascara and all kinds of makeup with just a few strokes of one of these makeup cloths across your face it will be gone and your skin will look healthy and beautiful. I have only used this product twice and already see a drastic difference in the glow of my skin when I wake up in the morning so beyond taking makeup off it gives your skin a shine and brightness that is noticeable right away. I am extremely surprised at how much I love this product. I normally purchase this same brand but this was my first time getting the Hydro Boost with Hyaluronic Acid. This is a game changer. Where has this been all my life. If you wear makeup or even if you don’t you seriously need to get this product and you will be amazed how different and glowing your face will be. I highly recommend!!!!!

Great for oily skin! Soft wipes! Great for travel and long work days

Good for moisturizing. I like the Make-up Removal wipes  more for taking off my makeup.

These are as great as the reviews say! The most moisturizing wipes! I seriously feel like I have just had a facial when I use these. Very “dewy” feel. Worth it!

THE BEST WIPES TO NOT SPEND A FORTUNE, NEXT TO CLINIQUE...FEELS SMOOTH...NOT DRY LIKE SOME OTHERS.

These are my favorite makeup removing cloths. They do a great job at removing makeup without drying out my skin.

Love this product-leaves my skin nice and moist at bedtime, when it needs it most.

Love this makeup remover. Takes everything off well, even around the eyes.

The  HydraBoost gel moisturizer has been my favorite for years and I've always used their wipes. I was thrilled to see they came out with this in the wipes. I love the scent and my skin always feels great after using.

My skin feels so soft after using these and I like that the scent is not overwhelming

I much rather prefer the hydrating wipes to the regular Neutrogena wipes. These are FAR superior

I've been using Neutrogena facial cleansing towelettes for years and they work best for removing makeup out of all the brands I've tried and for a quick refresher on a busy day.The prices at most stores have jumped up quite a lot.  I saw that pricing was quite a bit less on Amazon.... so I made my purchase here.

This was the first time I tried this product and love the soothing effect on my dry itchy skin!

Great product. Easy to use, cleans well, refreshing

I keep these in my gym bag to use after working out. They clean and hydrate like a dream!

I have used Neutrogena's other cleansing products in the past and these are superior in my opinion. They get your face clean and leave the skin with a dampness that dries quickly leaving a fresh feeling that dries quickly leaving a receptive surface for my night cream.

My new go to facial cleansing wipes, it moisturizes as well as cleans.

great product

LOVE THE WIPES AND WISH I HAD FOUND THESE EARLIER.

Good product and easy to use

My go to for facial cleaning.  I only use products from Neutrogena. I have tried others, but they irritated my skin.  I truly believe in any of their products.

I have been using these Neutrogena Hydro facial wipes for about 6 months now and I absolutely love them! They make my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I use them morning and night. They have become my go to facial (and body) wipes! I have sensitive skin and these wipes are so gentle on my skin and so hydrating that I have gone without using moisturizer many times, especially at night. I love them! ❤️

Easy to travel with. Nice scent.

This cloth not only removes any trace of makeup it also hydrates and leaves your face feeling clean and fresh.

Can’t live without these make up and face cleaners.  They are the softest and wiliest on your face leaving you feeling refreshed

These are wonderful wipes they get all your makeup off and leave you skin glowy and soft.  Could be a bit larger.  Easy to use. Ok value for the $$

Good

I love these wipes. They stand out from all others because they leave my face moisturized with a glow! I use them after I work out and it helps keep my face clean and healthy!

It’s good but seems like this batch is less hydrating. Gets the makeup off but not as hydrating as previously used??

Way too hard and stiff

Turned my hair into a static frizzy mess — think it’s better for people with thin / straight hair. I have wavy 2b hair that runs frizzy, and it’s unusable on this hair type. Looked like a birds nest after I ran the brush through my hair.

I’m sorry but after seeing how many good reviews this brush has I am skeptical that those reviews are real. This is hands down the worst brush I’ve ever used. I’d you like a brush that will rip the hair from your head then this is the brush for you. I’ve never lost this much hair while using a brush before. I can usually rip through my hair as well… stick with a wet brush!

The black ends continue to pop off and the brush separates from the wood. Works great for a month or so and then goes caput!  Would love a replacement brush. This is my second brush and I would like a replacement please or my one back for the two I have purchased .

The bristles fell out constantly and were sprinkled all over my bathroom floor daily. The brush also smelled kind of odd. It didn't smell bad but it didn't smell good either. After a week of using it I decided to clean it. I researched how to clean a boat bristle brush and they all said not to submerge it and to just sort of swoosh the bristles in some shampoo filled water. I did just that for maybe 30 or 40 seconds. Rinsed it without letting the water hit this middle part and then set it down to dry overnight. The next morning after my shower I grab the brush to brush my hair and I noticed a horrific mildew smell. I know that I didn't get water into the base of the brush and only let it touch the bristles. But I don't know maybe I did do something wrong. I was so grossed out that I threw the brush away and rewashed my hair.

Couldn't get past the hair on the brush.

This product has been used. I can still see the dandruff on the brush.

I don't agree with the description.  I have thin hair and it wouldn't brush my hair.  I returned it.

While I would love to give this brush a better rating, I'm afraid I can't.  It has a horrible smell that will not go away, no matter how many times it's cleaned.  I would love to return it, but I imagine that since I have used it already, I cannot do so.  So, I likely will just toss it out, which is unfortunate.

I was very excited and optimistic about ordering this brush. I have tried it numerous times with my hair wet and dry, but the results both ended with making more knots and tangles. My wet brush did a better job and I’m very disappointed.

I seriously have no idea how this brush has so many good reviews. This is the worst brush I’ve ever used! It creates more knots rather than get rid of them. I have thick, hip length hair.

Wanted to LOVE this brush BUT it just snags with every brush of my hair! The packaging was so cute though!

I was looking forward to this brush as it had so many good reviews. It came in a cute package with other extra things which is awesome. Brush is very easy to use and it doesn’t hurt much, however after I used it first and cleaned little things came out! I was surprised. My previous similar brush lasted me years before those things were coming out. Unfortunately I will be asking for refund and returning. It’s not durable.

There is a hair in the sealed plastic for the comb. It makes me question about their manufacturing/packaging process as well as whether or not the brush, which is unsealed, is used. Unacceptable.

Did not like the brush at all

Horrible horrible smell that won’t go away! I tried airing the brush out several days to see if it would help, but it did not at all! I then washed it three different times, and after a few weeks it was not any better and would make me sick smelling it. I had to throw it away. My whole bathroom smelled like it! I’ve never had something stay smelling so horribly like chemicals ever and not get better. What a waste of money!

I can't believe this hairbrush even made it's way to the public! It's a TERRIBLE product! It smells like  petroleum oil, I couldn't believe it! And unfortunately, before I realized this, I used it. My hair smelled just like the brush did even after washing it twice that day and twice the next day! Not only did my hair smell bad, it also looked and felt dirty and greasy. Do not buy this product!

If you advertise a boar bristle brush, your product should be a boar bristle brush.Metal bristles with plastic on the end is false advertisement.Returned this brush and bought a legit boar bristle brush.

Very unnecessarily large/bulky, rigid tines with no give or cushion

The comb BROKE after 1 use! UGH

Not great! And really creepy. Seems like someone brushed their hair with the comb and then sent it to me. The brush seems hair-free.

I was disappointed and grossed out because I received a products that’s been used, and you can see hair it in.

The clear coat on the brush started peeling 2 months after purchase. The clear coat can be seen crumbling in the pictures and invariably gets into my hair. It is a shame since the bristles have held up but the brush is now unusable.

Brush arrived with hair in it and flakes. Check before using 🤮

Very disappointed, the brush quality is lower than expected, it hurts and takes a lot of my hair (as opposed to the other brush I use, Tangle Teezer) and it also makes my hair frizzier

I decided to try this brush after my Wet brush feel off the counter and broke. The wood is great in comparison to plastic however it’s not a de tangle brush as it claims. I wanted to love this but unfortunately I’m going back to the wet brush.

Brush is fine but they put a marketing sticker on it and leftover glue made a mess. Can’t get it off.

the bristles are similar to the bristles on my dog's hair brush.  they're rough and hard on the scalp.

This brush could not get through my thick curly hairit has stiff hard long bristles that might work if the boar hair bristles weren't so short.

After just 3 months the fine bristles are falling out. Looked like a really good brush when I first got it but not so good now.

Just makes it look like I’ve rubbed a balloon all over my head. So much static. Does me no favors and collects lots of dust?

It arrived dusty (gross) and the dust never ends. I wish I had just returned it instead of trying to make it work.

Bristle s fall out a mess to clean up. Big and heavy to hold, too flat, just garbage.

This thing does not do a good job getting knots out of my hair and just leaves me with a static mess

Less than two weeks old and the wood has already cracked and it really sucks because my other half loved this brush.

Fell from my bathroom sink and wood split in two pieces.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Fell apart within a week of purchase , seems vulnerable to water .

The brush cracked within weeks

The quality of the brush is poor and it has a terrible smell

I was looking forward to having my natural hair oils distributed to make my hair more shiny.  Instead, the brush made my hair look greasy and dirty - even when just washed.  The SMELL of this brush is HORRIBLE and it transfers to your hair. Washing the brush as directed with shampoo-water (while not submerging it) does NOT help in the slightest - in fact, it may make it worse (if that could be possible).This brush should not be sold to anyone.

Not a quality brush

I was sent a USED HAIRBRUSH 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 the comb and picking part came sealed though but still used hygiene stuff 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

This brush is just an average brush nothing more nothing less ... wouldn’t buy again sadly :(

It’s an ok brush, Nothing special, just a regular brush.

Awful smelling brush smells like if they were used on animals

All plastic.  I am returning it

Didn't realize until I got it that the brush has hundreds of tiny bristles. Hair gets easily collected and is hard to remove. No doubt a breeding ground for fungus. The comb is just basic plastic; would have liked to see a wooden handle on that. Buy a cheap hairbrush at Walmart for five bucks instead.

I couldn’t keep it clean no matter what I did. Very frustrating.

This brush with the smaller bristles  holds a lot of hair and probably other stuff you don't want, making your hair greasy faster.

Within a week of using this brush, 3 bristles fell out while doing normal brushing (no tangles or difficulty running brush through my hair). In all the years I’ve been buying brushes, I’ve never experienced one falling apart so quickly. Over the last month, it has lost more bristles. I like how smooth/soft it makes my hair feel, so I figure I’ll just keep using it until all the bristles fall out. Then I’ll buy a different brand.

Seller continues to put a sticker on the back of the paddle which does not come off cleanly. The sticker is to get you to go directly to them with issues, but they don't respond so it's a pointless thing to stick on the brush at all. That side, the boar bristles seem to short compared to the normal brush bristles. Also, the cushioning beneath the bristles is very stiff.

This is a great hairbrush.  However, after a few days of using it, the outer coating/paint started to peel off completely!  So now I can't hold the brush without getting these paint flakes all over my hand.  Sort of like after a sunburn and your skin starts peeling.  That is what has happened to this brush.  And the wood looks damaged too.

This brush rips my hair out like no other.

I have let this brush air out for three weeks hoping the gross chemical smell would be temporary, but ugh no.  I am returning today.  Do not order and bring whatever chemicals are causing the stench into your home!

The brush part is nice but the handle is not ergonomic at all it digs into my hands and it hurts after just a few strokes. It feels awkward to hold.

The brush seems well made and quality is just fine. I’m giving it lower stars just because I don’t really like the feel of the brush on my head. The bristles are much harder than I expected them to be. After using this brush a few times, I gave it to my wife and got a different one.

They bristles pull your hair our and it hurts to brush your hair with this. I threw mine away after 2 uses wish I wouldn't have bought I

The co.b I good for ccinbung  out curls the teeth an rat tail are great features

I really wanted to like this brush. Unfortunately, after rinsing it to clean it off, I noticed the bristles were shedding. When rinsing I only put the brush, bristle down into water and shampoo and made sure not to be rough with it. Then to dry I just laid it onto a towel but noticed a whole bunch of bristles were coming off the brush. I don't know if this is normal, just kinda upset that I just got it and it's already shedding.

Was super excited to break in a new brush and unfortunately, it was a total let down. The packaging is beautiful and I love that it came with combs, but one use and the bristles and plastic both just burnt so badly that this isn't even worth trying to salvage as the center won't even function well enough to just brush hair either even without heat treatment.

Retains a lot of hair in the brush

It stinks…literally! I shaved off my hair so all I can say is it’s sturdy.

It is not 100% bore bristles and has plastic bristles in it. I did not want any plastic....and bore bristles were falling out.  It brushed my hair nicely but plastic is too hard on my fine hair.

I thought this would be a great brush after seeing so many positive reviews, but there is nothing special about this brush. It makes my hair static-y and the “boar hair” black bristles fall out... do not recommend.

Not as high quality as I thought it would be for the price and description. I would save your money on this brush and buy one or two from the WET brand as those brushes are better than this one and less expensive.

The brush is very large with few bristles.  Not good for travel and if there were a bristle count for boar brushes I cant' believe it would meet it.

The black bristles easily fall out when brushing your hair. I just used this brush for the first time today and the bristles are easily pulled out when I clean my hair from the brush. I will be returning this brush.

Large brush that looks very well made. Enjoyed the free gifts like the comb and travel brush. Included travel bag is a nice touch too. Unfortunately, the bristles fall out with every use no matter how light. Wouldn’t waste my money on this.

I’ve only been using my brush for a few days. The finish of the brush is already coming off and into my hair. What is happening? Willing to discuss with customer service.

This isn't boar hair, it's all plastic bristles.  It's not even real wood, it's plastic.  The bristles feel hard against my scalp...  This brush is overpriced plastic.

The brush is okay, but doesn't really hit my scalp the right way. It feels like it's only brushing the surface layer and leaving my scalp with oil buildup.

Wrist hurts whilst holding the brush.

Pros: good looking brush, smooth on scalp.Cons: Received it with a crack in it. Afraid it will continue to split.

Bristles don’t last very long. Worked ok for a month then it’s pretty much trash.

The bristles got caught in my curly hair

I've used this brush for about a year until it started to collect dust and all the hair build up. Now, it sits in drawer somewhere. It was a great brush because of the fine and small bristles but it also picks up all the build up from your hair and dust and anything it catches on and makes the brush unusable after some time. I tried washing it and soaking it and using a toothbrush to pull all fine hairs and dust away, but to no avail. I do not recommend this brush after having used it. There isn't a great way to clean it after use.

This brush looks great and feels great until you start losing bristles. I was brushing my granddaughters hair and lost like 10 bristles. She has very thin curly hair so I don't understand why the bristles fell out.

Edit: I lowered the stars to 2 because when we got this brush there was a little card inside that asked us to register our information and we would get another free item of our choice, I chose another brush so we would have a backup. It never came, never even received an email back from at this place. Don't offer something if you don't have plans shipping it to me!Bought this for my daughter and she loves how soft it makes her hair! She has think straight hair and gets static often but this helps keep the static at bay

Carries a lot of static electricity.

Worked for a week. The bristels began to fall out and the brush began smelling. My other brushes had no smell to them. I tried washing the brush but the smell only got worse. I tried cleaning the brush with a brush cleaner but that failed as well.

Okay but too expensive

I bought this for my husband when his hair was longer. It is just okay. I don’t find it any different than a brush from a drugstore. I actually find it harder to clean than usual.

Both comb and brush are too big and not what I thought I was getting

The brush itself is nice. But maybe because I have fine hair it pulls a lot of hair out? Idk not my fav brush.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I ordered this brush last night, received overnight shipping which was great because I needed it next day. Don’t get me wrong, it worked great! Blow dry on curly hair was straight BUT after one use the nylon bristles are bent up from the heat of the blow dryer. I’m very disappointed, for this brush to be $20 I’d expect it to at least hold up after a few uses.

Really like the feel of this brush also makes my hair much smoother only complaint would be it makes my hair very static prone at times.

Its a good set, but its not the most comfortable brushes that I've used.  A little sharp and pokey on the scalp.  The comb leaves a lot to be desired.

There are plastic bristles in the middle of each boar bristle. It makes it very hard/stiff . Not comfortable for thin hair.

Started losing bristles after a couple months of regular use.

This brush is NOT easy to get through my daughter’s hair, wet or dry including with a detangler. I don’t understand why influencers on IG are raving about it. It’s our least used brush.

I like the look of this brush, but it makes smoothing my hair painful and a lot of work. It seems to tug at tangles rather than working them out. I think if the plastic bristles were a bit longer than the boar bristles, it would be more functional.

Way too big for most everyday needs

The bristles are not long enough to get to my scalp with my thick hair. My hair is less than shoulder length and not curly. I’m keeping the brush but I don’t feel that the description was correct. If I brush very slaw and with more pressure it works better.

I bought this because my husband has the same brush and I absolutely loved his. It really is amazing…however I ordered mine and when it came I opened it and it smells like a bonfire. Like extreme smell and makes my hair smell like it as well. Would love it without the smell but I can’t get passed it

This is a nice brush, but I am used to the rounded brushes. It takes time to get used to the switch. I have very long hair - waist length - and it is straight. The brush has been gentle on the hair and I am able to get the tangles out, even after showering and have wet hair. It seems a little large for me though. If it was a little narrower it would be better.It does seem to be gentler on my hair than the other brushes I've been using. So as I use it more we will see.

I received this today- haven’t use it yet. I opened the package and saw that it is without the bag. I bought it so that I can take it with me while traveling and not mess up the bristles. But, to my surprise- there is no bag in this box. 😡😩

I like my new brush.

Bought this brush to leave in my fitness club locker. I hate plastic bristles so I always try to buy boar bristles. This brush has some boar bristles, but dominate bristles are plastic. I didn’t see that in its Amazon description. I’m sure it will work for after workout showers but I feel like the ad was deceiving

While the brush feels good on scalp and thru the hair, the comb is a joke.  Cheap.  Does not feel good at all.  The brush is not that easy to clean due to the bristles.  Will keep it.  But the value with the comb is a joke.

Though it was a regular hair brush with brissels

I really wish I had just bought a 100% hairbrush. The synthetic plastic pieces make it feel just like any other brush, frizzing my hair and snagging. If you're looking at this, you're obviously feeling the way I was, so go ahead and buy an ALL boarshair bristled brush!

Nice brush, but handle is much too big for a woman.It is hard to hold.Would like a smaller version, for women!

The brush feels great for scalp and hair, yet the bristles fall out, fairly easily.  Always on the lookout for natural brushes because I change mine out, often.  This style is a bit difficult to clean because of the variegated bristle heights, but the price is decent enough to change out, often.  Fix the bristles and it will be a great brush.

I bought this hairbrush because of the great reviews I read.  It is an okay brush, but not fabulous!  I have long thick hair, and this barely goes through my hair to the scalp.  I have to put so much effort into using it that it's not worth it .  If your hair is thin or a medium thickness, you'll probably be happy buying this brush.

The brush is OK. The bristles cut through the hair to the scalp, almost painfully. The bristled have no give though when using. I believe this bruch is meant for someone with a more fuller head of hair so I gave it to my wife. She also commented on the lack of give and the sharpness of the bristles.

I was looking for a natural brush that would help calm down my static hair. This brush is ok but it does have a funny smell to it and the handle is too thin and slippery. It's hard to keep a good grip on it when I am blow drying my hair.

It goes through my hair nicely,  I wish I went with Total brush of boar bristles. But I still have a great brush.

It’s just an average brush nothing out of the extraordinary

I love the brush and use it every day, but I bought this one because I thought there’d be a comb included. I’m not sure if it was mistakenly left out or if it just doesn’t come with it.

Did not receive the comb in the box

I loved the brush for the first couple of weeks until you clean it and the bristles fall out. Not all,but enough to tell me that it will need replacing in a couple of years

Not bad, a bit stiff but will untangle knots.

Makes my hair electrical since I started use it i have this problem

I did not love the brush. However, I did like the comb. I loved the box!

Had to return, too large for my husband to handle easily. A nice looking brushed out.

Comb set my preference. Can carry easily in my pocket. All in all, brush and comb set work.

I like it for my wavy hair for now

The brush itself is great but they slap on a low quality QR code sticker that won't come off.  Will need to spend several minutes to scrape it off.  Shame it would be 5 stars without it.

This brush and handle are very large. It's so big that I can't use it to brush my hair up into a ponytail. Other than that it a great brush. It leaves my hair smooth. I will purchase a smaller version of it.

This was a gift for my gf. Larger than expected, but get's the job done.

This was a gift for my husband. He uses it

For the price of it, I would say it is ok quality. Not too bad but definitely ok.

This is a good solid brush. Wooden handle it feels good and doesn't pull out my hair.

I am very pleased with this brush. The only thing I wish was that the plastic bristles were more like that of a detangling/wet brush as opposed to more stiff paddle brush bristles. However the addition of the boar bristles is very nice to smooth hair and the reason I bought this set. This brush does an excellent job at smoothing but be careful not to pull too hard to detangle because the plastic bristles are not flimsy at all. It is quite heavy which is nice and makes it easy to hold and feels like great quality. I love that it's wood. Also, the combs that come with it are amazing. The wide tooth comb is very sound and not bendy, and the rat tail at the end makes it the perfect parting tool. Also, the foldable brush/comb is awesome. The bristles on the brush end are more like a wet brush because they're pretty thin and flexible, and the comb end is very fine toothed but not flimsy. I can definitely say you will not get a better product for a better price. This set can start and complete your brush collection!

Seems to work well

She loved this brush so much I bought two!  One for her and one for me!!

Tangle free hair brushing even with wet hair 😊 Quality hair brush, nice wood paddle type handle and the comb is a better quality plastic then any other rat tail comb I have ever owned!

I have a lot of hair and it’s fairly thick and wavy, so I wanted to try out a different style of brush. I usually use the wet and wild shower version brush but wanted to try something more suited to my wavy hair. I like the bristle aspect but it’s very hard and hefty. I’m not sure how to explain it but it kinda feels heavy? I’m probably going to give this to a friend who has maybe more dense hair. It is good quality and solid, just not meant for people with non ethnic hair maybe?

This is a great brush for guys with long hair. One thing I cannot explain: The brush came absolutely packed with lint to the point where I have had it for many months now and every time I use it I'm still pulling lint out of it. This picture is the latest time I pulled more lint out. This is not hair! This is lint. I can actually see most of the dark smaller bristles now. Maybe one day I'll get it all out of there! It's hard to understand how it could possibly have come this way unless someone stuffed every nook and cranny of the bristles with lint intentionally. It came filled with an endless fluffy white cloud that I've been digging out forever.

Works. Nice feel. Wish the brush was a bit softer.

Brush is good

I just started growing my hair out and this is my very first brush I am very happy with it. It's very well made

Good sturdy brush, does the job but Much bigger than I expected or wanted.  If purchasing again, I would instead purchase it slimmer sister

It feels really good on my scalp. It doesn't scratch.I don't really know if it promotes hair growth, but it is much nicer than previous brushes I have had.  Where's the money just for the feel of the bristles on my scalp

I am Italian/Irish with very long, thick, black hair. It is naturally wavy and somewhat coarse. When blow drying,  it becomes an unmanageable nightmare; in that it ''frizzes'' BIG TIME. That said, I purchased this brush hoping to correct this issue. Sadly, even with straightening product and blow drying on ''cool'' setting, it did not help the ''frizz.''However, it does add incredible shine and I love the way it feels (the brush) going through my hair. I was skeptical at first in that I was unsure it would fit through my hair; because the bristles are very dense and thick, and my hair is very long/thick, but it glides through with ease and the sheen is beautiful. It feels good running through my hair, too. One thing I would suggest to the seller, is putting some kind of protective wrapper around the bristles, so that your customers are secure in the fact that they are in fact receiving a new, not used, hairbrush. To just toss a brush in a box with no cellophane or thick plastic protector like store-bought brushes, is very sloppy on your end, and offers zero comfort of authenticity. In all, I love the brush and would buy it again.

Good brush but not for long wavy hair as it pulls it out. The bristles  with boar are too dense.

Great products. Brush and comb are good quality! Leaves my hair untangled and soft. Easy to remove hairs from brush!

Second time purchasing this. Brush is of good quality and seems to exfoliate your scalp during brushing. As described by the seller,  it moves oil from your scalp through your hair, so it can make your hair look oily if you brush too much. My only complaint is that they put a cheap, unnecessary sticker on the back of the paddle that was very hard to take off.

Arrived today. I actually like the big brush and long comb it came with. I must admit I didn't expect the brush to be so big, but that's even better I guess. I love the wooden aspect feel to it because it's so smooth and doesn't give that cheap feeling. My only complaint is the bristles of the hair brush is a little shedded and I haven't used it yet. So chances are you may get small bristle pieces in your hair. Other than that, good product!

The first brush I ordered was used - a very long blonde hair was in it. Ugh. But they sent me a replacement before I'd even gotten the first one back to them. I really like this brush. It may not be for 4c hair because on my thick 3c/4a hair the kinda soft bristles still have trouble getting all the way to the scalp, but I like it. I have small hands so it's harder for me to hold, but it still works well. I also love the comb which I didn't know I needed until I started using it every day. Very happy with this purchase.

I have real thick hair but the brush is not reaching the roots of my hair.  I do like the brush but I need something stronger for my hair.

Purchased for my son to use and he loves the set. The comb is a little bit on the hard to hold side because of the skinny handle, it wants to roll in your hand. But other than that, definitely no complaints.

Not sure how to clean this. I use it to shape a big gray beard into something nice. Product like beard butter, and wax build up. Cleaned it in very warm water and shampoo. Sueezed out any water inside, and dried it off with a towel. Laid it on a towel bristles down. An hour later it stunk badly, and still does 2 weeks later. Looks brand new, smells bad.

This brush is VERY firm. The bristles are very stiff and might actually hurt first time users. I always used a wet brush to brush my hair. The bristles on that were very flexible and soft, so this one felt a bit abrasive at first. Sadly, I also noticed a lot of my hair falling out and clinging to the brush. I don't think this is good for ppl with thin or delicate hair, especially not for those dealing with hair fall out. The bristles also don't distribute my root oils to the rest of my hair, like advertised. But, for untangling, it does a fair job.

Good quality for a decent price, wish the bristles were a bit deeper to catch my long, thick hair better. It does make my hair a bit fizzy after use due to the type of fine bristles used.

Good build quality. Only complaint is there was a cheap sticker on the back of the brush that would not come off. Please refrain from putting sticker on product.

Overall love it. Only thing I was disappointed with was when cleaning hair out of the brush it sheds some of the boar bristle each time.

The brush is a little big for my hand so if doing a lot of strokes I can’t use the handle or my hand gets tired, I will hold it behind the brush head, however it goes through my hair without tangling and pulling, comb is great for parting hair.

Does the job and sizeable

everything is pretty good the Combs and brush are just fine though the one comb is a bit sharp on the very end. And carrying bag could only really fit one of the folding . So over all my only two complaints are the carrying bag being a little bit small for the two cones and the bag having stains on it. Not sure what they're from but that's what was on the bag

A well made brush for any hair type.

Just bought 2 more for my other two daughters.  Great product for price.  We have coarse, frizzy hair.  The first brush I bought for my oldest daughter has done a tremendous job for her hair, so much less frizz and much softer.  It will rid you of the dead, loose hair.  So, it will appear your loosing a lot but I believe it’s just clearing it out.  It will taper off after time.

I bought such kind of hair brush for the first time and I was pretty excited. It’s easy to hold for sure and brushes my hair gently. I only have two complaints 1) it gives off a pretty strong smell. I don’t know what kind of chemicals have been used in the process. 2) some of the boar bristles come off every time I brush. I can let go the second concern but please let me know what to do with the smell.

The brush is really nice. Because it's not advertised I'll just go ahead and let all my fellow Black queens know that this brush is also for us and our hair. It feels good on the scalps and really gets the the knots out. My 4c hair was also really smoothe after. I like it. I give it a thumbs up. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because idk how it does with wet hair.

I got this brush mostly for the boar bristles. I didn't realize it had plastic bristles as well AND that the plastic bristles are longer than the boar bristles. It makes it a little hard to brush using the boar bristle part but, as I said in the headline, I should have realized it before purchasing. It is pretty well made and comes with a few accessories. Seems like a good deal, just not exactly what I wanted.

It gets through my hair without ripping and makes it look great!!

A bit big (handle) for my hand and a bit difficult to hold on to if you have "gripping problems" but all in all nice brush

Happy with the product does a good job with long hair.  Quality is good not great put it along side its price point as above expected.

Simple combo brush - good for distributing oil and promoting shiny hair. Loved that this product came with the comb which is also useful for cleaning the paddle brush.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:I returned this brush. Why the rectangular shape? it's awkward and much larger than I'd expected––too large/bulky for styling.UPDATE:Sosoon contacted me re my negative review saying they appreciated my complaint 'awkward shape' and would take it into account when revamping the brush's design... and reminding me that small companies depend on positive reviews in the competitive online pandemic market. I appreciated the personalized info.

I have long, thick, fine hair and this brush does a great job. My only complaint is the flat, wide handle. I would also prefer an oval head but that's just a personal preference I didn't know I had until using this one. The handle is uncomfortable enough that I'm going to find a replacement brush with a more rounded handle.

One of the best hair brush I ever used in my life. Really liked it. Brissles are soft and smoothly allows the hair to traverse between them. From the design perspective if the handle was a bit more round than a rectangular shape would have given more grip.

Very Nice. Brushes and massages hair at the same time.

This brush looks and feels  like it was made with high quality workmanship. The wood handle is smooth in your hand. It makes my long, thick, wavy hair soft and shiny without much pulling or tugging. It does not seems as frizzy as it did with my prior brush.

We really like how I'm not tugging on her hair that much and it leaves her hair shiny and smooth! It's just a little big for my hand

This product helps my hair feel soft and smooth after every use. I recommend it for people with long thick hair. Ir feels durable and good Quality. SO much that i bought two of them and hace one to My daughter.

Large paddle with very soft bristles, solid quality no doubt will last for years.

I have long, relatively straight hair of regular thickness and this brush works great for me!! I highly recommend.

I have really long hair and this brush really helps to untangle my hair right out the shower. It also work works well when my hair is dry. The comb allows me to part my hair easily. It doesn’t hurt when I brush my hair and I really love that.

Used this first from a friend and really liked how the hair was set upon first use. Got the product details and ordered mine. Very happy with this brush.

The brush goes through my hair beautifully and easily untangles it without yanking. The handle is a little short compared to what I am used to using but with time I am sure I will adjust. The travel comb is perfect purse size.

It is a nice brush, it is big though.

I absolutely adore this brush and it truly is a perfect purchase. The quality of the bristles is exceptional and it feels wonderful on my skin. I am so glad that I finally invested in it and wish I had done so earlier in life.Not only does it work wonders for my skin, but it also looks great on my vanity. The sleek design and elegant color make it a beautiful addition to my collection. I find myself reaching for it every day and it never disappoints.Overall, I cannot recommend this brush enough. If you're considering purchasing it, do not hesitate. It is truly worth every penny and has quickly become a staple in my beauty routine.

I bought this brush because I wanted the smoothness you get from bore bristle, but the detangling properties you get from longer plastic bristles. This brush is great! It has a large paddle and goes through the hair quickly and easily for fast brushing in the morning. I do have slightly wavy hair and this will poof out the waves rather impressively if I use it to brush them out when dry. However, if you have light waves and use it while your hair is wet, your hair will dry much straighter.

I very seldom leave reviews, but this came packaged beautifully And is a quality brush that does a great job!

Excellent brush! Leaves hair smooth. Very good quality brush, and comb,too. Goes through your hair without pulling your hair out. I have long hair and have tried a ton of brushes over the years. For the price, this is the best! Leaves my hair looking great!

Really good hair brush for thick hairIt's also a little heavy at least for me when I first got it but got easier to use after a bit of useThe wood handle is very smooth and comfortableCleaning it is a bit rough cause of the how thick it is bit it's manageable

I have 3 times the hair as most people. This boar bristle brush reaches all the way through my voluminous hair and stimulates my scalp fantastically. My hair shines, bounces and looks fantastic. Along with the long tailed comb I never have a tangle. My mom regularly broke brushes trying to comb out my hair. So I had a pixie cut a LOT

Barely any static, super gentle on your scalp and very well made brush.

The bamboo brush is great quality and I like the wide tooth comb as well, although it’s just plastic.

Excellent product!

Even though this was for my son I could tell it is a good quality brush and I'm happy with it. He's happy with it

Nice paddle brush

Good

I have long coarse curly hair. My hairdresser recommended I use a Boar brush to work through my hair from roots to bottom.  This one works really well.  No more dreadlocks.

Great hairbrush that finally put my unwieldy, wavy hair in-line. I only just got it and immediately noticed a difference with my first use. It also has some heft to it, so it's great for getting out tangles. I'll write an update if I notice anything about its durability, but with the wood used for the handle and its bristle density, I doubt there will be any issues anytime soon.

Brush works great!  Much better than the plastic ones.

This brush is easy to you and doesn’t pull on your hair.  I like the size and the shape.  It is easy to blow dry my hair with this brush!

My girlfriend loves this Brush….It makes her hair so soft and pretty ….

Perfect for a quick restyle

Well only get this one if you need a perfect brush. This is very well made and makes my hair look and feel great.

Best brush ever

I love the quality of how the brush fills on my hair. They had another on for double the price but the quality of this product has an amazing price I'm very happy I went with this. This brush dose better than similar ones I've tried from Walmart.

Spreads my hair oils to my ends very nicely so my hair doesn’t feel oily

This brush feels wonderful. It gently removes tangles and helps distribute oil to my ends. Anyone else brush their hair 100 strokes every night as a child? That’s what this brush reminds me of. I have a number of fancy salon brushes that cost nearly $100—this one is a bargain at $10! And at this price, I bought one for my long haired dogs too!

Never thought I would rave about a hair brush.  This one is worth twice the price, just don't tell the manufacturer.

Great brush for thick long hair!

Wife needed a new brush. She loves her choice.  The wide tooth comb was an added bonus.

Good brush. Helps with tangles and works great. We love the comb. The only downfall is that the type of bristles used makes it so you have to clean it out almost daily but not a deal breaker.

This is beautifully packaged and great quality for the price! I love it

Just like the one Pop used.  All the round, flat, strange looking brushes went in the garbage can.  The bristles (for sure) aren't like the ones used last century but they work just as well.  Hard to get excited about a hairbrush but I really like this one.

It is the third time I have bought this product for hair for the following reasons:It is a gentle product to untangle your hair.It can be for any hair curl, straight, long, or short.Excellent quality lasts over time, no matter how much I use it.a perfect giftit is for

As a first time mom, I've tried other hairbrushes and it just made my hair frizzy. Finally I found a hairbrush that will actually help my wavy hair! You have to buy this brush!

It's sturdy and well-made. The bristles are stiff. Gives a nice head massage as you brush. I use the comb for cleaning the hair out of the brush.

I have been growing my hair out since the start of Covid and went from short and closely trimmed to a pretty long and crazy head of hair.  I had always just used the basic hair brush you get at the store with plastic bristles...it worked when my hair was wet or really short but as it grew longer I got frustrated trying to comb my hair so after much research and searching on Amazon I settled on this brush and couldn't be happier.  From the first time I brushed my hair (dry) I couldn't believe I had never owned a good brush like this before in my life.  I actually look forward to brushing my hair now after a shower as weird as that sounds and it's something I would have never expected to say.  The brush has just the right amount of softness to feel great on my scalp but it is also incredibly effective at controlling even the wildest bedhead and it works just as well with dry hair as it does with wet hair.  Not sure how long I will keep my growing my hair but I am 100% certain I have found a new hair brush and I will never go back to the cheap styles I used my entire my life.  This brush comes with a bag which is great for storage and keeps your brush dry and ready to go.  They also included a comb which is perfect for wet hair and also can be used to remove hair from the brush on occasion when it needs it.  I have been using this for about 3 months now and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new hair brush - especially guys dealing with longer hair than usual who probably have never owned a high quality brush (like myself).  Don't research anymore and don't second guess yourself...drop a few bucks on this brush and your head with thank you everyday!!

The larger footprint of the brush allows more total control of what gets moved where.

Very sturdy and will last for years. Glad I bought it.

Can be used on thick or thin hair. Heirloom construction.

The bristles on the brush are very nice for my scalp.  It is made very well.  Has a nice size handle.  The comb works well on my curly hair when wet after a wash.  Both work well for tangles.

I love this brush for my long, straight hair.As a guy, I don't baby my hair with blow-drying, gels, or sprays after. I brush my hair wet, then brush again when it's dry as I need through the day.It's more durable than a plastic handled brush (I've never broken one in the years I've used them), it has the detangling plastic bristles as well as boar's hair bristles. It's also reasonably priced!The only reason I've bought more than one is because I lost one, or have one in multiple places I might need it (work, backpack, bedroom, bathroom...)Seriously, if you are looking for a sturdy, functional brush, check this one out.

I like the 2 "tone" brushes they have to get every part of my hair combed.  The wood feels great and the bonus comb is excellent for long hair.  This is one of the best brushes I have owned and it really feels like a mini scalp massage when I use it.

I bought one for my husband and my teenage grandson tried it and loved it. We did not fight about brushing his hair for the 3 days he was visiting. So I purchased another one and sent it to his house.

I felt like it promotes healthy hair growth. Feels so good to massages my scalp and  felt like it balanced my scalp oil production. Conditioned my hair and added shine! My hair has never been softer and healthier

I've been combing my hair for years!!! This makes my hair look luxurious! I got compliments on how good I looked after using this brush and I will never comb my hair again! Who would have thought that boar hair would make that big of a difference to brush with?Another note is it has been stimulating my scalp. I have been having less hair falling out and I see new growth!

It works; I wish it was a little softer but it's a brush and it works.  Wood is real.

This brush was to replace a boar hair bristle brush that has seen better days, I have a lot of hair but it is fragile and breaks very easily, the size of this brush is perfect and does not pull at your hair, it has a nice firm grip, the bristles don't hurt your head when brushing. Using a brush like this has prevented hair loss and made my hair shine with less frizz, I would recommend to anyone looking to improve the general health of their hair without the need for chemical or oil based products. A great find and it is the only one I will use now.

I decided to grow my hair out years ago. This brush is a perfect mix of the spiky and the softer bristles using the mix to create a very comfortable and efficient feel. Props to this company for making the perfect brush for me. I'm going to buy several so I have one in different places.

I ordered this Comb and Brush set for someone else.  From what I've been told by the person for whom I purchased it, the brush is perfect for her very thick, long hair and the comb is great for styling.

Great brush

Nice brush. Pins help get through my thick hair. the boars hair for shine

Great product has made it a lot easier to fix bed hair since I started using it

Poor qualityOverall not recommended to clean ears as cotton tip breaks and may remains inside the ear do not penetrate inside the ear…

I use 2 of these, for every 1 of the other big brand because they have less cotton and it seems to be much less absorbing than the brand name.  I am happy to see innovation anywhere, but maybe make sure you are outperforming your competition and dont just label it "green"

These are smaller tips, more tightly wound and less absorbent than the tried and true Q-Tip brand. Might be great for arts and crafts and people convinced they saved the planet, but for ear cleaning, they pretty much fail.  You will have to use 2x as many to get the job done.

I bought these because they were Eco-Friendly. I don't like them because they break easily and in my opinion be dangerous.I will stick with the paper ones that bend rather than break.Unfortunately, these are going in the trash

Do not put these in your ears the cotton falls off super easily , it’s happened to about half of the ones I’ve used so far

I opened the new box and didn't like that they were all over the place. I tried one put it in my ear and the very first one the cotton fell off the tip and almost got stuck in my ear.

These started off as totally normal cotton swabs, and I liked that there was no plastic in the item or packaging.  However, I'm about a quarter way through the box and just realized all the bamboo sticks and some of the cotton ends are COVERED in mildew.  Kinda horrified to think I've definitely used some of them in that condition.  I don't think they arrived in this condition, but a bathroom item that can't survive being in the bathroom without getting ruined is useless.

Cotton tip falls off and will stick in your ears. As another user mentioned, only use for crafting and even then, inconsistent fill.

There is hardly any cotton on the ends!  I'll go back to Q-tip which are better, softer with more cotton on the ends.  I use them after a shower to dry my ears and they hurt; it feels like i'm putting sticks in my ear.  Will NOT buy again & won't use.  I was hoping for better becaue of no plastic packaging.  I'll be putting them on my husband's work bench.  Disappointed.

The bamboo is too brittle and fragile. I can't use them.

There is so little cotton on these that you will irritate your ear if using a traditional qtip. What these are good at is cleaning stuff, especially because there's not much cotton on them. I trim the cotton off to use the stick part for a lot of things like painting or applying glue to a tight location.

This product does not do its job. Tips did not absorb anything, and the bamboo stick easily snaps which makes a ridiculously loud noise in your ear. I would advise against this product.

Threw all away with green fungus.  ## Highly NOT recommended ##

Unfortunately these feel like you are putting sticks in your ear, as there is hardly any cotton on the tips. They really hurt and you risk injury since they are basically just...sticks. I am SO upset to have spent $7 on these. Going back to regular Q-tips, they are sooo much better.

They break in your ear !!!!!

Honestly I was trying to be fancy and get something new but these are really not good. My second time using them it almost broke in my ear. The cotton piece was always getting stuck in my ear luckily it was never too far in my ear. Just go buy regular ones.

These things are terrible.  Sturdy, yes, but comfort is a big NO.  It felt like I was sanding my ear canal.

The lesser star reviews are accurate. Not terrible, but definitely not worth it. The swabs are a marketing gimmick with little cotton for swabbing. Just buy paper core swabs instead of plastic core.

I thought because it’s organic it will be better made…..man about every q-tip I picked and used the cotton will get stuck in my ear!!!! The cotton will unravel in ur ear!!! Please be careful buying this item…..regular q-tips from Walmart it is …..never again

The swabs have very little cotton - this makes it non absorbent. Not a good product at all.

The sticks are so brittle they snap into several pieces under the slightest pressure. This makes them useless for almost anything. Do not buy!

Too little cotton is dangerous.  I can’t recommend using them for most things.

I got these cos bamboo is strong and the cardboard cotton buds always bend. But these snap very easily and it’s frustrating

I’ve bought these before and loved them, but I do not love that I received my product like this.. don’t know if I should send it back or suck it up. Contaminated?

Not a lot of cotton on ends and break easily.

Barely any cotton on the ends, risking injury with each use

My product was damaged

The tip broke off inside my ear

I am not sure why but every few months it seems like I get amnesia and purchase an "eco-friendly"/greener alternative to q-tips, only to be constantly annoyed when the inevitably are of inferior quality. these were no exception. 3/4 of the cotton swaps with fall off mid-use, leaving you just jabbing a stick in your ear. I am not sure why it seems only q-tip has been able to master what seems like an obvious requirement of a cotton swab: that the cotton STAYS on the stick during use, but alas, that is the case. Would not recommend you purchase these. Glad they are biodegradable bc they are ending up the garbage.

I, these cotton swabs are very flimsy and break quite easily. I use cotton swabs for a multitude of things and any type of pressure whatsoever. Causes the bamboo to snap in half.

These so-called bamboo cotton swabs are in fact absorbent, but the sticks are quite brittle and snap easily. Be careful if you want to use them for any healthcare tasks.

I bought these for the double tip and they look longer in the picture but when i got them, they’re the exact same size as the regular old qtips. Only difference is that their bamboo

Several of the bamboo sticks have broken within a short period of use.  I like that they are environmentally friendly, but the splintered / sharp sticks pose a hazard.

The bamboo which is what the stick is made of is very thin and very fragile so when you go to use it it snaps and breaks.

The wood sticks are short and hardly , any cotton on either end

These easily snap in two.

The cotton falls apart in your ear. Just buy Q-tip. I am only using them until I use them all up.

Not enough cotton, literally has poked my ear with the stick

The cotton tips have come loose - off the wooden stick several times!

Breaks to easily

The bamboo sticks are sharp and uncomfortable.

Not quite equivalent to q-tip levels of fluff on the tips. Aside from that no problems.I probably wouldn't rebuy -- unless they start a line of 'extra fluffy' tips or something. ;)

Using bamboo cotton swabs is a game changer. They can endure ten times more pressure than cardboard swabs. No more bending and using up swab after swab. This brand in particular is the best bc the cheaper one i tried did not have adequate amount of cotton coverage on the tip. With this brand, you don't feel the stick thru the cotton tip. I've repurchased these at least 5 times already.

Good product to reduce use of plastics (and especially those annoying plastics the size of a cotton swab “stick”.  It’s true the sticks aren’t as sturdy as a plastic swabs, but one you know how much pressure you can/should apply, they’re fine. Besides, you probably shouldn’t be using enough force to break the stick while you’re in your ear canal. Jus’ sayin’.

I use these on my Sphynx cats ears. They are nice and soft, and easy to use! They do just what you need them to do with no problems! I highly recommend!

I get worried about any type of cotton swabs for cleaning ears that some of the cotton will fall off into the ear, but these are very tightly wrapped and hasn't shown no sign of it.

My art students used these to spread soft pastel. They gave them quite a workout.  The sticks didn't break and pads held on.

Eco friendly and multipurpose. Highly recommend

I love the fact that these are made with bamboo, but they splinter and break easily. For very gentle cleaning they're good. If you happen to be the type of person who would occasionally clean into your ear canal (which to be fair is against the warning on the box and something you generally shouldn't do), you absolutely should not use these. See the photo for an example of a broken swab. I can neither confirm nor deny that I had a very uncomfortable experience with a similarly-broken one stuck in my ear canal.

I used these for cleaning things, not just my ears.  They do not bend which is great when trying to clean dirty items that you can only reach with a Q-tip.

love it!

The product itself is good, however the packaging is not so good. Once you open the box it is packed so tightly so when you slide out  the inside box with the qtips exposed, there is no top...a bunch of Qtips fall out of the box....very inconvenient packaging. There should be a top on the inside box with the Qtips but there is none.

These swabs are a little shorter than other cotton swabs which is not a problem to me, but just something I noticed as soon as I opened the package.  What I don't like is that they are not soft.  There is not enough cotton on the tip, so they feel hard and scratchy.  I don't hate them, but I will not buy them again.  I prefer a softer tip with more cotton.

These swabs are pretty rough and not very soft like others I have used. Also the bamboo is very brittle and they snap a lot. You can't apply much pressure before they break if you get weak ones. I will finish the box, but likely will not rebuy this brand.

Was trying to find something eco-friendly and not made in China, not very transparent on the "where" it is from. They snap in your hand and the cotton falls off. Not worth it. Buy another one.

I wanted to like these because they’re recycled or eco friendly but they’re super flimsy. You put them in your ear and they bend instantly unless you hold the entire thing with your hand.They’re too expensive for the amount you get as well!! Won’t be buying again.

I disliked the bamboo stick. Yes it's Eco friendly but it's way too brittle. Swabs weren't Qtips.

I love the concept, but the cotton tip comes off way too easy to be useful.

I love this product but unfortunately, I live in the Caribbean where it’s really humid and I get mold on the stick part of it.

The bamboo part is stiff and break easily when using it. The cotton tip also fell off completely TWICE when I use it when cleaning my ear which is very scary.

I was expecting a larger cotton ball on the ends.

Would be perfect in every way if the cotton Tip wasn’t as flimsy as it is, therefore could feel the stick through the cotton tip when cleaning your ears. Other than for cleaning your ears these are fairly good..

I’m normal usage, about 30% of them just snap

Wish I could say they are as strong as regular q-tips at same price level but unfortunately they are not. They often snap.

Not enough cotton in my opinion very stiff and dry. I wouldn't get it again

These are a little harder and smaller than q-tips, but they get the job done

Overall pretty good, but they do break easily so be careful how you use them.

Cotton is skimpy.

I don’t like because it’s not soft

Like that it is earth friendly however disappointed with poor absorption

Not as fluffy at the cotton ends as I would like.

The cotton ends are very firm and scratchy

They will break from time to time but not always. Other then that they do the job!

These are great except they need just a little more cotton.

I really like the quality,  I will recommend these over any other and buy again

Now never put anything smaller in your ear.  PSA.  I found swabs today getting weaker and less budding.  Trying to swap your outer ear or clean environmental crevices, they just don't hold up.  Whether it is paper stick or plastic all they do is bend and wild variations among the amount of cotton budding.These are good.  I guess they might be friendlier for the environment too.

Great product except that the bamboo is easier to break than one might think.

I’ve always been a J&J q-tips person, my entire life! I decided to try these and they are good. I think I still prefer J&J, they’re stronger and have more cotton

Purchased for craft use, but the sticks aren't as sturdy as I'd like, and seem to crack easily. Better than the cardboard stick swabs, which absorb water and get too soft. Probably won't need to buy them again, but not sure if I would. We'll see if there are more cracking problems. Bamboo splinters are unpleasant. Although these are vegan, I wouldn't include them as part of a well balanced diet. Just had to say it.

The sturdiness of these swabs is nice for things like cleaning the bellybutton.

However watch the bamboo sticks as the tend to break easily.

Box in the picture is open so the box itself appears bigger but overall was satisfied with purchase

I guess it’s cool. It’s nice to use and definitely is harder than regular qtips. So far from my first box, only 2 were broken in half but whatever, there’s 500 after all. If you clean your ears with regular Qtips and after you use it, it’s all warped from pressure, these aren’t for you because they will snap in your ear but it’s not at all hard to come out!

I thought the idea of these were great because of the environmental friendly part of it. I just got a splinter from one and honestly forgot how crappy splinters were.

They are a bit smaller then what I was used to, however they are strong and do not bend easily.  So, size is not a big issue, but stronger is nice.

Don't put too much pressure on them - the stick breaks w/medium+

Works just like a Q-tip. I like the claim of eco friendly.Only problem... the inner box was so tightly wedged into the outer packaging that when I pulled the two apart product "exploded". Swabs went everywhere! I salvaged most.

What can I say, they get the job done and are earth friendly.

These have been great the only issue I had was that sometimes if too much pressure is applied the q tip will snap

Sturdy and does its job. A bit more pricey than other q tips though

These work just as fine as any other cotton swabs. My only complaint is that for some of the swabs, the bamboo has splintered or wasn’t “carved” evenly.

Environmental friendly product that works

like the box

Good to buy

My only complaint is the thickness of the cotton tips.  Really thin so you can easily poke yourself if you aren't careful.

Not as thick as I would like but did get the job done.

Happy with this purchase

Careful. Sometimes the sticks break

These cotton swabs are exactly what I expected. I appreciate that they use bamboo, organic cotton, and fully recyclable packaging, and that their performance matches their environmental commitment. The natural cotton is tightly wound around the sticks, resulting in lint-free tips that are ideal for makeup application and removal. The bamboo sticks are very sturdy, making these cotton swabs ideal for cleaning. They're a lot more durable than the swabs I usually use with paper/cardboard sticks. They perform just as well as, if not better than, traditional plastic cotton swabs. The bamboo portion is very sturdy, and the cotton swab as a whole is well made. I really like these all-natural cotton swabs and highly recommend them!

I like the cotton swabs with wood sticks for crafting and cleaning and they are getting impossible to find.  I prefer them because the cardboard sticks bend too easy, and I think wood is more sustainable than plastic.These come packaged exactly as pictured.  They aren't sealed or plastic wrapped, but that wasn't an issue for me . . . they were clean and unopened.  The cotton is tightly wound and doesn't pull apart when used.They are exactly like a certain name brand but at a better price . . . and actually obtainable!

I am comparing these to the gold - standard brand that starts with a Q. I had no problems at all with them. I primarily use these after I get out of the shower to clean my ears out. That's exactly what I did and, if I'm being honest, couldn't tell much of a difference with my normal. brand. I don't use the plastic stemmed swabs - the normal paper based ones. These are definitely on par with Q-tips. and better than thinner generic brand Q-tips. Overall, I am a fan and like the use of bamboo in products.

These are so much better than regular q tips

Good product, fast service.

Would recommend these to anybody. Always going to buy these from now on

Expectations were met.  No problem with this product.  Not a first time order.

Go ahead - be kind to our planet and buy eco friendly substitutes for all your personal hygiene needs.  These are soft and biodegradable.  Plus the packaging is recyclable.

These are a good quality.  Sturdy, sustainable stick and enough soft cotton on the tips to do the job.

Exactly what I needed, and better for the environment than the ones I can find at my local stores. I will be buying this again!

As expected. I am satisfied with my purchase, soft durableand a good  value.

My husband and I both enjoy these. We will definitely purchase again. Delivery was quick and easy. We have not needed customer service so we can’t comment on it.

I stopped purchasing anything plastic as much as I could.  I like these cotton swabs as they are eco-friendly and good value.  Switch to these from your plastic swabs to help.  I have seen horrible accidents plastic swabs have caused to innocent animals. I do not use plastic straws, plastic bags, plastic trash bags and so forth. I hope we can all eliminate plastic as much as we could.

I like these kind of ear cleaning because they are made of bamboo and having that little piece of mind is great. We have so much plastic in everything already so this is one of my tiny contributions to the world. They are strong and didn't notice any difference between them. I strongly recommend it.

It's nice to have a product that does not contain plastic.  Works well.

This is 3rd time I've ordered these.  Put them on a renewing subscription this time.  The cotton swab itself is as good or better than others on the market.  The bamboo doesn't bend like paper, and performs equivalent to plastic but is more environmentally friendly.  Even the packaging is fairly "green" compared to the plastic that is common.  The Mrs. is equally satisfied.

I like these Q-tips as they don't break and they have enough of the "fluff" to use

Great product softer than other brands.

Q-tips have nothing on these! These have nice thick cotton firmly glued to the shaft, none of that tip fluffing into a wild loose ball stuff that happens with the cheap guys. Nice sturdy wooden shaft.

I am so impressed by the quality of these cotton swabs. They are sturdy & absorbent, so they leave your ears feeling clean and dry. Plus, this is a great value for the money since they will last a long time.

I feel the previous reviewers who’ve snapped the stick whilst using this product, might be going a little too hard. I use soft gentle caressing movements like an ocean tickling the sands of a shore line. Ok to be serious- you shouldn’t be sticking stuff too deep in your ear canal anyways. The last thing you need is to perforate your ear drum. See an ENT (Ear Nose Throat) specialist if your feel you have some waxy rascals deep inside your ears. Or maybe use a wax softener before using an ear bud.Overall great product. Great packaging. Reduce plastics (see Q-tip brand massive clear plastic shell they use. Ugh)I will order again. Mahalo

Not plastics or synthetics so I feel less wasteful with a single-use product.  They go in my compost pile.

I LOVE the case that they come in because it fits in my drawer very nicely and doesn't take up much room. I dont think that these are any more or less absorbent than regular Q-tips, but I like them just fine. They are good for nail painting, but I will say that I really dislike the sound of the stick breaking when you are cleaning your ears (yes I know I shouldn't use these to clean my ears). They are less sturdy than the OG Q-Tips so sometimes the shaft will break, not a big deal but your ear tends to amplify the sound which makes it less than pleasant.

Fairly strong sticks although one in ten or so breaks.

These swabs are very durable. They don't break into when using them and the cotton doesn't come off easily.  They are smaller in size than most that I have bought. I like that about them. I will be ordering more of them and do recommend them to others.

These are not only as good as the original but they help the environment

I like that they don’t break easily. The size is just right. Easy to use and the softness is good too. I will purchase again

It’s a must have once I switched to bamboo swaps I haven’t went back since far more durable and money well spent in my personal opinion

An eco friendly way to clean and dry your ears. 👍🏼

Works great. Stick break if I go to hard so it keeps me from going ham on my ears.

Excellent, just as described

I purchased these after going to the grocery store and buying some that were plastic handle (or whatever that part is between the swabs). The plastic ones are junk in my opinion and the cardboard were more expensive so I decided to look here. Found these and very happy. I believe I set them up on subscription so I don’t ever run out and have to buy the plastic ones again

These cotton swabs are great!  They are thick enough that you don't feel the bamboo stick and the cotton is woven tightly; I have yet to have one unravel while using it.  Very happy to have an alternative to plastic sticks.  I will be buying these again.

I use these mainly for cleaning and lubricating small machinery, and for that purpose, they're a big improvement over the typical Big Brands swabs that have plastic sticks: The bamboo shaft is stiffer and stronger, so you can apply more pressure when scrubbing without the thing folding like the plastic ones are prone to do.  Much better value for the dollar too. Good product for this purpose, and well priced.

Enjoy these qtips and make me feel like I’m being a little nicer to the earth by using these and not the usual ones.  Really can’t tell a difference, which is a good thing.

What can I say the clean my ears just fine Not a bad price

I’ve always been a plastic over paper kind of Q-tip girl, but after switching to this bamboo, I am never going back. I can feel every crevice of my ear with these study bamboo sticks, absorbency it is like a four out of five, but just go back with a tsecond Q-tip and you’ll be fine.

Great value. They do not snap like similar products

I like the way it’s vegan

EXCELLENSUPER FAST DELIVERY on an International Order!

These q-tips are so strong! I had seen some reviews that complained they broke. I’ve had the opposite problem—they’re so tough I had to remind myself not to push so hard with them. I would have to put serious effort into breaking these while using them in my ear. I definitely recommend these, as bamboo is more sustainable than cotton, and these come in a plastic-free box made out of recycled paper.

I like the stiffness of the q-tip when I clean my ears.

I saw these were bamboo and decided why not give these a try?  I am very pleased that I did. They're durable, not thin at the end so less worry about shanking your ear drums. I will purchase again and I would recommend

These are absorbent, economic, and work well for what I use them for. I’ve noticed some break more often compared to the more expensive ones, but it’s a pretty low amount overall.

First time buying anything else besides qtips. These work just as well for me! Held up good, strong & durable!

I like the fact that are made of bamboo if you care of the environment.

I've had this for only 2 weeks, used it about 5 times and look what happened to it! It was bad enough when bristles started falling out but today I go to use it and its almost split in two. The ad copy says this is made from Black Walnut wood. I don't know about you but I've never seen blonde walnut wood. I don't think it exists on this planet. So then, what is this made from plz? All I know is that it's going back, with extreme prejudice!

Comb is nice but brush has plastic rather than the claimed “boars’ hair.”False description.Don’t waste your money!

False advertising, plastic bristles, not even good quality for plastic standards.

Feels cheap and it's already starting to fall apart

This combination is too small for a full beard. I compared it to the comb I bought 2 years ago.

It will stink and no way of cleaning it. I’d return it but used it for a week.

Doesn’t come with the comb in the picture

My husband needed a new beard brush soooo badly, but my ladies know how guys can be..they don't pay no mind to stuff like that lol!! So for Father's day, as an "extra gift" I swapped his old, raggedy one with this one and he absolutely loves it!!It's very good quality, the bristles are sturdy but soft, it's small enough to easily travel with. For the price I didn't really expect much, but I was definitely wrong! It's a VERY good quality for the price. You get a cute gift box that it comes in, the brush and a comb. You can't go wrong with this set.

The brushes in the set are awesome and are  surprisingly high quality given the cost. The comb is great for evenly distributing your favorite beard oil and the board brush is as effective as it is enjoyable. Great product and highly recommended.

This brush brushes like a brush should. In hindsight I would’ve bought a rounded brush but this is good size for travel

My husband has been looking for a brush for a while, and this is a grade option for a decent price. The brush is very sturdy and does an  excellent job at keeping the beard hair in order.The hairs on the brush are quite hard, which is good for a longer beard, but can also be pretty scratchy.Try it for yourself. I can definitely recommend this set for a very reasonable price.

Great size; fits well in hand. It is easy to use and has very good build quality.

"Exceptional quality. It enhanced the comfort of my morning routine."

I’m old, but relatively new to the trend toward wearing a beard, so I’m learning as I go. I looked over several products offered here on Amazon & decided to enter the grooming process with a comparably inexpensive kit, & upgrade if needed. I’m extremely pleased with this kit! I had been using a fingernail scrubbing brush for my beard, but the bristles are pretty rigid, lol. So, why a 5 star rating?The brush: I like the nice, solid feel of wood, - as opposed to plastic- combined with dense, soft bristles. My beard isn’t thick, like the Brawny paper towels guy! In fact, it’s probably a bit thinner than average, but the hair is coarse  with a thicker hair diameter. This brush results in a smooth, soft look to my beard, especially after the application of (as I have recently learned on my beard care learning curve. TY YouTube) ) the application of conditioner, beard balm, & beard serum!The comb: Again, I like the firm feel of the wood! The tines are firm & don’t flex like plastic, & the different sized tines enhance my ability to apply the conditioner, balm, & serum evenly. It also provides a consistent, unified, base for trimming & clipping my beard into something presentable.Bottom line: IMHO, this is a wonderful product at any price. It certainly works well for me!I apologize for my verbosity, but I tried to write the type of review that I find helpful for me.

Use this brush at least twice per day. Works great at a good value.

This beard brush is well made and holds up over time. However, it's bristly and a bit uncomfortable, and it only becomes moreso the more I use it.

Husband likes them, no issues with them at all

Yes it's real boar hair. I tried washing it and it stank for a day. However the wood started chipping when wet. I got a replacement from Amazon. It's a good starter brush for me in the mean time. But do not get wet.

I like product and quality but it came in really bad situation with lots of dust on it. I had to clean it myself before using it.

Beware if you’re going to leave out on bathroom counter. Moisture gets in this bad boy & that cool cherry looking finish is going 2 start flaking off. Even once I noticed & started keeping in a drawer it still kept shedding little bits here & there. Finally gave up & went back to using my old one

I used this for a while, but it feels cheap.

Brush is great, comb not so great!

The brush was the only reason we ordered this product so that's why it receives 3 stars instead of zero.  Nice brush, horribly quality comb.

The comb seems to not have been sanded between the teeth, which in term can damage your beard. The brush is pretty good.

The beard brush had some initial shedding, which I think is normal. The boar bristles are tough and do the job well, even on a wiry beard hair. The walnut wood beard comb is not well-made at all! It still has splinters in-between the comb teeth.

I am happy with this product, it was a good buy

Lost my old brush that I received as a gift and didn’t know what to buy. This brush is perfect for I use it for and couldn’t ask for anything better

My boyfriend did not like the comb in the box but lover the brush

picked this up as a backup and surprisingly, it is reasonably good quality for being made in china. it wont compare to a KENT but its also half the price!

I purchased this item as a "just because gift" for my husband of 38 years. He absolutely loves it. He had recently grown a goatee which he wasn't sure how to upkeep or if he wanted to keep it. I absolutely love the goatee. This comb and brush keeps it neat and clean giving him  a stylish and polished look. He goes nowhere without it. Thank you!

Inlove the bristle and the softness

No dislikes. But for my husband for his beard mustache. Great price. He loves it. Highly recommend.

Feels well in beard.

Nice little beard kit

Great value & great products my husband uses these every single morning. Definitely a great buy!

Perfect to carry everywhere!

Great set for all you peeps with beards. Durable feel to it and feels good on the beard. Wood comb is nice to carry in the pocket incase you need to bring a low profile comb

Husband likes the set and uses it with oil for his beard grooming.

Easy to use. Good quality. Affordable

Excellent quality for the money, works good in brushing in beard oils and other products the wooden comb is almost a necessity with a long beard.

I use it everyday and it is extremely good to use

Great little beard brush and comb, use it daily and love it. What more to say

Nice comb, the brish lost some of its brush hairs but nothing noticeable on the brush just left them attached to my beard the first couple times i used it, the comb is not bad at all, helped with detangling without the pulling

Good sturdy products that are clearly built to do exactly what they advertise.

was as described

I like the texture of the bristles, the sandalwood aroma is great!

Brush is great, and easy on the face

Nice beard set. Everything is well made and seems durable.

I don't write many reviews unless it's a great product or a terrible one. In this case, it's a great product. The bristles are perfect, not to soft nor to firm and the overall size is perfect and the cost is very affordable. I might buy a few more just to have them in car and such. I would have easily paid double. The only thing I don't like is the logo, I would prefer it to have no logo and be solid black walnut.

My vet recommended it to brush my cat with due to dry skin.  It works great.  No more flakes and coat is beautiful again.

I thought this brush was going to be unbearable with the hard bristles but it worked out great!!!

Comes in very handy

I like that it is exactly like the picture. Not full of unnecessary items.

Nice, quality brush. Feels like boars hair like described.

My husband love these products !!

I enjoy the brush its bristles are very gentle and leaves your bread nice and soft.

Bought for my bf and he uses it all the time. I noticed his beard grow

Quality, easy to use & stylish.⭐️ ⭐️⭐️

This is the best comb and brush set I've used. The comb is comfortable to use. 2 sides Mahe it easy it comb out knots.  The boar hair brush is the perfect strength and length to brush out your beard. I love it I won't go away from home without it.

If you have a beard this is a must have, I’ve had others in the past but this one I like the most. I feel like the bristles are stiffer so it really lays down the beard hairs especially the ones that like to go crazy. This brush will lay them down nice. It looks high quality, doesn’t look cheap, feels good in your hands, nice weight to it as well. Definitely a must have!

Brush is sturdy enough for tough beards.

sturdy brushes but why don't hurt or scrape. if you have really sensitive skin perhaps be gentle, but still usable.

Excellent product

My husband decided to grow out his beard since he retired.  He's tried different varieties of beard accessories but I saw this on Facebook and decided to give it a shot.  He now uses it every day now and is very Happy with it.

Thank you, great product

My husband has been using this beard brush since Christmas and has recently told me it’s, hands down, his favorite brush he has ever used for his beard!

small compact and good quality.  I've owned a few of these types of brushes and although this one isn't perfect, it's close.

That most brushes aren’t nice and smooth when you Brush your face beard with them unlike this one which is nice and smooth and brushed my beard perfectly.

I love how nice it brushes through.

Perfect size, perfect function, perfect beard brush!!!

Puffs have always been my number one tissue. Never did I experience a box like this from Puffs or from any other national brand. This stuff was terrible. It was extremely old, dried out and unusable. The tissues had no lotion that could be detected. It was so dry it was breaking apart and even made noise when used or folded because it was so old.  I couldn't even return this awful box of tissue. I will never buy anything from this seller.

Either Amazon is selling Puffs cast-off products that didn’t meet their quality standards or Puffs has dramatically declined in quality, every time you use one of these a snowstorm of large tissue fragments spray into the air and onto your shirt as the tissue disintegrates under even the slightest bit of pressure, the cheap to purchase and free to use single ply tissues you find in your local walk-in clinic are better than this, DO NOT BUY!

I’ve used Kleenex for decades and wanted to test Scotties and Puffs to see if they might be better. Puffs came in last. Yes, their softness was equal - maybe a little better - to Kleenex, but Puffs are dangerous tissues. There is no feeding design. You have to aggressively dig into the box to scrape out a tissue. This means that other people must do the same thing and firmly deposit any germs onto the box and tissues below. You will not be able to access a tissue and avoid this contamination.Kleenex has gotten sloppy in their manufacturing. They had the best feeding design but, in the last several years, this frequently no longer works because their poor quality control is causing tissues to be layered incorrectly. Still, most will feed correctly and this makes them superior to Puffs.Scotties are noticeably closer to sandpaper than either Puffs or Kleenex, but the access and feeding is much better than Puffs. So, for now, I’m back to Kleenex until I can find a superior alternative …and I haven’t stopped looking.

The tissues are deceptively affordable, and there's a good reason for that. And the reason is, every time you use one you're going to be transported to Miami in 1988, outside of a night club, hitting some cheap cocaine. That's how these tissues will make you feel. Because they leave white fiber all over your nose. You'll be rubbing your face immediately after use, trying to get tissue fiber off your face and out of your nostrils. But without the enjoyment of being in a night club in Miami in 1988, just the poor aspects of it. Do yourself a favor and pick another brand.

The tissues are not contained inside the box like Kleenex so it is not sanitary in my opinion.  I bought these for home and office use.  The tissues are open to be exposed to environment and I don’t like that.

I've always favored these tissues for the reach-in box, and that the tissues were soft and sizeable. Now, the tissues have shrunk in size, they're course, and so thin you can see through them! When you pick up a box, just tilt it, and you can feel the tissues slide inside because they're now smaller, but the box size is still the same. Disappointed in Puffs for cheaping out like this. If there were a better tissue with a reach-in box, I wouldn't hesitate to switch.

I’ve used Puffs for many years with pleasing results. I recently purchased a bundle of 8 boxes. I just finished the last box. I’m so disappointed as each box was defective. Many of the tissues fell apart, 2-3 were often folded together, some were crumpled at the bottom of the box. I won’t buy the bundle again.

I love the tissues but I am missing 2 boxes on my order I ordered 4 and only received 2 WHY ???

One end of the manufacturer's shipping container was crushed, damaging 4/8 boxes inside.  Needs better packaging to survive UPS.  Not worth the time to return, but I hope someone reads this who can prevent the problem.

I use three of these Puffs Ultra Soft tissues at a time. If I used only one, my fingers would be wet.They are also tiny. So it isn't possible to use another area of the tissue to dab residual moisture off of my nose.All of the brands, Amazon, Kleenex and Puffs, are too thin and too small. Facial tissue in 2023 is a victim of corporate greed; also known as shrinkflation. Price stays the same but product becomes uselessly small.Shrinkflation - WikipediaShrinkflation is a rise in the general price level of goods per unit of weight or volume, brought about by a reduction in the weight or size of the item sold.

I received them and the boxes were totally smashed

Tell me why these tissues don't fold into one another so the next one pops out? Might not be a big deal for certain containers but it means I have to dig around to find the next tissue after a few uses. Just odd and not helpful at all. Never thought I'd need to ask specifically if this is part of the product.

1 star because I can't go lower. 6 boxes were damaged, 2 boxes were open. This is poor poor quality and you should be ashamed. I, actually, should get a 75% credit for this mess!!

I had this on subscribe and save (my nose runs constantly), but I just cancelled it after trying the tissues from two of the tissue boxes out of the pack and finding the tissues from both to have an intolerable smell. I hadn’t had this problem before and am very disappointed by it. They smell like the box was kept in the house of a smoker.

Don't know how they got these tissues so thin!  I've been buying Kleenex brand for a while now and thought I'd give Puffs another try; big mistake.

THIS HORRIBLE FACIAL TISSUE MADE ME LATE FOR MY APPOINTMENT.  HALF WAY THROUGH MY MAKE-UP REGIMEN, I PATTED MY FACE WITH PUFF TISSUE AND WAS DISMAYED TO SEE A MILLION COTTONY LINTS COVERING MY SKIN.  THEY STUCK FIRM.  I HAD TO WASH MY FACE AND START FROM SCRATCH.YOU CAN'T BLOW YOUR NOSE OR WIPE YOUR EYES WITH THEM.  THEY ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING, NOT EVEN FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE IN THE BATHROOM.AND I BOUGHT A LARGE 8 PACK.  LET ME SCUTTLE BACK TO MY OLD BRAND.

Do absolutely not believe any of these comments and do not buy this product. My face and hands were full of disgusting white residues when I used these tissues to dry them. what is the point of these tissues if they leave more dirt on your face than before using them?! Returned them to the seller immediately.

You’d think a company that charges this much money for tissues and been in business for as long as they have would know how to make a tissue box. Everything is made cheap anymore and companies just cutting corners and blaming it on the economy. Now you have to use two tissues to get the strength of one. How about making a quality product and standing behind it.

These facial tissues are extremely bad because they are very crumbly — when you wipe something with the tissue it falls apart easily and you whole hand is covered in small particles of the tissue, disgusting! Also the package was not delivered by Amazon, it was delivered via UPS (btw, UPS initially said that they delivered the package, but they in fact did not deliver on that day, they just rescheduled the delivery date and delivered few days later)

These tissues are so thin you're practically blowing your nose in your hand.Also, the size of each individual tissue has gotten much smaller as well as the amount that's in each box has shrunk. These used to be the best tissues out there And now they seem to be very poor quality.

the next tissue doesn't pop up out of the box after you grab one - even store brand tissues do this

It's very odd that every box in an 8-pack would be irregular. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to talk about exactly what happened, but I would just stick with the real brand if I were you.

I’ve had generic tissues that were softer. These are not the Puffs I remember. Also many of the tissues had a piece that seemed to be sliced off. I can’t wait to get through the boxes so I can move on to another brand. Big waste of money.

An 8 pack of Puff tissues..the box they were shipped in an half the boxes inside were crushed an some even popped open.. being a soft tissue they were not damaged but getting the tissues out of the boxes is a pain..if I didn’t need them so bad I’d send them back..

These leave a lot of lint, dust or whatever on my clothes.  They are falling apart and leaving a mess.

I like the product but not when it's wet

The box showed up completely smashed. This picture is after I attempted to fix it. Can't send these to school with my daughter!

This last case I ordered is the worst. The edges of the tissues are ragged. The tissues are thin now. The tissues are no longer soft.The quality of these Puffs Uktra Soft  is no better than Kleenex I’ve always avoided. I cannot even imagine what the Puffs Basic is like.  I have been a devoted Puffs person for decades. No more. The quality is abhorrent now. I no longer trust that sneezing into a Puffs Ultra Soft tissue will guarantee snot doesn’t fly. The tissues are thin. The tissues also feel like tree bark. Quite an accomplishment. If manufacturing this product to its former high standards costs you too much, put less tissues in the box. I’d rather get less tissues in the box.

I have been buying this product for many months.  The last 8 pack of boxes I received were only single-ply.  It took 2 sheets to do what one used to do.  What happened?

Ugly boxes. Have to expose all the tissues to get one out.

Blowing nose, drying eyes.

Product ok, but delivery service terrible.  Fed Ex can't seem to discern a plowed driveway and a covered porch as appropriate places to leave a box, but prefers to walk down the neighbors drive and wade thru snow to leave thepkg at a door that is shoveled out or used during winter months.  This after posting a sign (been up for years) to leave all pkgs at the back porch.  NOT HAPPY WITH DELIVERY SERVICE.  Seller is ok and pkg fine.  One star only for delivery.

These are poorly made and many one ply in the box and some have sheets. Lots of dust comes off these . Very cheaply made. I do not recommend.

They started out good and cheap but no longer. The tissues are thinner and feel different than traditional Puffs. I will not be buying anymore.

I have bad allergies and use a lot of Puffs.  This batch that I bought was awful.  I thought I bought the soft Puffs but I didn't get it.  They were very scratchy and the absorbency wasn't there.  You could make holes in them while you were blowing your nose.  I guess this was a bad batch and unfortunately I bought 24 boxes.  So far I have used three or four boxes and it isn't getting any better. I'm hoping the next box of six will be softer.

The media could not be loaded.
                



The damage to the boxes that the tissues were sent in

Comes with free lint shower, quality nowhere near Kleenex.

everything this is like put your money on the trash after that you buy product to make you sick 😫

It's the big rectangle size

These tissues are terrible. When I use them a bunch of little pieces of tissue shred and get everywhere. These just aren't well made. Surprised given the Puffs brand name.

There are round bugs inside the cartons of tissuesIt's like ticksWhen squeezed they pop like they are full of blood

Don't buy, very very poor quality.

I ordered this tissue pack back in March for 39.99, now it's almost $97.00???  WTH?  It appears there's some price gouging going on here.  I don't like the lotion variety, and judging by what's on shelves, neither do many others.  The one star is for Amazon, these soft tissues are good, much better than Kleenex.

There is a lot of powder after use, worst tissue ever used

The tissues are ok, better than others I've used. The negative review is for the seller. I ordered, and paid for, 24 boxes but only got six. Amazon took care of the problem when I contacted them. Won't order from this seller again, needless to say!

The Puffs product was unusable. A waste of money. Know what you are buying.

Not as soft as single box bought at grocery store.  Now I have 8 :(

Box was smashed. The tissue boxes crunched. Not happy!!

The worst tissues ever

Poor quality

For a while I used the 'with lotion' ones but I find I like these more.  They're still soft and sturdy.  Maybe if you have an actual cold or virus the 'with lotion' would be better. For everyday use these are perfect.  Wish the designs on the boxes were cuter but they aren't so gotta live with it I guess!

Wonderfully priced and it's so soft

These are soft and strong!  My family loved them!

Perfect!

I'm really happy with these tissues. They're super soft and gentle on my skin, which is a must for me since I have sensative skin. I also love that they come in big family-sized boxes, which is perfict for our household with multiple people usng them.The only reazon I'm not givng them 5 stars is that I wish they were a bit stronger. Somtimes I need to use two tissues at once becuz they can tear eazy. But overall, they're a grate product and I'd defenetly reccomend them to ennyone lookng for soft and gentle tissues.

Great tissue and great for nose. Very soft

Some items I am a Brand girl. Puffs lives up its name. Buying in bulk saves time and the store and money in your pocket.

Good product.

The quality of puffs is great. Available in the quantity  I need for my 2 kiddos. The design and size of each box is perfect for the classroom. Some are even scented or moisture level, but I started away from those. Quantity and quality with puffs!

I like puffs and this price is better than I can get at the store. The only drawback is sometimes the little part you remove to use the tissues doesn’t come out cleanly which is a bother to this OCD lady.

These are not the quality you expect from Puffs. The tissues (in some boxes) are way smaller than expected and have a mildew smell (horrible for nose blowing). I finally realized that the boxes were probably wet, at one point. Oddly, it's not like that through the whole box, so it's definitely something that someone decided was ok to sell. I've had to toss a box and a half, so far. You can't tell from the outside what you're getting into. Not worth the money to buy reject tissues.

These new Puffs are tissue thin and every other tissue is a half tissue. I’m not impressed!

I bought these for the winter thinking they would be nicer in cold weather. While they are very soft I won't ever buy them again. They leave so much lint on my face and nose that I have to wipe it off with a towel. I don't know if I got a defective batch since there are so many good reviews but I won't be buying them again to find out.

This is the second time that I have purchased these and both times the tissue's seem smaller and/or just not folded correctly.  The times that I get them from Walmart they are just fine.  They still work just fine but the way that they are packaged just leads me to believe that they are rejects.

The construction of these tissues is not great. If I haven't shaved my face for 24 hours the tissues flake off and gather on the stubble under my nose / above the lip. Need something that does not fall apart like these do.

terrible

The outside box that shipped the multiple orders I made was undamaged but the boxes with the individual boxes of Puffs came damaged - hopefully and probably won’t affect the quality of the tissue

I usually purchase Kleenex Ultra Soft but decided to give these a try. They are not that soft or strong compared to the other brand. I will not be repurchasing.

Package of boxes wrapped in manufacturer's packaging,  sent in plastic wrap (no box).  Bottom and top boxes crushed.  Tissue usable but not the boxes on top or bottom.

Typical use

We have been Purchasing these for a while. Unfortunately the quality has changed. We purposely buy the Ultra Soft tissues because the regular Puffs has a rough texture. Now the boxes have a mixture. I am buying the Ultra Soft. The box says Ultra Soft,  however you can see the clear difference. One tissues texture will vary from the next. Another problem we have encountered is an over abundance of Lint in the Boxes.  We’ll open a brand new box a have a whole bunch of tissue dust or lint come out. Not great. Very disappointed

Puffs Ultra Soft simply do not compare to Kleenex's.  The Puffs tissues seem thiner and are definitely smaller in terms of square inches.

Was not happy product was not delivered in a box and some tissues boxes were bent because of it.  I like Puffs kleenex but will not buy from this seller again.

These appear to be rejects from normal production line. Smaller.- Thinner - Not Soft. Cannot Recommend.

every box was damaged. preferaton splilt ends opened and corners smashed on most boxes

A whole box wasted

Was happy to stock up for a great price, and these are the tissues I always buy and prefer, but I have had more shredded tissues in multiple boxes from this pack than I have ever had in any box of any brand before. I don't know if this is an odd fluke or if the price should have been indicative of the manufacturing flaws. ???

At least not compared to Kleenex.

The sheets are so thin with some leaf sections so mangled that I wonder if I am receiving the company-rejected boxes.

I decided to try these, we usually order the Puffs with lotion. I will not be ordering these again They are less durable and fall apart very quickly, and shed. They are soft, just not a good option for a house full of people with allergies. We will be sticking with the Puffs with lotion.

The product is fine, I like it, but the driver left it at a house where no one lives.  I was able to see it on the front porch of the house next door otherwise I would  never have received it.

This tissue felt fine however the rolls are shorter in length and therefore I think it runs out sooner. It was on sale, not my purchase.

Approximating here .... 70% of the tissues are fine. In between there are thin strips -- like 1/2 of a tissue, folded longways. The auto-cutting machine is out of whack or something. The halves aren't thick enough or wide enough to blow your nose. If you're just dabbing your eyes or something, they'd work for that. I wish Puffs would fix this. (We switched from Kleenex because of their wild designs and crazy colored boxes.) I feel like I'm paying full price for 3/4 of of a box of Puffs.

This brand of Ultra Soft Puffs use to be very soft.I haven't bought them since 2022.They now feel like cheaper - rougher tissues.The decline in softness is very obvious, plus they're costlier.I'll take my buying power elsewhere.

These say "Ultra Strong" In fact are paper thin and ya have to use three so you don't blow threw!!! Not as good as they once were. Poor quality. Such a shame. Try a different brand. Puffs has gone POOF!!!!!!!!

Not the product I have a problem with!! Didn’t deliver it to front door, not back door but down the driveway by the garbage container.

I like this product very well. I did not like the delivery. Amazon needs to let their deliverers know that if rain is suspected, they need to put the product in a plastic bag. I was lucky that the wetness didn't seep through enough to ruin the tissues. But Amazon needs to know that this is no way to deliver tissues especially on a rainy day.

4 out of 8 Boxes Bent

These are nice tissues. It really stinks that there is no discount for buying in bulk. Buying 3 - 8 packs is the same as buying a 24 pack.

I purchased this facial tissue for a weekend party, the tissue is fine and works well, however, the box/packaging sucks and is damaged as shown in the photo. I had to remove the box in case my guests saw it.

I've been a loyal customer for many years.  But recently they have become thinner and weaker than they used to be. The Puffs plus lotion still seems to be thick and wonderful as it's always been,  though. I don't know what's going on with the manufacturer, but I wish they'd cut it out.

I usually order the Kleenex brand but since I had a cold and going through a lot more tissues, I thought I would change to Puffs. To my surprise each tissue was quite thin and I needed to use 2  at a time instead of 1. Not strong like they used to be. I will go back to the other brand on my future orders.

I like these tissues, but the items were shipped in a plastic bag and arrived damaged.

These are still good ol' puffs, but every box is mis-filled, so all the tissues appear to have been folded by a blind robot with no coordination.they're still puffs, just...stupidly packaged

I purchased these rather than my usual brand because of a good sale price.  Now I regret buying these in a multipack because I didn't realize that this style wasn't the "pop up" design that I usually buy in the Kleenex brand.  I find this dispensing method annoying, and they don't work with the tissue box cover I recently bought.

It takes 2 tissues to be able to blow your nose without as issue. I will not buy again

Difficult to pull a single from the box …I prefer Kleenex for that reason

I mean, they're soft tissues, pretty much what you'd expect, except for one thing: they're VERY heavily perfumed. I can't imagine why. At first I thought it was just the one box, that maybe it was sitting in the Amazon facility next to some perfume. But I had bought four boxes, and all of them had that same overwhelming smell, and it wasn't from anything that I bought. There's supposedly no lotion, so I don't know what the smell is from. And worse, it's the kind of perfume that makes your nose tickle and makes you feel like you need to sneeze, which is counter-productive for a tissue. In all other respects it works the way a tissue should, but I don't think I'll be ordering tissues from Amazon Fresh in the future.

Very inexpensive, but the plies of the tissue separated  so easily. These are not tge same quality as what you get at a store.

Products are good but gave 3 stars for unsatisfactory delivery. Amazon left my order on the stairs in front of the gate. He could have dropped it off behind the gate to prevent the package theft.

These are soft but likely because they’re really thin.

It’s face tissue so it is what it is but I have to say this is my first time purchasing this brand over the other well known brand and this one just wasn’t as soft or as nice to the touch. 🤧 lesson learned.

The square boxes fit in my tissue holder container.

Ordered wrong ones.

Ordered this for my child for school. It arrived so dented, it looked almost as though it had been opened. I'm sure the tissues weren't damaged.

the actual product is ok, however, the tissue boxes were shipped in a bag so half of them were crushed at arrival. not the best way to ship bags of tissue.

I have been using these for 20 years or more and they are still my favorite tissues. They became hard to get even before the pandemic, so I started ordering from Amazon.Pros:Soft, strongCons:Not nearly as good as they used to be. Not as strong, thinnerContinual "shrinkage" of tissue count per boxDust - this has always been a problem. I guess that's the trade off for soft.

The quality of the tissues has gone down. They are very soft or kind to your nose anymore

Puffs are a great product but care was not taken in delivery.  Boxes bent and smashed.

Too thin and a bit rough

I have been searching for any good facial tissue and I tried so many kinds of facial tissue. This one is just okay. It's not good for wet face.

The tissues are still fine. The packaging has changed. The tissues are jammed and tear to pieces when pulling them out.

The tissues do not pop up for easy dispensing. The box rips easily when opening.

Shipped in a thin cardboard outer box. Individual boxes came squashed. Tissues are useable. Boxes look terrible.

Packed very well

To expensive, they aren't square

These are nice and soft as advetised, but they are not very strong. If use it to wipe something there is a few fluffies that remain.

I didn’t realize it was only one box. Tissue was really soft.

My family and I found these tissues to be nice and soft and did not leave fuzzy stuff all over, so YEA!The only thing I would change would be that the next one would 'pop up' for me to pull out. You have to coordinate grasping the next one as you unfold it.I will search and hopefully find some that are this soft AND pop up and order bunches of Them!

Great economic value for Kleenex

I mainly ordered these Puffs Ultra Soft Non-Lotion facial tissues for one reason: their box.  My husband prefers reach-in boxes like these, which are difficult to come by these days, as most boxes are the pop up type.  These Puffs tissues are soft and don't shred apart when you use them.  In addition, Amazon usually has a decent price on them, especially when they run a deal like this $10 off $30 purchase.  The only thing I found a bit frustrating is that the pull-off portion of each box doesn't always easily tear off along the perforation, leaving some small bits of cardboard along the edge.

Being a zombie isn't easy, but Puffs Ultra Soft Tissues have become my undead BFFs. These tissues are so gentle, they make me question my life choices (or afterlife choices?). When I'm having a decomposing day and my nose is running like a zombie in pursuit of brains, these tissues cradle my rotting snout with the tenderness of a freshly bitten victim. The only thing getting more hugs than me lately is my Puffs tissue box. I used to think my existence was just a never-ending quest for brains, but now I know it's also about finding comfort in the little things – like the touch of Puffs Ultra Soft Tissues against my undead skin. Two decomposing thumbs up

Good deal very soft

Same quality as always, but I wish they would pop up for ease of use.

Love the softness. Does what a tissue should do. After splurging on the good tissues, I will not go back.

Halfway thru the box we keep finding half tissue pieces.  This has happened in every box.

Nice and soft, doesn't fall apart easily.

As always the tissues themselves are great, however the delivery package, for 6 boxes, was a plastic bag that allowed the boxes inside to be damaged and broken. Photo shows empty box in good shape on the right and new damaged box on the left.

I buy these in groups of 8 boxes, family size tissues 124 ct.  I buy these 1 to 2 times per month.I have noticed decline in quality, and probably quantity in the last 3 months.The boxes of tissues are such a mess when I open the box, the top once inch of tissues are all crammed together and going down the back side of box.  Quality is not good.Can they adjust the packaging machinery, so that the tissues stack, as they used to?

Very nice tissues that don't leave your nose red and scratchy, even when used a lot.  Certainly my go-to brand - note that while these are very soft, they aren't the ones with lotion in them.  No scents or anything, just a nice, soft (and strong!) tissue.Great tissues that, if the price is reasonable, I'd recommend getting - the bulk box of them is great to have available as we head into the school/cold/flu season!

I have used Puffs for many years.  It is difficult to get the Family boxes now.  These are the correct ones and came a little crushed but still usable.

Considerable less tissue lint than other brands.This Ultra Soft package  quantity is not the best value.

These look very similar to Puffs Plus with Lotion.  So similar that I accidentally ordered them. Although they are absorbent,  they are not as soft as Puffs Plus Lotion.  I will pay more attention in the future.

This was a great deal for me as with my allergies and a Minnesota winter I go through Kleenex/Puffs fast! Sadly this case is only going to last me about 4 months, but that is a better than buying them where I live. Not sure if it is just because my nose can get sensitive after so much blowing and wiping, but some of the Puffs do not seem to be the "Ultra Soft" it says on the box (some are really great, but a few just seem more like tissue paper)...but again, that could just be because I am using so many so often. But it is a great deal for me!

Works when you have a cold.

Tissues  were great and at a good  price. But individual  boxes  came damaged.

Luvd NO lotion

These are better than...

They work fine however, I purchased the wrong size box and the wife is not happy. We have a lot to go through before I can purchase the correct size.

I would recommend buying this product gets very good

Great for the price but they are a little rough on the nose they say soft but I don't know because they don't feel that way.

Like the softness but feel each year they get more easily shredible, dropping small pieces on my tops. Would like this fixed.

They aren't as "Ultra" as they used to be. In fact I can hardly tell the difference from the regular anymore.  Oh well, now I have 24 boxes.

love the convenience--can find just what I want through Amazon

We like the softness of these tissues but not so convenient to use, especially for kids, since they take a bunch of tissues at once because the tissues don’t pop up one at a time

I don't have a problem with its quality or price. I removed one star because I don't like the packaging because1) it is not easy to draw a single piece;2) when I use wet hands to draw the top piece, the rest may get wet;3) one side of the box is uncovered, and it is easy to catch dust, and I'm allergic to dust...I prefer the regular packaging (by "regular," I mean the tissue packaging in which only one piece is uncovered, and the next piece comes up and replaces the one I pull out).

I thought the box had more tissues than my usual brand but they are just way fluffier making the box taller.Puffs says they are soft and strong. I couldn't feel a difference in softness between Puffs and my usual brand. I put the tissues to the test. I put one tissue of my regular brand and Puffs over the top of two cups. On each I poured 1/4 tsp of water. The Puffs was so absorbant that the water didn't fall through into the cup was completely aborbed by the tissue in a small circle while my regular brand not only permitted water to fall through to the cup but also needed more surface area to absorb the water.  Seems like these will be well worth the higher cost as they do seem to truly work better.On a side note, I wish the designs on the box were prettier.

They are soft and strong like the box says but they irritates my daughters nose to the point of redness.  We prefer the Puffs with lotion and these do no have lotion. The patterns on the boxes are very decorative and go well with any home decor. The tissues themselves are thicker and don't tear easily when wet which is a nice plus.

There is not a lot I can say about these tissues. They are soft and they do the job.

I absolutely recommend using these tissues. Puffs works great on my nose.

The tissue itself is incredibly soft, with the perfect thickness that gives it an almost cloth-like feel. It absorbs and retains water or body fluids quite well. So, the tissue quality and value are top-notch.My only wish is for better packaging. Once it's opened, it doesn't look particularly appealing. I believe it's designed to be placed within a more attractive container, rather than used standalone

I 100% prefer regular tissue boxes with the slit on top to pull out tissues one by one. These puffs boxes are not at all ergonomic. However, the tissues themselves are great and super soft. Price is also good, so I settled.

When I saw the price I thought it was no bargain but because I love Puffs and assumed it was a multipack I ordered it. When it arrived I was stunned to see I’d pad $15 for a single box of tissues! Never again!

We love puffs tissues. In the winter time, we go through a lot of tissues in my hose since we have two young children. These tissues are the only ones that don't turn our noses red and raw after a few days of blowing.  Highly recommend.

Happy with our delivery of Puffs! Have always preferred Puffs to the Kleenex brand for softness.  Amazon is always prompt with their deliveries.

Puff's are the best Lotion Facial Tissue on the market  by far.

Good, strong, soft tissues

Love it!

Very soft texture and doesn't fall apart  after one sneeze.

Soft and abundant. Does the job :)

For a nose in need it's Puffs indeed. I like these better than the lotion as I use them to clean eyeglasses and little spills sometimes. They are soft and strong. I don't know thier rating on the tornado Fujita scale but, I bet they could take an F-2 without tearing. So if you blow threw them, I am impressed. *slow clap 👏

So soft and delicate

Was as expected

Thinkness is great, Wouldn't order any other tissue great valve

CANNOT GO WRONG WITH PUFF TISSUES! BEST BRAND OUT THERE!

very useful

Tried the K brand for awhile, but Puff's are softer and I can get the ones without lotion from here on Amazon...win-win.

I have started using Puffs and like the non-lotion.  I used to get Kleenex, but hate their new box designs.  The puffs have much better boxes that look better.

The tissues are very soft and they come out of the box easily.

The tissues came quickly and was packed nicely. Puff's tissues are soft on the nose & don't shread upon use like some others do.  I will purchase this 8 pk again because it was such a good bargain.

Puffs u!tra soft are just the tissues we expected. The shipping box they came in was sturdy enough that none of the tissue boxes were damaged!

Great deal!

We bought these for my daughter for school. Great product

I love puffs

I love these facial tissues.  It is so easy to get one tissue at a time because the opening is on the top AND side of the box so you can see all the tissues and take as many tissues as you need.  They are thick and soft and very absorbent.  They take care of your needs without wasting even one tissue.

I enjoy the feel of puffs and this set was a great deal!

Great price. Holds up nice very thick easy to pull from box size is good and the boxes are good

Soft nice thickness.Only ones i buy

Soft on nose during allergy flare ups. Boxed nice for delivery. Individual box goes in any decor.

Good value

Best product

Good product at a good bulk price

These are very soft, delivery fast, priced well.

These are soft and work fine. The open box makes it easy to grab several at once which can be a good or a bad thing… every now and then, there is a half tissue hanging out in the box which is annoying. But otherwise, these are fine

Great tissues per usual. Just note that the box is on the bigger side in case you are using it with any holder.

NICE AND SOFT

Soft tissue

I use this brand when I have a runny nose because it's softer and doesn't make my nose as sore.  It is durable.

Good price and great quality. I use them a lot during allergy season.

Wow this is seriously soft..

My noise loved it

These come in longer boxes and are very easy to remove one at a time. Nice and soft on the old runny nose.

Good product.

My nose really like these tissues - soft and good quality.

This is probably my fault but I didn’t know your skin cannot touch these and they stain your shower

Leaves permanent  stain on  floor.. Scrubbed with soft scrub  and bleach. Faded a little but still there. Fllor one year old! Terrible product.Should at least get a refund! Also  I gifted one and had to tell the person not to use it!

Not sure what type of colorants they're using but they will stain your shower/tub depending in the material. The point of these is to last and not melt and dissolve immediately so putting it to the side to dissolve slowly is the goal. What's not the goal is the long term damage to your shower/tub. Beware the orange and blue colored steamers.This would probably be fine on regular tile.

I would give it a "zero" star if i had to. So unhappy with this brand. I was expecting a good "quality" product but it's so disappointing. The packaging makes you think it's good quality. It does not release any scent at all in the shower or if it does it's so very minimal like really ! It's a total waste of money. I wish I could return it once opened. I used VapoShower which was great ! I'm switching back and dumping this.

The sales pitch section of this product post says it’s sulfate-free. I bought it and saw upon reading the package that it actually does contain sodium lauryl sulfate! I went back to the Amazon post and saw that if you scroll -way- down to the actual ingredient list, it accurately lists the same ingredients as the package.  So buyer beware and read the fine print. Ridiculous amount of effort to buy a simple shower steamer.

I  was really looking forward to trying this product and experiencing  the benefits of an aromatherapy shower.  However,  there was no scent at all that I could detect.  The packaging is pretty and I considered buying more for gifts before I tried it myself.  Sorry, but I can not recommend this product.

The box was really nice, but I couldn't smell the scents at all in the shower. I tried several different places, but still no luck unless it was directly under the running water and then you still had to bend down to smell it at all. I would not buy this product again.  I have used other brands that did really well.

I made this purchase for the Eucalyptus and Peppermint scents. I got my order today and was super excited to use it. The scents in the box filled the room. Put in the shower and it dissolved quicker than ever. It smells louder in the room than in the shower. The box presentation was very pretty. I would not purchase them again though. Sorry.

I really wanted to enjoy this product. I used the lavender scented one and it didn't steam up in my shower. I am disappointed. Sorry i didn't think to take a picture of it not working in my shower while I was taking a shower. Maybe I didn't do it correctly or something. I'm going to try using again.

I was really looking forward too these shower bombs only to be disappointed. The discription made it sound you would need no other shower bombs. Not!! The flavors were exciting but the product did not deliver. Permotes to use half of a disc since fragrance is strong. Nope..Not worth the hype

It did absolutely nothing

Don’t waste your money on this one - I’ve gone through every scent - while they smell just fine coming out of the package they do nothing when moisture is added - I’ve placed them in all different locations within the shower and nothing. You’re better off using essential oil in a diffuser on the bathroom counter.

BEWARE!!!  These will stain your shower.  They are neon, super pigmented colors and will permanently discolor any lighter colored grout.

All the fragrances smell the same. They just melt in the shower, can’t smell the fragrance in the shower at all. You can however smell the strong soap aroma from the box.

This is probably my fault but I didn’t know your skin cannot touch these and they stain your shower. Also they don’t smell.Terrible purchase.

Save your money.Packaging was a pain….especially if you had wet hands.Smell is barely noticeable and is drowned out by your soap/shampoo.Bleh.

I used a whole tablet in my small, stand up shower and smelled absolutely nothing. I tried another scent and again, there was no scent. A total waste of money

Does not do a good job as a steamer tablet. Barely smells when you have it in the shower.

Didn't do much of anything for our shower.

Gave as a gift. My friend told me there was no aroma and dissolved too quickly. They did not work.

Disappointed with this product. The packaging is nice & these smell good in the package but in the shower they barely have any scent. I would not buy this again.

The idea of this product was really great however, it didn’t work at all. Used 3 different times. It was a flop sadly.

I bought these for my grandkids, but I had to throw them away because they smelled awful.

Faint scent , no moisturizing capabilities and while it’s a pretty box, I wouldn’t give this to anyone…No value

Save your money, they don't work at all

There was no steam no smell no nothing. Waste of money.

This was ridiculous! There was no gift bag no card. The wording I selected to be printed on the gift card what type on the tiny flimsy piece of paper, and There was a drawing on the packaging that I guessed meant to simulate a gift bag. How absurd!

I didn't like anything about this product.  I would  not buy again.  Did not have a smell to them, didn't steam either.

My mistake. I won't be purchasing these again.

When you open the bag you think they will be very fragrant but you can smell them at all in the shower!

I don’t know if I got a really old batch or what but I’ve tried two different ones so far and neither one had any scent whatsoever.

Too much fuss for nothing. Okay, they are packaged attractively & would make a nice little hostess gift or for a female that you don't know well (very feminally packaged for most males), but that is about it. Some give off very little scent and the scent profiles are all too similar (orange, lavender & eucalyptus/mint). My eyes stung from the mint much longer than the scent lasted. I have a pretty darn good sniffer, right now too.I had no problem with staining, even with a little spot that was inadvertently left over night. If you want an inexpensive innocuous gift this would be good. If you are looking for a shower bomb that provides fragrance that enlivens you or calms the spirit look further or DIY your own. They are easy and you can control what fragrance and how much of it you would like.Oh! The thing I really did appreciate about this set was the little Ziploc package that you could store a bomb in. No Doubt a regular Ziploc bag would work but this was prettier and heavyweight. As I did not want to keep all the bombs in a jar in my shower area for fear that it would degrade them quicker. It was really helpful to pop one in the package when I turned on the bathroom heater and put just that one in the shower area to make sure that I wouldn't forget to take it in the shower with me when I finally wandered in to take my shower.

My oldest daughter gifted me something similar and I enjoyed the gift. She shared with me how much she loves shower steamers. I saw these were reduced and decided to try them since I had used the ones from my daughter.My package was amazing. I came with a tool to snip the wrapping off and a storage bag to store half the disk if you choose to use half. So I was very excited to share this with my daughter so I ordered one for her.When she received her package, it was TOTALLY DIFFERENT! It did not come with any of the items mine had even though I used the exact same link. Needless to say I am very disappointed.I gave two stars only because she was thankful for the surprise and love the streamers regardless of what was not in her package.

nothing happens when you put them in water not worth the money

I got these to put in stockings. They all smell the same, and it’s a smell that is a bit like a truck stop urinal cake. Not pleasant. There is a note in the package encouraging you to return them if you don’t like the smell, however the effort to return them was more than the effort to just throw them away.On the flip side, the package was cute and it arrived in a timely fashion.

Won’t buy again

Stained my tub

These have a very strong scent for in the shower however they do not last very long

These would probably be great in a bath, or a small enclosed shower. In a large shower, they just don't do much, you're too far away to reap any benefits.They do smell great though.

To me it doesnt work... put it on the floor of my shower in the corner, got wet and couldnt smell it. The scent of my soap overpowered it and my soap doesnt have a strong scents

Moved it in several places in the shower and never did it really ever have an aroma that I could detect.

They smell nice in the packaging, but they do not have a lot of scent in the shower. After using them, my face was very irritated and burning. Scared to use again!

Gave these to my mom for Mother's Day and she says they don't smell like much in the shower and was pretty disappointed.

But these for my wife and thought i would be nice for her in shower and they hardly smell of anything. Would not buy again.

They have very little scent.  Not what I wanted or expected.

Didn’t really feel like aromatic

I put it in 3 different spots in shower. Barley permeated the shower

There was practically no scent to this item.

Great aroma but lacks longevity.

I am hating the eucalyptus mint ones. They are so gross and the smell really permeates everything. I can hardly stand to be in the same room with an open one with the door closed. I was hoping the mint smell would be refreshing and help to discourage spiders from taking up residence in the bathrooms, but it smells more like BO to me than mint- maybe that's the eucalyptus? Pleasantness of scents tends to be subjective so maybe this one's just not for me. I gave this a second star (even though the scent is a one star for me) because it does have a very strong scent that would be nice, were the scent a good one. The only smell I've found in aromatherapy that I've hated this much is pachoulli, and that kind of reads as BO to my nose too. So maybe if you don't like patchouli, skip this one.

While these were wonderful, i was a bit overwhelmed by how strong the scent is with the steamers.

The smell hits you the moment you open the package and almost impossible to tell the difference between the smells when you first open it.  The round tablets have a dip that allows you to cut it in half - cut, not break - but it would better if it was possible to cut it into four separate pieces. That said, the smell doesn't last long once the shower starts.  By the time I was done with the shower - I take short ones - the smell was no longer around.  You would think that as strong as they smelled when first opened the smell would stick around but it doesn't.  I would not gift this to anyone due to the initial strong smell.  I ended up putting the box and remaining tablets in a freezer baggie to contain the smell.

I bought these for a small gift for friends.  I read the instructions and circled some of them BUTNO WHERE DOES IT SAY HOW TO USE THESE...DROP THEM ON THE FLOOR?  THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH ONE'S BODY.  EXPLAIN HOW TO USE THEM BETTER.THEY WERE PACKAGED FINE AND LOVED THE SCENT, BUT I TAKE BATHS SO DID NOT USE THEM.

I love the concept of these and most smell good, some are over powering and best to use just half. Downside, they last like five minutes and they are dissolved and gone.

While the prices for these shower steamers is ok, the product itself is not really what I was expecting. For a quick add on gift to something else it's alright but not for an actual gift alone. The scent is very dull and it disappeared so quickly I didn't get a chance to enjoy them. I will not be purchasing these for myself or anyone I care for. Just keep in mind, this is my personal opinion on the product. I really expected a bit more from these.

It does give a nice smell. Not what I expect it, but it all depends. I wanted the smell to last longer.

Would not buy again, debating on returning.

The tablet disappeared immediately as soon as the water came near it and there was no smell filling the bathroom as it melted. Will not order this again, so not pleased!!

No scent in the bathroom.able to use for more than one shower.Loved being able to use half of a tablet at a time.Disappointed with no aromatherapy when showering.Did not return it bc I started using them but will not purchase again.

I used half a tablet as directed for a shower 15 min or less. I placed the tablet out of the hard stream of water. The tablet dissolved too quickly and I didn't get the help from aromatherapy I was hoping for. Will not buy again.

I prefer a stronger aroma-I couldn’t really tell what the scent was

I was so excitted to get these. The first one was the best!!!! But out of 8 only 1 worked. So depressing. I just wished they could all have a scent. But my lesson.

Not very fragrant - and I have a closed shower so the smell should fill it up. Very subtle smells - almost not there. Nicely packaged. But I definitely wouldnt buy again.

You can smell up to your nose but I didn't find it to be a real scent giver upon steam showering.

It doesn't steam or smell as much as I would like. Going to try something else.

The smell is great before  my shower.  Not sommuch in the shower.

They smell great but the smell is not strong and it dissolves too fast!

Not as strong in the shower but you can smell them

Expected stronger smells in shower

Packaging and presentation were good, but scent was not distinguishable and was short-lived.

-I am not a fan of the scent of these.  I feel like they almost have a citronella (bug spray) smell to them instead of eucalyptus.-They are the perfect size and dissolve well in the shower.-The packaging is nice.

Got for stocking stuffers. Think I will have to double or triple bag them so the whole room isn’t overpowered.

We have tried a lot of shower steamers this year, and these are adequate but not our favorites. Of the several sets we tried, this is the only one to come pre-scored, allowing one to snap the steamers in half for more uses. This is a nice feature, as many shower steamers last for 2 or 3 showers anyway, and many of the half-steamers from this set also worked for about 1.5 showers. The scents were pleasant, and the steamers are brightly colored (though I prefer mine untinted). At $20 for 8 (at time of review), these are among the most expensive steamers I have tried, and I don't know that they are any better than the other sets available at half the price per steamer (or less), but if this fits your budget they are certainly adequate.

It didn’t last long enough nor smell strong enough

It all dissolved in no time. so-so

I loved the variety of these. I found a scent that quickly became my favorite and now I want to buy an entire set of just that scent. Some of the scents weren’t for me personally, but they were all still very strong. The size is perfect for a few showers so long as you don’t put it directly under the water.

All the popchose products I've used have been great.  Their shower steamers are amazing

I am not sure why there is no real scent in the shower since that to me is the whole point of having them.  Moved them several places and eventually up to the shelf literally right under my face and still no real scent in the shower.  Scent when open, scents the room, scents the bathroom while it sits between uses.  No distinct smell of what it says on the package.  A hint when first opened but that is it.  So - I will continue to look around, this was a good price, but after using the entire box I just can't buy it again.

They smell very good love them

I purchased this to give as a gift so all that I can say is that it came in quickly and was what I expected.

Hot damn finally found a product that my teen will shower everyday win win for me

They are larger than most and if you take longer showers, I think the full tablet would work.  Half works just as well.  Nice lasting scents.

You can break it in two and use twice

The shower and whole bathroom smells good using this product.  I so enjoyed it.

I wish the scent was stronger but I love having them in the shower.

Great product just some smells are overbearing.

The tangerine Mandarin didn't really have much of a scent or a smell. It lasts a long time there's still a chunk in my shower that didn't disintegrate. I'd try it again in a bigger shower next time.

I loved the aroma that released cause the whole bathroom turns into a spa

Would give 5 stars if last a little longer  but good product and smell real good

Was a gift not for me

These are fantastic at clearing your sinuses without being overwhelming. A nice aromatic, relaxing shower is in store for whoever uses it.

These are probably the strongest shower steamers I’ve ever used. It has such a strong menthol smell it actually made my eyes water a bit. These would be perfect if you’re sick or have a stuffy nose — they definitely open the sinuses!

These steamers have a good amount of scent which is nice, but they do seem to dissolve quicker than other steamers I have used in the past.  They come in a large resealable bag and then each steamer is also individually sealed.

These POPCHOSE Shower Steamers Aromatherapy - 8 Pack Shower Tablets for Self Care & SPA Relaxation - Mothers Day Gifts, Teacher Appreciation Gifts, Birthday Gifts for Women, Mom, Men Who Have Everything give the option to break them in half, but because I normally take longer showers, I used them whole. They last long enough if you keep them to the side and don’t expose them to too much water. I have a rather small shower that is enclosed in glass, and the aroma was just strong enough for me. The scent may not be strong enough if you shower in a larger shower or bathtub that is not enclosed.

I was introduced to Shower Steamers this year, they still make a nice addition for a relaxing shower when you do not have time or the ability to take a bath. This one makes an interesting suggestion “Pick the tablet scent you like, remove the plastic film, snap half of the tablet, store the other half in the sealable bag in the package, and place our POPCHOSE steamer tablet on the floor where there is no heavy stream that prevents it from being submerged, but is water going through.”They even have it scored for you to easily split it in half. They include a packet to put the other spare half into. You do need to keep these at the back of your shower/away from the bulk of the running water so that they do not wash away right away. They also work best in hot showers, which then let the scents rise up.You get 8 different scents: Lavender, Chamomile and Rose, Sage and Patchouli, Orange and Vanilla, Lemon and Mandarin, Menthol and Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and then Grapefruit. This is a great combo of scents for anyone who doesn't care for the overly floral ones. I did find that these were as strong as others scent-wise, they were well wrapped so there was not a lot of the scent leaking out of the box, which is nice. I often need to store them in some sort of zip-lock bag.

This came in a pack of 8 with different scents. The steamers had all smelled good but sometimes they were a little hard to smell in the shower. Overall I like them.

The tablet were fragrant and had unique scents. Each tablet can be broken into two pieces. The second leftover piece can be stored in an included bag. I used the whole tablet and found the experiencing to be relaxing.

I've tried several of these packages of assorted fragrances of shower steamers. What makes this one stand out from all the rest is the unique, scored 'cut' line that lets you choose to use only half of a steamer at a time.Personally, my showers rarely exceed 15 minutes in duration, so based on the recommendation on the package I tried out my first tablet by only using half of it. While I like steamers, I do not like how some can be overly intense. Using just half fit my need just right. (I may even see how using ¼ tablet will work in the future.)You get 8 tablets, which is 16 showers' worth for me, in the package. A resealable little pouch to store the unused half of a tablet is a nice touch.While I appreciate this sampler style package to try out the different scents, I'd like to be able to order packages of single aroma tablets once I've decided on my personal fragrance preferences.

Smells amazing

I could smell these before I even removed the plastic wrap and opened the box, they are very fragrant. Bright, cheery colors and aromatic large tablets in a variety of scents. They even provide a zip type plastic bag to store the other 1/2 in if you cut or break one in 1/2 for a shorter timed shower.

My wife and I had a chance to test these out in the shower recently and it was a lot of fun.  It comes with 8 scented "tablets" (they kind of look like very large vitamins) that you break in half.  We placed at at the base of the shower and at first it seemed like not much was happening.  We splashed a bit of water on it while trying to keep it largely out of the water so as not to cause it to dissolve too quickly.  The scent started off slowly at first, but within a few minutes it really got going.  By the end of the 15-20 minute shower we still had most of the portion we used left.  I have a pretty sensitive nose so I found that keeping it at a distance was best for me.  The aroma was still strong enough too experience but not too strong.  Overall it was a great experience and product.  The packaging is great, and for the price, it's hard to go wrong!

I decided to get the POPCHOSE Shower Steamers Aromatherapy for my daughter's Christmas stocking. Since she no longer has a bathtub, I wanted to find an alternative to traditional bath bombs. Although I don't have a firsthand experience with them, my daughter seemed to enjoy them. She mentioned that they were a nice addition to her shower routine and even said she would be interested in getting them again. Overall, I'd say they were a hit!

I got these for my mom and she loves them. She breaks them in half and said that half lasts here quite a while, definitely long enough for a whole shower. Sometimes she even has some left over and just uses the rest of it the next time she showers. She said that the smells are strong but not over powering and are all “lovely”. She also likes that they’re vegan, made with natural essential oils, and cruelty free. It comes in a nice little box and has some really great scents. Her favourite is the chamomile and rose but she said they’re all great.

I usually use Bath and Body Works shower steamers, but I've been looking for something cheaper for when they aren't on sale, lol. These smell great, and I was excited that it said you can use them in halves because my husband takes very fast showers, but he also likes aromatherapy. These aren't scored for breaking in half, but they do break in half.I would make a few suggestions to the company:-I prefer white shower steamers to colors - I find the colors startling and less relaxing-The clear bag/wrapping around the tablet needs to be easier to remove-The tablets would be easier to break in half if they were scored

You know those people you are obligated to buy gifts for that never really like anything?? Get them these!! The packaging is pretty, the scents are lovely and who doesn’t love a spa-like shower experience??Well, I’m sure my mom found something wrong with them, but, in the moment, they were well received and she mentions it positively each time she has used one.

I love these steamers. I love the fact that you dont have to use the whole thing. You can break these in half. The scents are strong and crisp leaving a fresh effect. These are really great steamers.

Incredible shower experience with POPCHOSE Shower Steamers Aromatherapy! The 8 Pack of split-in-half shower tablets transforms my shower into a spa-like retreat. The aromatherapy is divine, creating a soothing atmosphere. It didn't create as much bliss as I thought from the steam, nor did it melt as fast. I like that each tablet is can be used whole or halfed.

Great for long hot showers. Smell is quite strong so you don’t need to use a whole tablet at once.

These shower steamers come as a gift presentation and the box smells so good before it is even opened. There is an extra bag inside because they can be broke in two, so you couuld get 16 uses out of the one box.  There are 8 different scents like lavender, peach, mint and so so on.  Very nice, they work well in the shower and nice to have choice of aromas.

These are seriously amazing products! They thought of everything you will need including a little plastic pick to help open plastic wrap and a small resealable bag to put 2nd half of steamer so it doesn't lose smell before using. I love all the different scents and that makes it a great gift since everyone has different scent preferences. Half of a steamer is the perfect amount for a 15-20 minute shower, if not longer. The packaging and appearance is also great, it looks very fancy for a great price. Highly recommend!!

After opening the beautifully packaged box, you can tell you're in for a treat. The beautiful scents instantly transport you to a calm world of relaxation and well-being. I've tried numerous aromatherapy products in the past, but these tablets genuinely stand out.Steam Shower Diffusers are very easy to use, just remove them from the foil and place them on the edge of the shower. Water splashes on them to release the scent.

I have a small bathroom and take short showers and these have a line down the middle so you can easily break them in half which is great cause I only need a half for my showers and I don't feel like I'm wasting a whole one that's not done dissolving when I'm done. They smell great but not too strong so it's not overwhelming in my small bathroom.

This is a wonderful product to use for personal use or gifting. The variety of scents leaves me excited to use more of the shower steamers. The scent lasts in the bathroom well after you finish taking a shower. The scent will even stick to your body. This is a great product to use or gift. I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in taking their showers to the next level.

I was a little hesitant at first about this product but to my surprise it works very well. It's about the size of a hockey puck but you don't need the whole thing. You can break it in half and that was more than enough for me. It starts dissolving as soon as water touches it but it lasts for your whole shower. The fragrance from it was very nice (be sure you pick the scents you like). It was nice to use after a long day at work, take a nice long shower, it helps you relax. I would recommend it, it makes a great gift as well.

The box contains 8 individually wrapped steam shower diffusers in a variety of scents. They are beautifully decorated. When I first opened it, I could smell a fragrance. When I put it in the bathtub, it quickly dissolved in the water and the bathroom was immediately filled with a pleasant scent. By using them, I got a unique shower steam experience. It's a great form of relaxation and aromatherapy.

They smell great in the box. In the shower dissolved quickly. Nice idea for a gift. Great customer service!

These smell pleasant and are not overpowering. Some give me headaches, but these do not.It dissolves easily but doesn't go too quickly. I used a full tablet and a half tablet (easily breaks in half along the line) and found both to be useful depending on how long your showers are. If you take long showers, use the full tablet. I recommend trying half to see how long it lasts, and adjust that way. I've tried using it by placing it on the tub floor and on the soap holder on the wall. Both work great with the soap holder lasting longer compared to having it on the floor.I recommend this if you are looking for a nice, relaxing shower with a pleasant aroma.

Very nice product. All the scents smell good. I use only half of the tablet; the scent is very subtle yet still effective. I ensure I rinse the residue from the dissolved scent to prevent any staining.

These shower steamers are really nice if you shower before bed or shower in the morning before work. You get 8 different scents to pick from. I used Chamomile Rose this morning and I absolutely loved it. You get a feeling of being at the spa. These scents all smell amazing. There’s nothing like pure relaxation before getting ready for work or getting ready for bed.

They all smell so good and you can actually smell them from the packaging. I tried Orange Vanilla and Peppermint.  It’s a nice experience in the shower. I tried a few and gave the rest away to my mom and girlfriend as gifts. They are individually wrapped so that made it easy to gift. It also came with a blank card.

I am happy to use the shower streamers as it inclues 8 different scent with such good price. I am impressed by all the eight scents as they smell good.

We get total of 8 tablets with different perfume that can be used in shower, but I use half tablet per shower and it's still left so half tablet will work for 2 showers and the aroma is so amazing, this serves as best gift for my coming holiday season.

Maybe I got a bad batch or something but since I bought these, I’ve used about 3 and none have work. I can only smell them if i pick them and even then they don’t really smell as strong as advertised. Only giving 2 stars because while they do smell faintly good when i pick them up.update: seller reached out to me and sent me a new box shortly after, and I can confirm that the steamers work, first box might just have been a fluke. The mint one is my favorite.

So refreshing to receive these scented shower tablets and have them just as described.  I bought these for a beach vacation group.  Nice to be able to put a quality item into the guests beach gift bags.  I got and opened 1 set and they are very well packaged, had all the items mentioned in purchase site and smelled really good.  I know my guests will love them.  Thank you for a quality product!!

Bought these as a gift for my elderly mom, she really enjoys them.

These are great! They smell really good and make my kids really want to shower.

I love all 8 different scent as they help me relax when I take a shower.  I will buy again.

this was a great purchase for my family. everyone enjoyed using the shower steamers! great long lasting scents that werent too overpowering.  only suggestion, make the plastic on the actual tablets easier to open

These scents are loved by everyone in my family and meets many different ideals on what is the favorite scent.  Some deliver aroma therapy to helping opening up sinuses.  A must have!

Bought these as a gift for my wife and she loved them!  Favorites were the jasmine and lavender scents, but all of the scents were good.

I absolutely love these scents. They are strong and last for a while!I definitely recommend getting the variety pack so you get to experience a few different scents. My favorite is the Lavender.

I purchased for Mothers Day presents. Not everyone enjoys baths or has time but these are the perfect alternative. You still get a relaxing and therapeutic aroma in a shower!Easy to use, doesn’t make the floor slippery as they dissolve, not over powering scent.

They don't give off an Aroma like they smell in the package

I have never used shower steamers before but I just had a chance to use my first one. Let me just say, what a great smell. The lavender smell is relaxing while I am taking a shower. I will probably order these again when I run out. The dissolve while you shower and let out the aroma making the whole bathroom smell great. The smell lasted at least two days. My wife commented how good our bathroom smelled afterwards. Love it!

I’m very sensitive to artificial fragrance, and these do not seem to irritate my nose and eyes. The scents don’t necessarily smell like what they are labeled, but it’s a good scent for the shower. It comes with a bag to store the puck between uses. Great for those who love aromatherapeutic things.

A great variety of scents, nicely packaged and a wonderful addition to gift bags for your best friends! I also liked the instructions or using a half or a whole.  Very helpful!

Initially I ordered these for myself and loved them. Now I order these often and given them as gifts. Feedback from the recipients has been very positive.

It makes my feet softer

The POPCHOSE Shower Steamers Aromatherapy - 8 Pack Shower Tablets provide a spa-like experiance in your own home.  The scents are so nice and not overpowering.

Bought for Christmas gift so I can’t comment on how they smell or work. Nicely packed fast delivery

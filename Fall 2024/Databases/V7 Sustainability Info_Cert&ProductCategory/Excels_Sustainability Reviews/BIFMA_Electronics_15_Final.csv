It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",-2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I'm feeling far more alert both during and after work. While standing, I'm much more mobile. I no longer need to ""get up and go get coffee."" I can just ""go get coffee."" That might not sound like much, but it's a big difference. While sitting, I'm far more comfortable, since the keyboard and screens are positioned at the correct heights for me.I'm standing about 75% of the day. I didn't need any time to ""ramp up"" to this level, but I'm also on the younger side. I do have a soft mat to stand on, since the office floors are concrete underneath thin carpeting.Set-up was easy, but I took my time to do things cleanly. Took about 90 minutes. They include some channeling for your cables, which was a nice touch. You may want to have a few spare zip-ties though. One tip: wait until the end to attach the writing surface, otherwise, the bracket that holds it down will get in the way of one of the tension adjustment screws. A second tip: have a ratcheting screwdriver with a couple of phillips bits, allen bits, and and sockets handy.The product is sturdy and well-built. A lot of the component parts are plastic, but I don't have any concerns about them breaking. It's made in China, which I'm not enthusiastic about, but there weren't any American alternatives that were similar in design. I considered purchasing one of the Kangaroo series workstations from Ergopro, but it didn't have the clamp to secure it to the desk, or the separate platforms for typing and writing.I've had to do some work at clients' offices these past two weeks as well, where I didn't have the Ergotron. It was miserable, haha. I'm probably going to end up buying another one of these for home, or better yet, convince my company to buy them for the office, so I can take this one back home for personal use. Several colleagues have already shown interest in getting them, so it's a possibility. Remember, if you buy it on your own, that's using post-tax dollars. If you can get your company to buy them, they can probably finagle a bulk discount, and they can use pre-tax dollars on it. It takes small bite out of their bottom line, but definitely pays for itself in productivity boosts, and when each unit is only a few hundred bucks, they can definitely find the budget.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": -1, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The cheaper ones are no more than clugs with badly fitting parts and whose screws need to be loosened, if they haven't been stripped, if you want to move the monitor position. In its price range and above I haven't yet found a decent competitor except for the Humanscale M2 or M8. The LX is a well made, nicely designed, unit well worth the price.At first, it wouldn't hold my monitor up -- the upper arm kept sinking -- and yet my monitor, at 15.4 lbs., was well below the 20 lb. max capacity for this unit. The adjustment for the weight of the monitor is #2 on the scant pictographic instructions. The picture instructions are not the best--not the worst but. . . Anyway I searched for an adjustment to the spring-tension canister in the upper arm that counterbalances the monitor's weight. Pushing the upper arm up and the screen mount down reveals the adjustment screw head at the end of the canister and the larger supplied wrench fits it. 3 half-turns clockwise made no diff. So I added three more half-turns; better but still slowly sinking. I added a 3 more half-turns--much better. 3 more for a total of 12 half-turns and the balance was perfect. You need to ease your way up to the right number of turns to get it just right balance and to avoid overtightening. Once adjusted correctly, the montoro stays in palce but can be moved easily up and down.What's nice about this unit is that, once you have it set up, you can move the monitor around and up and down without readjusting the tension or loosening/retigthening any screws. Although, if your desk is on casters or wheels, you will want to lock them, which is a good safety rule anyway. The elevation movement is smooth and easy--you can move it up or down with one finger. The horizontal swing movement is much stiffer. It helps if you spray the two large post joints with silicone lubricant liberally and then wipe away thoroughly all of the excess. This won't make the swing movement light, but it does ease it up a bit. By post joints I mean the large joints where the upper arm meets the lower and were the lower arm meets the desk mounting post. These joints have no bearings; they have plastic sleeve-type bushings. Compared to the Humanscale: the Humanscale moves horizontally as easily as the LX moves vertically while the Humanscale moves vertically as stiffly as the LX moves horizonstally--either way I'm not sure the difference is worth the extra money for the Humanscale. This stiff horizontal movement is less than ideal but far better than what I've seen on some of the cheaper units offer. For this price I could live with stiffness given all the other postive features.The LX comes with a heavy duty clamp base and a drill-a-hole-in-the-desk grommet type mount--both come in the box. All of the parts are in a two-layer plastic strip, sealed into multiple compartments with each compartment labeled as to contents. Much better than those units that come with all the screws etc. all in one bag and you have to sort them by count and looks against their picture in the instructions.It's not quite as pretty as the Humanscale M2 or M8, which cost about 60% more, but much more nicely finished than the cheaper units I've seen up close. The LX, with less attractive desk mounting pole, has a greater range of vertical position than the Humanscale.If you can afford it, this monitor arm is a very good choice. If you can afford more, then it's a tough choice between this at its price vs the Humanscale arms at the higher prices. For the money, this is a much better deal, thus, my rating of 5 stars.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

Also the box looked warn and everything about it feels like I got porked into paying for a new item but received a clearly used and worn one.  The problem is I need this now and don't have 2 weeks to wait for another one.  First time I've ever had to submit a negative review of something I purchased on Amazon.  And it's too bad Ergotron has to get a low review from a customer because of Ingram's poor service. I would imaging that this LX Arm would be nice if it didn't seem like it was used for the last year.  It doesn't seem tight and the adjustments don't hold the secondary pivot arm in place that well.  The construction quality is pretty good, but again it seems like it was used by someone at Ingram for a while before they packaged it back up and shipped it out to me.

If you aren't, ignore the following.If you want to save 40 dollars, and improve upon what you bought, go to the hardware store, buy a 1"" schedule 80 pre threaded aluminum tube, and please buy aluminum the base is also cast aluminum and if you cheap out and buy cast iron, you will have serious problems with the base and tube welding itself together and destroying whatever paint or coating you use to finish your new tube.  And yes, you need schedule 80 tubing if you're making it longer.  Take apart your stand, its 3 screws holding on a plate that hides the threaded portion of the stand, and remove 3 more insert screws around the circumference of the base.  From there you should be able to easily unscrew the tube, though if you have trouble, use a bit of heat and can easily remove your old tube.From here on, cut your new tube arm to your desired length, file the sharp edges, paint it black, take your old tube cap off, pop it on the new one, and reassemble.  At most you're spending 5 dollars on aluminum tubing, and 5 more on a pipe cutter if you don't have one or a saw.  The tube itself should take well to any kind of paint, or you can just leave it unpainted because aluminum doesn't rust for that hip industrial look.The rest of the arm itself is really well built, if annoying to adjust as it has a very limited range of motion, and the process of finely tuning exactly where the dials need to sit so you can actually move the arms, is unfathomably narrow.  Too much and you're fighting the arm to move it up, too little and your monitor is dragging the arm down.  After messing around with it for far too long, I took it apart, degreased and regreased all the parts, and it adjusted a lot better.That being said, while the build quality is pretty outstanding, its got too many problems to recommend in the slightest.You get what you pay for, but that's it unfortunately.  With a bit of work, you could make it absolutely exceptional.  But to pay an extra 40 dollars for a longer tube is absurd, and an extra 10 on that for white paint, is worse.  Just spend the 200 dollars and get something better, with a wider, more easily done degree of adjustment.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 1, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Gamut,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2012",4.0,"I really like the quality of these Ergotron arms. They are less expensive than those by Humanscale, they offer more add-on options, and they look great. The packaging was perfect and they provide enough hardware to bolt-mount or clamp the arms, even providing extra screws. The instructions were above average compared to what we usually get with hardware and other equipment these days.I am giving these four instead of five only because they are still not tall enough, even being the tall version of these poles. I have a console desk (you know, the ones that have a monitor riser built-in) and I used these to expand it to accommodate both standing and sitting work situations. The height of the console desk is a standard 40 inches and these arms/posts are just three inches shy of putting the monitors where a six-foot person needs them to be when standing and with the arms extended to maximum height, positioned at the top of the poles, and with all four mounting points bolted. I wound up inserting an inch-thick board on top of the surface where the clamp attaches (the surface is glass anyhow, bottom of the clamp gripping the metal chassis) and I bolted the top edge of the mounting bracket to the bottom two holes on the monitors as a quick fix. This works for now when I adjust the height from the arm and *not* the monitor, but I am still going to need to add some more metal reinforcement so that someone unaware of this doesn't break the monitor's plastic backing. I am not comfortable with only two of the four mount points being used anyhow. I also wish that the clamp could have been extended an additional inch but I doubt that Ergotron's engineers predicted that their monitor arms would be used for this type of solution. (hey guys, if you're reading this, here is a cool way to use your product and you're oh-so-close to being ready for this, out of the box!)Although I could have just gotten a single arm with the dual-monitor version, I got two of these to mount each of my two monitors independently and from the opposing left and right edges of my desktop.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

Schimmelman,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2014",2.0,"I bought this to replace an arm that I had been using for over 15 years and finally gave it up.  It only died because of a manufacturing defect that took that long to break.  This arm is a similar design, but much more sleek and stylish.  It has more vertical and extension distances and the friction settings were perfect right out of the box.  It looks good and is heavy duty, using aluminum alloy parts.  Now for the modification part.My screen is above me when I'm in my easy chair, so it needs to tip down.  Several other reviewers have complained that it only tips down a slight amount, and it's true.  It's right there in the spec.  For some unknown reason they bent a couple small tabs from the steel part of the pivot so they hit against the aluminum casting to limit the tip.  It would be easy to grind the tabs off or grind the aluminum down with a dremel tool, but that would scatter metal dust and grinding powder all over and make a mess.Instead, I took a small pair of vise grips and took a deep grip on the tab, but not real tight, and used a bit of squeezing and bending to straighten it up about 2/3 of the way.  Then I took a tighter grip with the end of the tool right at the bend point and straightened it almost all the way.  Finally I took another deep grip that was tight to smooth out the metal at the bend.  Do that for both sides and in about 10 minutes your screen will pivot down, and there's no mess and nothing to paint.They could have eliminated a manufacturing step and produced a better project.  What were they thinking?I haven't noticed any side effects.  It holds the wires better than my other arm, and was 1/3 the price.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I have one monitor for my computer and I mounted a second (and identical) 21"" monitor on my office wall so that clients can see what I am looking at on my screen.  I am a lawyer. When I wantto review long documents with clients before signing, I simply move the second monitor away from its parking space on the wall to a convenient place for my clients to read the screen.  If we identify anything we want to change, I make the changes without wasting a lot of printing time and paper. When the document is perfect, we print it out once and sign.The Ergotron LX Wall Mount LCD Arm has worked well for me.  The tension in the arms is adjustable, so I can match the arm to the weight of the Samsung SyncMaster 213T 21"" LCD Flat Panel Monitor and it holds its position well.  When we are done using the monitor, I can collapse the arm against the wall and the second monitor is out of the way.  The Ergotron LX Wall Mount LCD Arm has a good appearance as well; it does not look cheesy.The whole trick here is to make sure the unit is solidly bolted onto the wall.  I didn't use a mounting plate, but you might have to if you don't have a convenient stud location in the wall.  The Ergotron LX has plastic covers (also not cheesy) that hide the wall bolts and gives the unit a nice look.  There is no getting away from the power and video cables that feed the monitor, but the Ergotron LX does as well as can expected to hide as much of the cabling as possible.  I am very satisfied and not all that easy to please.  I recommend this product.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Sherman,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022",5.0,"This monitor arm is extremely well made, durable and a lot more heavy then I thought it would be.  So, overall the construction of the arm and it's design is very well made, heavy solid materials.  It comes shipped in a great packaging, it's nice to see care in how much care went into packing.  The assembly is relatively easy with just 3 parts that connect with a few screws to tighten.  I'm using this arm with an LG 38"" Ultra Wide monitor that I believe is about 15lbs in weight and it can easily move around without struggle on the arm.If you have a lighter monitor or a smaller sized one, you may have difficulty with the arm keeping a monitor in a low position.  If the monitor is light weight < 12-13lbs it may want to lift up on it's own due to the heavy spring action.  I had a smaller monitor on it while waiting for my ultra-wide and it was kind of comical.  I added weight to the monitor to keep it down a bit.It supports VESA 100x100 and 200x200 on the mounting bracket.  I feel like this is a good standard for newer monitors.  The mount is sturdy and supports a really good range of movement tilting up and down as well as a full rotation on it's side.  The arm movement is really reasonable in it's range of movement.  I'm even able to drop my monitor down a bit lower than the clamp.The arm assembly also includes options to mount the arm with a desk clamp, or through a drilled hole.  It has good options for mounting the arm as needed.I'm really satisfied with this purchase and can see this arm lasting a really long time - probably much longer than my new monitor.  I highly recommend getting it.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

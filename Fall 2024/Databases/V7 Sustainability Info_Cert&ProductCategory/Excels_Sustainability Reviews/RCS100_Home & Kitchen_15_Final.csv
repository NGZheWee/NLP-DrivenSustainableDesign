These curtains are sheer and they are white. Is that worth 2 stars? I don't think so. Now the rest: we measured CAREFULLY. The curtain rods height were pegged at exactly the height so the curtains would hang one inch off the floor. They were installed to exact measurements using a laser level. We worked out where the rod holders would be mounted so that there was no unsupported rod length over 4 feet, and the curtains would hang properly where we want them to. Each box contained 2 curtains. Each curtain was carefully unfolded and hand ironed. We even cleaned the floor around the ironing area so the curtains would not pick up any dust/dirt. Then they were hung one by one, 8 panels. As we stood back to admire them, I noticed they weren't hanging evenly at the floor. So we set about fidgeting with them, nothing made any difference. Then we measured the drapes, from the perfectly aligned curtain rods to the floor. Oh boy. Some were over 2 inches shorter than they were supposed to be. Some were touching the floor - longer than they're supposed to be. None actually matched. Three of the panels actually are too long on one side and too short on the other side, in the same curtain. We took out the laser level and checked the curtain rods again. Exactly spot on straight and level, even around a corner. Now we knew it was the curtains themselves. It's ridiculous how off they are, it's not even close. Now, floors themselves are rarely level, especially across a lengthy stretch. But...take a look at the pictures. Do you or does anyone you know have a floor that varies by 2 inches at the exact same spot? Look at the curtains. Those are 2 curtain panels directly next to each other. Even the one that isn't too short is too long! The only reason we didn't box this crap up and send it back was because we had put too much work into getting it exactly right. So we took them all down, and tried putting the longer ones together, and the shorter ones together. Even the too-long ones weren't the same! Some were just barely 1/8th inch off the floor. Some actually were bunched up on the floor. That's how ""too long"" they were. Exact same thing with the too-short ones. It's like they have a different crew of weasels running the machines every day. We did the best we could, and used some furniture/plants to help hide the goofs. But we know they're there, and it's completely unacceptable, hidden by furniture or not. In fact it's so substandard Amazon should probably look at this company and their products, and consider whether this company is appropriate for a seller's spot on the Amazon platform.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Because voile is very delicate, my old curtains developed holes after many washings. Anyway, I guess I was a bit seduced by the description of these curtains as faux linen and voile like, and they were a decent price for long curtains. I purchased 3 packs of 2 each, and use only 1 per window. When I opened them I was sad to realize they are 100% polyester wirhout a trace if cotton or linen, and the fabric is not soft to the touch. However, the wrinkles from folding and packing were easy to iron out on the ""Poly"" setting of my iron, and the curtains are a soft white with a little texture to the fabric that appears to provide semi-sheerness while also letting in a good amount of diffused sunlight. Another reviewer said they tested to make sure that neighbors can't see in from the outside, so I'm going to trust that review as my nearest neighbors are well across the street. If I was not budgeting these days I would never have bought polyester curtains, but these work fine for now. As described by the seller, the hems are sewn very cleanly, the grommets are decent, and I only found a single stray piece of thread among the 6 curtains I purchased.",0,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": -1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Barraza,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022",1,I have had these curtains for about a month. I recently noticed a weird smell in the bedroom where these curtains were installed. I couldn't figure where the smell was coming from and never suspected that it would be the curtains. It turns out it was and these curtains came down immediately and I tossed them in the garbage. I don't know if I got some previously returned curtains that maybe somebody had spilled some nasty chemical on them or if its a factory defect...I don't know for sure. These windows are installed on a window that faces the sun in the afternoon so I don't know if its possibly a reaction of the material used with the heat of the sunrays. I really like these curtains but I couldn't tolerate the strange smell that they developed.

These curtains absolutely blackout the Texas sun which reduces the temperature in the garage by at least 10 degrees, if not more. Additionally, when i close the curtains, it’s completely private from the outside. I just ordered these for my bedroom windows to replace the 50% light filtering curtains I have to keep the lightning from freaking me and my dog out and to reduce the heat of the sun this summer, which will be our first summer in this home.

It seemed as though they were moderately thick, so I didn't really question that they were light blocking. My purpose for getting them was because they claimed to also be thermal and good for heat reduction. I can say that they are NOT thermal at all. I questioned whether they would be because there is no foam backing. I figured perhaps they were treated with something else. I'm not a drapes expert, so what do I know?! Today, the temperature is 84 for the first time this season. That is usually the golden number for heat coming into my apartment. The foam-backed curtains I had the last couple of years worked perfectly to reduce the heat. I should have stayed with that option. I put these up and I could feel the heat coming through immediately. It didn't even need any warm-up time!! I could also see light coming through, so these are definitely not good light-blocking drapes either. Once I got them up, they did reduce the light considerably, but not as good as my old thermal curtains. Because I can feel the heat coming thru the curtain, I know they will be a total fail when the temperature rises to 98 degrees. My advice to everyone is to stick with foam-backed thermal drapes and skip over these plain fabric ones who make false claims. I will likely reduce these to some other function in the house. They do make for nice drapes if all you need is just a window cover.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Color is still very pretty and we have several of the same brand and style blackout curtains in different sizes (and just the color black) for rooms all throughout our home, but we needed less contrasting colors for our living room and decided to try “stone blue” to match one of the living room walls. It came out more like a darkened turquoise and had more of green tints to it than pictured which was a bummer. Will likely be returning these ones, but will continue buying in black and possible other colors in the future! The black shade of them are flawless at blacking out any sun.

Out of the dryer they still had a slight wrinkle but not as bad as I was anticipating. I ironed them on low and they look fantastic. They are very soft to the touch and not super heavy. I would recommend and/or purchase again for other windows in my house. They block out the light considerably, so I'm pleased with them.

Very mild noise blocking also. Just wish they were a few inches longer.I live in a city and there is a traffic light (among other things) that shine into my window all night. I can see clear as day in my room with just the blinds in my apartment. Also, my windows are drafty AF. Because of the shape of my room, my only choice is to have my bed placed right up against the window.My roommates room is much larger so she doesn’t have these issues and we were having disagreements about the heat/AC. No matter what they were set to, my room was always too hot in the summer, and too cold in the winter.Not anymore!!! I am truly amazed by how well these keep my room getting cold! I can’t wait to see how they work in the summer also. I can sleep comfortably again the and the light and noise blocking (I live next to a train) is a huge bonus. Bonus too is that if I get a little hot at night I just have to open the curtains a tiny bit instead of opening my rusty windows lol.Only downside is that I wish these were a couple inches longer. In order to block the draft, I had to set up my tension rod pretty low, and the bottom of the window is JUST barely covered by the curtain, and there’s a gap at the top of the window, so some light does still pour through although it does still cancel a lot of light. The longer length wouldn’t have worked in my space since I’d have to “tuck” the curtain behind my bed which wouldn’t work as it’s right up against the window. Perhaps I should’ve ordered longer ones and hemmed them but oh well…",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

So I can't be an excellent judge of character on these curtains being the best in the way of ""blackout"" as their advertised and labeled and you can make evidence of by other photos and video from other customers.That said, they do an amazing job at what they do. They keep a substantial amount of light and heat at bay and I've already noticed a slight reduction in my electric bill thanks to putting these up.If you think I'm exaggerating on the electric bill, I'm not. My main living room is an open floor plan that includes a large double sliding glass door on either side of the room and on the living room side above. It is a equally large picture window as well as a full length window around the corner from the other sliding glass door. So while I fell in love with the space and the look, I did not fall in love with the fact that the son literally rises into my eyes and sets into my bedroom every evening. Did I mention I also have a third double sliding glass door in my bedroom upstairs? Yes, it's a little excessive at this point.Hence the need for these curtains. So far they've impressed me on their quality. From the second I opened the package based off of the price. I didn't know what to expect and I guess I just got lucky in that category with a great deal because these are premium quality fabric that are nicely tailored and have a semi-modern design blended into an ombre fade. I will say based off the seller photos I am very glad that I got the BLACK CURTAINS.Black is my favorite color and I have no problem with black curtains. However, considering the amount of windows I'm looking to cover, I didn't want it to be overpowering and these do a nice job of being dark while understated. The light can hit them just right that it's very illusory.I've included several photos which were very hard to take in the lighting that I have to work with even with the curtains fully drawn. But I hope you get the gist and I have no complaints about this purchase except I do wish I would have gotten a longer cut but that's just for my personal taste.Overall, this is an item I am happy to recommend to anyone looking to add a little style and shade to your favorite space.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

No they are not blackout like everyone is complaining. But they do drop the light in the room an enormous percentage. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day outside when I hung them. But in the video you can see how bright it is in my apartment with the windows bare and with the drapes pulled – no blinds. Major diff.One thing that I was a bit upset about when I took it out of the package, The entire bag was completely soaked. Not the shipping bag but the inside clear bag. Like the curtains were completely wet and left out in the rain and then packed up. Not one dry spot.You can see some of the rust from the zipper that stained the curtains. I don't know who was at fault for that, But it was a bit upsetting hence the four stars. Otherwise the color of the blinds and everything else were amazing.

These curtains did a great job at helping block out light and helping to keep the temperature lower inside during the summer. I haven’t had these during winter yet, so I’m not sure about how they will do with keeping the heat inside. The color is nice and the texture is soft and silky. They only had one horizontal wrinkle from how they were packaged. They are fairly heavy and thick so they don’t wrinkle easy. I took a video to show how sheer they are.

The material is very good at completely blocking any light from passing through, which can be extremely helpful for late sleepers because our guest room window faces the morning sun.  - The thickness of the curtains provides some insulating factor both in the winter and in the summer.  These keep the cold drafts next to the window and out of the room in the winter.  On warmer days, the heat from the sun cannot be felt when the curtains are closed.  - These thick curtains muffle sound from the window area.  The normal outside noises are lessened by the weight of these curtains further upping their effectiveness at helping to create a great sleeping environment.  - The curtains look great and feel like they cost quite a bit more.  These curtains are a great value in addition to looking great.CONS:  - This isn't necessarily a negative about the curtains, but the sheer weight of the curtains forced me to put up a better curtain rod that is secured to wall studs.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 1, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

That's why I decided to try the JEETEE Pots and Pans Set, a 26-piece collection with a detachable handle for space-saving storage. Here's what my experience has been like:Stackable Smarts: The detachable handle is the real star of this set. It allows you to remove the handle from the pots and pans, making them incredibly stackable. This is a game-changer for small kitchens or anyone who wants to maximize cabinet space.Stovetop Versatility: The set is advertised to work on various stovetops, including gas, electric, and induction. This versatility is a major plus, meaning you won't have to worry about compatibility issues no matter what kind of stove you have.Oven-Safe Options: Several pieces in the set, including the saucepans and the casserole dish, are oven-safe up to 350°F. This allows you to seamlessly transition from stovetop cooking to baking or finishing a dish in the oven, all within the same pan.Non-Stick Appeal: The pans feature a non-stick coating, which makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. Food slides right off, minimizing the need for excess oil and making post-meal cleanup a snap.A Word on Size: The online description didn't mention the specific sizes of each pot and pan. While it seems like a comprehensive set, knowing the sizes beforehand would be helpful to ensure you're getting the pieces you'll use most often.A Peek at Quality: While the set seems well-made overall, some user reviews mentioned concerns about the long-term durability of the non-stick coating and the handles. Reading a wider range of reviews might be helpful before you buy.Overall: The JEETEE Pots and Pans Set (26 pcs) offers a space-saving design with its detachable handle and a good variety of pieces for everyday cooking. The non-stick coating and oven-safe functionality add to its convenience. However, the lack of size information and some questions about long-term quality are worth considering. If you have limited cabinet space and prioritize space-saving features, this set could be a good option, but reading more reviews might be helpful to get a better sense of its durability.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

This is a great set of nonstick pans and includes all of the silicone utensils. The removable handles make them easy to put in smaller ovens and into dishwashers without the handles getting in the way. As you can see in the short video I attached they are really easy to clean. I just gently wiped with a dry paper towel. They heat very evenly. These are a great size for a smaller family that doesn't need large pots and pans. I really love these! They are versatile, easy to clean and take up very little space",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

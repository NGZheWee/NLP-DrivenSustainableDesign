A bit overpriced for what they are, but every shop seemed to be out of stock on the island. Coffee must be had, thus they were ordered.Good quality.

Do not leak  !!! Recommend !

Brilliant for use with a single cup filter paper holder.

Unlike the other filter type, this one works flawlessly. I can make a full pot of coffee without any danger of an overflow.  Don't waste your money on anything else.

Double pack offer is good and filters work fine in my machine.

They work as always. Nothing special.

To make coffee the best way.

Excellent highly recommend

Ok

Do their usual good job

The box is crushed and unsanitary

The product quality is good. The box was delivered crushed, but the filters inside are fine. Amazon says this is a 2-Cup filter paper. However, the size is too big even for my 4 cup coffee maker. The 1X2 coffee filter fits it correctly. I have been buying 102 size for some time. Sometimes Amazon sends 1X2 size for 2-cup coffee filter, and this size is correct. But this time they sent 102 size, and this is too big.

I don't like this item not because of the quality but because of the design of this whole filtering method. Although it is for 2 cups, I would still suggest that you pour water into it several times. Why? It's just the speed that water flows through is not even. If you pour 2 cups of water inside all at once, you'll surely get coffee that is too watery, because the water flows through very very quickly. Yet when the water reaches the bottom, it flows too slowly. I have to honestly say that this design is not as smart as the Japanese drip bags made of paper. It costs an extra ceramic cup, is clumsy, but doesn't do the job perfectly.

After buying I realized the price was the same as in any random supermarket. Still ok.

Box was damaged when we got but still the filters were good.

Fits our 4-cup Phillips perfectly, don't have to trim the paper to size, and no overflow of powder.  The other brand we usually buy is a bit too large, and we have to snip off an inch off of the top of the filter.  But this is 25% more expensive than the other one.  Won't hesitate to buy again whenever the other one is not available.

Good

The product is the same as shown in the picture.

Package is delivered with damaged as photos while product is fine. This is a area to be improved as it is important to keep clean as it is not a washable product.

OK

They're not cheap - but to give them credit they don't fall apart and make good coffee.

Ok

The papers are of good quality, with a natural brown color, and they are free from any chemical residue. The size is perfect, and the brand name is well-regarded. Overall, everything seems great—these are awesome papers and definitely worth it.

Pricy but good quality

Useful

I have been buying these coffee filters for years and they have always been top quality.

I actually bought the wrong size but it turns out their smaller length means there is no danger of the top folding over. When the top falls  down it weakens the coffee.  I will continue to use them.

Glad it’s available on Amazon. Used to get it from Germany earlier. My machine is big but I use 1*2 as I don’t need more than two cups at a time. It has never folded or torn in my experience. Great product.

Perfect fit

Fits perfectly on my 12-cup coffee maker. Quality is fine, made in Germany, worth the money

Delivered quickly and item as described at a fair price. Will buy again

Great filters allow the release of the great aroma of my coffee and very easy to use.I use recently roasted beans ground at leve 8 on my grinder.I also use chemex which is great too and was my favourite quality up to now, but this matches it and I fully recommend it.

I use these on my small pour-over also from Melitta as well as in my small coffee maker. These work great, although I've had one or two of them split when they get wet. For the price there's nothing really to complain about and they do a flawless job of filtering the coffee.

Perfect size for my Philips senseo pod and cone filter machine as 102 or 3 is correct size. Good construction and design . Size 4 paper filters also fit this machine if bottom fold tucked in

I have a Melitta coffee machine which take these 102 filters. Not very available in UK shops, but easy to get on amazon! Just what I need!

Ideal way to make single cup of coffee (with the holder of course) have tried various cup and cafeterias and most are flawed in some way.  Just a simple filter and get excellent results everytime

The original aroma and test is kept with this filter.

Good value for the money. I like that it is not bleached paper.

Good fit for one cup drip. Same size as number 2 filter.

t hese are just perfect for my new melitta coffee machine and eco friendly.will stick with these.

This must be a joke.  The SMALLEST filters I have every seen showed up at my door - the pack is the size of a pack of playing cards.  I started laughing outloud 0-I have bought the exact same filters with the same labelling online and they bring you the ones that fit in an actual coffee machine or carafe. These seem to be about 1/2 the size of a 1 cup personal drip, not even big enough for that.  Not worth returning, but BE WARNED PLEASE.

I didn't see the size listed anywhere for these, I didn't even know that anyone made coffee filters this small. its like they were designed for mice

This product is not the same as showcased in the picture with the coffee machine. I have the exact same machine at home and they dont even reach half way to the top. Extremely small coffee filters.

These were tiny. Very annoyed about the waste of time and money. The size should be made far clearer. Even going back now, only the comments give any clue...and why would you read the reviews for a product you think you already know.

LORT Count of the number times we had to rinse the filters with boiled water before any papery flavor and taste were gone. Usually with white paper filters it's only a couple of times.Unfortunately,  they've now added these aroma pur holes which let in cafestol & kahweol coffee oils.The whole point of choosing the paper filter method is to filter out this gunk these compounds. They might add extra flavor they might add a fraction of extra fiber for some people, but these harmful coffee oils Skyrocket your blood pressure and upset your insides. Stick with the bleached filters

Not what I thought i was ordering.These filters are a mini version of the normal size filters which i was expecting. No good for my machine.

Unusable

Too small to be of any use.

These are great if you have a doll house sized coffee machine but are too small for a normal sized one.  More expensive then the normal sized ones too. I had to re-order.

It’s very small useless for my machine yet bought via buy again link on Amazon. Will not buy this product on Amazon again

Bought these as the 1x2 is no longer available and the photo showed someone using it in a drip filter. Fills basically half the ceramic drip, basically just enough for the coffee grinds. Genuinely don’t know what anyone could use these for

According to Melitta's website this is the next size down from 1 x 4 , there being no 1 x 2 any more. Which is why elsewhere the prices for the 1 x 2 have increased.This thing belongs to a dolly's coffee set rather than used in a 1 x 2 filter holder.

Amazon to blame for this one - I searched for size 4 filter papers and this came up as the 1st option, so I didn't really bother to check the sizes properly.They are NOT size 4 filters! They're tiny. It's also not really made clear anywhere in the description.Waste of time and money unless you have a machine that takes these tiny papers!

Don't be fooled by the big coffee machine picture in the third picture. Just small, cup-sized paper strainers.

They are VERY small, no use for my filter machine unfortunately.

The description of the product is very bad. There is no size and the it did not work for n my coffee maker.

This is the third time I give a chance and at least 30% is the filters come with a hole

not what i expected...these are tiny filters

I've been using the Melitta Coffee Filters 100/40 Natural Brown for a few weeks now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with their performance. One of the standout features is how they fit perfectly in my coffee maker, ensuring a smooth brewing process every time.

These are very tiny. I have a one cup coffee flask with a tiny conical sieve, my other filters seemed to big for it so I ordered these. However it's very hard to pour the boiling water in without the tiny filter overflowing, so you have to pour very slowly, in stages... a bit tedious and you end up with lukewarm coffee! So... back to the bigger filters for me because the sides are higher and so they hold the coffee better and let you pour faster.

I hadn't realised when I ordered them how small they were.  Nothing wrong with the quality but very tiny.

Good filters, but small. Ordered for a MoccaMaster Cup One, that's a Nr. 1 filter machine. It works, but very little room for errors. The Technivorm (Original MoccaMaster) Nr. 1 filters are a little bit bigger.

Because item is Melitta product, I gave it 4 star. Item was too small for me but quality is still there.

Perfect for the Aromaboy! I only wish there were more in the box to make the packaging and shipping more worthwhile.Do exactly what you expect

A sample pack of five should be included with purchase of new coffee maker!

Do the job they are meant to do

Great value working very well.

ok

The media could not be loaded.
                



Perfect for the aromaboy, as the video shows, some people say it is a little too small, but the tolerance is less at smaller scale. If you grind too finely the water level will rise!

100% positive

quick service very good filters

Mini filter

Does the trick really, it's a good size for what I need for.Good value for money.

I purchased a few of these in 2020 - and loved them. Wanted more for my garden, they have changed the product slightly and the quality has gone down.  One arrived broken, the magnet which completes the circuit had broken off...and the other magnet wasn't strong enough to stay "down" to keep the light on.  Sad, because I have sent this product to so many friends to buy and now wouldn't recommend it. :(

I bought this for my wife, she liked it but never really used it until she brought it out recently for the holidays and it had stopped working.  Doesn't hold a charge or light at all.

I bought this to support the program but the product is pretty worthless. Lasted a couple weeks. Might as well just send a check if you want to support their work. The light just doesn’t work.

Mine does not work. The light does not come on. I tried several places in the yard thinking maybe it wasn’t getting enough light. By the time I determined it was not working the return window had closed and the option to contact vendor no longer appeared.

Does not hold a charge. Jar only lights turns on for a few second before turning off. Also tried charging via micro USB to no avail. Will be returning for refund.

Don't stay lit.

It doesn’t work... it was very sunny sat and sunday but the light does not stay on - it doesn’t turn on Automatically i have to lift up and down the dot to turn on then it stays on for 2 min then the light turn off- it was pretty expensive and i dt want to find a box ( cause i destroyed the box ) then go to the post office- could u help thanks

... however the lamp only worked for two nights. Although it stood on my windowsill all day to load.I found the micro USB to be badly designed. When plugged it the lamp shines. However with the cable attached you can't put it on the glass. What is the use of it than?

Update (Oct 2019): I had bought one for myself and one for my fiance, within about 1.5 years for mine and 1yr for hers they quit taking a charge and quit lighting.  They were cool while they lasted, but way to expensive for the short life and little use they got.  :-/It’s a nice jar light, prob the best I’ve had, just wish the battery were replaceable when it fails.

These looked nice until they stopped working.I bought 6 of them but now only 3 work.Even though I had the lids screwed on tight condensation got into the jars and damaged them.They were expensive so I thought they'd last longer.

Bought this and when using the light it goes out rather quickly. Maybe an hour but not more. Poor investment on my part

Great initially (first 2 weeks) but now it will not charge or emit light, despite being in full sunlight all day. I was really excited about this but it has really disappointed me. I perhaps have a defective one due to all the excellent reviews, but my experience with it has been very poor.

This is very cute but its way to much money for a quart size bottle with lights in it.

It's a nice light that is good for balconies that don't have outlets outside.  The only thing that I don't like, the brightness of the light isn't strong enough to be able read or do paperwork on the table in the evenings.  It's more like it's good for a candle light dinner mode.

This lamp was absolutely awesome. We try to reduce artificial light and this little handy gadget worked well for reading with the kids or walking to the loo late. It is beautifully made and super practical. Sadly it stopped working after only two months. Maybe we were just unlucky, but we would have absolutely loved to use it way longer.

This was my Mother’s Day present. I have not had to turn it on very often since I received it and when I did I just used it less than 5 minutes. It has continually been on the patio in direct sun daily since May.  Tropical Storm Gordon prompted me to use it. It stayed on for less than a minute. However, I emailed the company and within an hour I had a reply that they would replace the light.  AWESOME CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM SONNRNGLAS!

Of the three lamps I purchased two of them are working fine.  The third lamp has a defect in that the lid with the electronics is filled with water and won't work now.  For the price of these items, something in the design needs to change.  Perhaps this lamp is defective.  I am sincerely disappointed.

Wonderful idea.  Charging for a day in good sun gives many evenings of light.  Main complaint is that the LED lights are a very cool, blue color and don't feel relaxing like a warm light would.

I love the product. However the sub port on the inside is very difficult to access.

I do like this solar lamp; it's a very simple design that looks good in a minimalist setting in the house or garden. It can also be filled with an array of objects (stones; shells, coloured glass beads etc.) to match your decor if desired.The on/off mechanism is ingenious (a magnet flips over onto the lid, rather than a normal switch or button) and the electronics are small and neatly concealed under the lid. When unscrewing the lid, the 'works' do seem rather exposed and a little loose - time will tell if this is a problem - but the lid only needs to be removed regularly if you wish to charge the light using a USB connection.The light itself is quite bright; much brighter than similar lights I'd seen previously. It's a fairly neutral light, too, not too blue or too orange, just a warmish white. I don't think this is a light to take travelling (it's too bulky and possibly fragile) but for the garden or home, it's a nice object and useful source of illumination. It's also good to know that it is a Fair Trade product made in South Africa and benefiting local communities, although the instructions were provided - rather unhelpfully - in German.Would I recommend it? Well, not at the £26 it was previously listed at, but the current price of £17 (July 2017) it is probably fairly priced and I would recommend it as a gift for an eco-minded friend, or a treat for yourself.NB I received this product free of charge in return for completing a product testing questionnaire. This review is, however, my honest opinion of the product.

I like that it's nice and bright and unlike most things nowadays it's not made in China but you need to switch it on unlike a lot of other solar products that turn on automatically when it gets dark still though good lantern

The product has a very simple, minimal design, which I really like. It basically looks as though you've bought an empty jar, but the light produced has a nice soft effect. The jar is very simple to use, with a simple hinge to place the battery onto the circuit, and a solar panel on the top of the lid of the jar. The instructions were in German, but that did not really matter. There is a micro-USB on the bottom of the circuit board under the lid, which allows you to charge the power as well. I have only had the product for a day, so I have not let the charge run down and recharged it yet, but the connection seems good. Unfortunately there is no light or other indicator to tell you that the battery is charging.The product does not look particularly hard-wearing and the circuit is a little too exposed, but it does have a nice handmade feel to it.

I really like the look of this product. The craftsmanship isn't bad at all, and I love the fact that this product is so "green". Has a nice weight to it but doesn't feel too heavy to carry in your hand. The light is customizable in the sense that putting reflective objects inside the glass will product varying colors and effects. I can totally see people buying multiple lights and decorating gardens and rooms, etc. It's a simple, but nice looking product.I give it 5 stars because they describe it exactly as it is in their advertisement. Yes, the light isn't quite bright enough to replace your lightstand light, but I feel like that's obvious from the product video so I won't detract anything from this rating.

These are every bit as good as they are presented here. Nice twinkling light. Good, thick glass. Cool that you can fill them up with stuff. Really a great product!

I had never heard of Sonnenglas until I visited my brother-in-law and sister-in-law's home. They had placed 4 Sonnenglas lights on an outdoor table where they dine at night. Each jar had different items inside including pine cones, seagrass and shells. I was so taken with them that I couldn't stop thinking about them. Unfortunately at the time , they were out of stock online. I kept looking and 3 months later I was able to buy one on Amazon. I put small paper stars in mine. It makes me smile every time I turn its light on.

I first discovered these lanterns on a trip to So. Africa.  They are great for outdoor decor, but I have also used them during power outages.  My first four are over 6 years old and still going strong.

This is the third Sonnenglas solar light we've ordered.  We have a small cabin  in the woods off the grid. Lighting is an ongoing problem.  Battery lights, if you hang them, have no down-light; and just when you need them, the batteries have gone dead.  Kerosene and gas lamps represent a fire hazard when children are around.  These solar lights are perfect.  They shine more downlight than one might think; they are very well engineered and made.  We will buy more over time.  We've tried others with a similar concept - they don't hold a charge, and the on-off mechanism seems to never work.  Love the Sonnenglas - you will too.

expensive but they last forever

This is my 2nd solar lantern and I just love them! I was so happy to find it available on Amazon! My first one, I had for so many years, that it was finally time to replace it. The customer service on this product is amazing! I worked with an amazing person "Simone" and my questions were always answered in such a kind, caring and efficient manner! Thank you, Simone!

These are the BEST.  One stopped working after a few weeks and they sent me a new one, no problem.  My other jars from them have lasted over two years and still going strong.

These are fantastic!  I first bought 4 of them a few years back while travelling in South Africa. Beautiful & creative solar powered mason-jar lanterns. They're great for the deck/patio, and inside as well & always get compliments from friends.  I was so thrilled to find them available via Amazon now when I needed more to spread around!  They arrived in perfect shape and on time, have improved design with a micro-USB port inside for charging when the sun isnt shining.  On top of all this, they're made by a local community economic devt project in South Africa, helping out with jobs and skills.  We filled ours with white shells from the beach which makes the light even more brilliant.  Highly recommended !!

I bought this to add some ambiance to a room we recently redecorated. My wife loves it. She took it with her on a recent retreat and picked up pine cones to put in it. I like the ability to charge with the sun OR with a USB charger which will make it continuously usable during our cloudy winters. It's also heart-warming to know that in a small way, this purchase is doing some good. The video of the manufacturing process was an influence in my purchase decision.

The Solar Jar is a high quality product you can feel good about buying and using. I now have a couple of them which I use to liven up our indoor/outdoor space. The jars couldn't be easier to use with the simple magnet attachments. The handle also lets you hang these overhead to make them a little bit more of a focus wherever you are using them. Best of all, I can use it at will knowing it's not wasting any energy or hurting the environment!Highly recommend the Solar Jar if you're looking for a fun new twist on lighting up your spaces.

Best product I have ever purchased. They are absolutely stunning.So an update on this product. DISAPPOINTEDI have to reset the magnet on the top to make them come on every night. I expected them, being solar, to come on a dusk, and go off at daylight. Well they go off all right, an hour after I reset the magnet on the top of EVERY light. They are absolutely stunning, when they are lit.

Used outdoors. Was ready to use immediately upon arrival. After solar charging, lasted as expected.

Love this lantern. It looks great, is solid, and love how you just make a small connection to light it. This is solid, not cheap like some unknown solar lights. Got as a gift and am buying some to give as gifts, they are that cool

I have 4 of these. I first saw them while on safari in Uganda. Our meals outside where made even more delightful by there warmth. Put flowers on the bottom and your table with be beautiful!

I originally saw this lamp at a restaurant in Ireland and loved it. Came home and purchased two for myself. Use them for outdoor dining at my cabin, filling jar with pine cones and tree moss. Guests love them and I have since purchased 5 more as hostess gifts.

These are great. If you have a porch area or plan on sitting outside in warm weather, these keep the area very well lit. We ordered 7 and had an issue with one. Fortunately, we can charge it via USB and it works well.

I gave one of these lanterns to friend for Christmas.  Maybe one of the most unique and fascinating gifts I've ever given! I love that they are actually bright enough to read by, and the decorating possibilities are endless!  I'm not going to wait to drop hints to my family...I'm going to start collecting these for myself!!

We will continue to gift these to our friends

I love this lantern! I’ve had it now for three years. We use it for parties, camping, and when the power goes out. It is beautiful, it is simple, and it lasts an incredibly long time on.

I saw these light in South Africa a few weeks ago and was blown away by the product, the story about how Sonnenglas was created. Our new lights are fantastic! I love how your product is changing lives. I can only hope Sonnenglas lights continue to improve the lives of so many people, all over the world.

Saw these on Instagram and I loved them! They are pretty bright after they get a good amount of sunshine. I use these throughout my house instead of nightlights. Love the glow!

I love these glass solar lights and use them in my backyard, camping and have given them to my son to use in his trailer!

Been using for a month and works great.  Just wish the USB was outside so we didn't need to unscrew to use.  But its been working great and a nice addition.

Very cute. Nice larger size . Like it so much keep in house so won't break accidentally. Keep it charged using USB port. Used when list electricity during storm.

I HAVE 2 OF THESE AND HAVE GIFTED 5 OTHERS. SOME FROM AMAZON AND SEVERAL FROMSONNEGLASS

The light they cast is beautiful. They solve a problem that would otherwise have required a lot of outdoor electrical work. And, seeing how well they work, I would have chosen them over the electrical alternative even if the wiring weren't an issue.

These look great and last a long time. Great conversation piece. I turn my lamp on in the bathroom with an odd item inside it when I have people over.

First saw them in the Turks and Caicos Island and had to have them.  They work great.  Charge even if not in full sunlight and give great light for a long time.

We first saw these while on a safari in Botswana and were enchanted.  When we got back I ordered one. it is amazing.  It has lasted through storms and freezing conditions.  It has become my favorite housewarming gift.

I love this product so much. It gives me so peaceful time every night.

Bright light, lasts a long time, and I like the flexibility to put anything in the jar to change the appearance.

Great when the lites go out to find you way around

Such a nice bright lantern. Gave as gifts to my daughters with a special note inside for them to fond when they use it.

Travel with this in the camper and just a great night light.

It's so bright!!  Love the magnetic control and the option to decorate inside the jar.  First day/night using it,  but love it already!

This is the perfect gift for those who enjoy sitting in their backyard on a warm summer night.

I really love the quality of these. Yes there are cheaper ones out there but these are really nice.

Great product, really neat how it works, and a very nice light for an outdoor patio party!

These are he best on the market! Although pricey I can assure you that they are worth it. Everyone whose seen ours have bought their own

A superior solar light. The on/off function is great. Bought a second one for a gift.

Safer than a candle..I especially love being able to turn them on and off.The light is not too dim but just right to light your way or your gathering.

my family has not had their power restoted in almost six months due to a hurricane. This somar lamo has been a life saver!!

Gives great light, always at the ready and so happy to support a fantastic company providing much needed jobs to people who are proud to work for this company.

Excellent quality product. Charged easily and projected nice quality lighting. Enjoyed decorating the base of the jar to match where it is displayed.

Great product- there are a lot of spin off's but you won't be as satisfied as you would be if you had purchased this light.

This is a great product!  Smart use of technology  Gives off a very nice lite, lasts for hours.

It's a fun light for your balcony, patio, etc. and is renewed by the sun.

These lights are very cool. They really create an intimate atmosphere.

we think these are  usual and very clever. not make in china

Exactly what I need and happy with this product, especially for small dirty shoes, air holes good

Love this basket very neat looking and fits nice in my kitchen cabinet, I have two now and may get somemore, it’s also very solid.

Lovely, nice and big

Ok

Good size for bedroom bathroom or office

Lightweight and good workmanship

It's fine. Can't say much more about a bin. It's beyond me why they all cost so much when it's just plastic - worth about £1 like a bucket, but inexplicably call it a bin and you can charge at least 10x that apparently.

I ordered 3 of these bins for use in my home office. I am very happy with the quality of the product. They are a good size, so I don`t have to empty them every day. They are sturdy and easy to clean. Very good value.

There's not much one can really say about a waste bin apart from it does the job intended for and it looks nice in a living room.

It's a small bin that does the job

Exactly what I was looking for

It will look great in my room

Light and looks good

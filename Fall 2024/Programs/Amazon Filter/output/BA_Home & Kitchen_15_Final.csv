Although it is for 2 cups, I would still suggest that you pour water into it several times. Why? It's just the speed that water flows through is not even. If you pour 2 cups of water inside all at once, you'll surely get coffee that is too watery, because the water flows through very very quickly. Yet when the water reaches the bottom, it flows too slowly. I have to honestly say that this design is not as smart as the Japanese drip bags made of paper.

I purchased a few of these in 2020 - and loved them. Wanted more for my garden, they have changed the product slightly and the quality has gone down.  One arrived broken, the magnet which completes the circuit had broken off...and the other magnet wasn't strong enough to stay ""down"" to keep the light on.  Sad, because I have sent this product to so many friends to buy and now wouldn't recommend it. :(",-2,-2

It can also be filled with an array of objects (stones; shells, coloured glass beads etc.) to match your decor if desired.The on/off mechanism is ingenious (a magnet flips over onto the lid, rather than a normal switch or button) and the electronics are small and neatly concealed under the lid. When unscrewing the lid, the 'works' do seem rather exposed and a little loose - time will tell if this is a problem - but the lid only needs to be removed regularly if you wish to charge the light using a USB connection.The light itself is quite bright; much brighter than similar lights I'd seen previously. It's a fairly neutral light, too, not too blue or too orange, just a warmish white. I don't think this is a light to take travelling (it's too bulky and possibly fragile) but for the garden or home, it's a nice object and useful source of illumination. It's also good to know that it is a Fair Trade product made in South Africa and benefiting local communities, although the instructions were provided - rather unhelpfully - in German.Would I recommend it? Well, not at the £26 it was previously listed at, but the current price of £17 (July 2017) it is probably fairly priced and I would recommend it as a gift for an eco-minded friend, or a treat for yourself.NB I received this product free of charge in return for completing a product testing questionnaire. This review is, however, my honest opinion of the product.",1,1

It basically looks as though you've bought an empty jar, but the light produced has a nice soft effect. The jar is very simple to use, with a simple hinge to place the battery onto the circuit, and a solar panel on the top of the lid of the jar. The instructions were in German, but that did not really matter. There is a micro-USB on the bottom of the circuit board under the lid, which allows you to charge the power as well. I have only had the product for a day, so I have not let the charge run down and recharged it yet, but the connection seems good. Unfortunately there is no light or other indicator to tell you that the battery is charging.The product does not look particularly hard-wearing and the circuit is a little too exposed, but it does have a nice handmade feel to it.",1,1

We have a small cabin  in the woods off the grid. Lighting is an ongoing problem.  Battery lights, if you hang them, have no down-light; and just when you need them, the batteries have gone dead.  Kerosene and gas lamps represent a fire hazard when children are around.  These solar lights are perfect.  They shine more downlight than one might think; they are very well engineered and made.  We will buy more over time.  We've tried others with a similar concept - they don't hold a charge, and the on-off mechanism seems to never work.  Love the Sonnenglas - you will too.",2,2

It can also be filled with an array of objects (stones; shells, coloured glass beads etc.) to match your decor if desired.The on/off mechanism is ingenious (a magnet flips over onto the lid, rather than a normal switch or button) and the electronics are small and neatly concealed under the lid. When unscrewing the lid, the 'works' do seem rather exposed and a little loose - time will tell if this is a problem - but the lid only needs to be removed regularly if you wish to charge the light using a USB connection.The light itself is quite bright; much brighter than similar lights I'd seen previously. It's a fairly neutral light, too, not too blue or too orange, just a warmish white. I don't think this is a light to take travelling (it's too bulky and possibly fragile) but for the garden or home, it's a nice object and useful source of illumination. It's also good to know that it is a Fair Trade product made in South Africa and benefiting local communities, although the instructions were provided - rather unhelpfully - in German.Would I recommend it? Well, not at the Â£26 it was previously listed at, but the current price of Â£17 (July 2017) it is probably fairly priced and I would recommend it as a gift for an eco-minded friend, or a treat for yourself.NB I received this product free of charge in return for completing a product testing questionnaire.

It is an HP printer and I've had it for about 6 months. Suddenly the first time I use HP's own paper, it prints one page really poorly, and then completely quits working. A head cleaning did nothing but waste colored ink. The black cartridge that was 60% full is now useless.Furthermore, the packaging is worthless. As someone who prints 1-4 pages/mo, I obviously can't fit the entire 500 page ream in my printer. My expectation is to keep most of it in the packaging to prevent damage. Instead, within seconds of opening this package the entire thing split down the side and spilled all over the floor.I am of the personal opinion that corporate giants like HP do things like this intentionally to force users to waste product and have to buy more sooner. Whether that is true is debatable, but I see far too many gimmicks that point to this kind of behavior from companies like HP.

I ordered a while back but did not need to start using it until recently and unfortunately didn't pay attention to what the boxes said. What I received was not HP; it was Boise X9 paper from Boise White Paper LLC. The paper isn't even close to ultra white, and even though it says it's 20#, the texture of it is such that my Brother office printer/copier pulls through multiple sheets at a time. I have wasted a lot of paper because it's printing on the edges of multiple sheets, which then can't be reused. I have to print my documents all over again because they're not printing fully on one page. Even when the print job prints cleanly, it still pulls through extra sheets, which also means my tray is emptying much faster than it should be. In a nutshell, I'm wasting both time and money. I went away from Office Depot because of some customer service issues, but I may have to go back to them because the paper I used to get from them was at least good quality!

These towels were supposed to be for my two sons to take to their dorms, but the last thing my boys wanted was a hand towel box decorated with bright pink roses in the shape of hearts. And the design isn't my taste either, so I emptied out an old box and filled it with the new towels and threw the bizarre box away.  And I cancelled the auto ordering for this product. Don't want to buy more until this lame design is phased out. So I want to Target to some, and guess what--a shelf full of the Betsi Johnson designed boxes on clearance and no normal boxes.

I agree with others that the new gaudy boxes in the mix are a big L. On the other hand, paper companies have been foisting hideous Kleenex boxes on us for decades and we put up with that, so... meh. I can live with a box designed by--I'm guessing--some crazy scrapbook lady. I've seen worse. Those original embossed boxes were the classiest ever, though, man! Like a little minimalist sculpture on the countertop! Bring those back, K-C!*-*-*-*-There must be a bestselling business book in this mystery: why do so many companies, of all sizes, feel compelled to ""fix"" products that are perfect, wrecking them in the process? I find it hard to believe that I am the only consumer who would rather just pay more to get the same quality if there have been increases in material or other costs that affect the company's bottom line. Especially when we are talking about a product that is positioned as a superior, premium product in the first place.Kleenex Hand Towels are the latest victim. I've used them since they came on the market, I always paid a premium for them and I would pay a higher premium to keep the unique level of quality. No such luck.Some time earlier this year they redid the box. That was a bummer because those old embossed boxes were really swell, but that's a minor thing. The change to the towels (Generation 2) themselves at that point was pretty subtle. Not as sturdy and thick, not as much a quality feel. I didn't like it as much, but I could live with it.My most recent Subscribe and Save batch that I just cracked open is a big step down even from that first change. The towels (Generation 3) feel and look even thinner, grayer and rougher, but the big problem is the new chemical smell. Since I use these on my face, that is extremely noticeable. I have some left of the original type (Generation 1) and the type from earlier this year (Gen 2) and I compared them. I can pick out the brand new ones (Gen 3) with my eyes closed because of the strong smell. The box, SKU, etc are identical to Gen 2.I'm actually going to send these back to Amazon, although I feel bad because it's not their fault. Since Amazon is one of the few companies in America that seems to understand giving customers what they want, I am hoping that if they have to eat some returns,  they will in turn crack some skulls over at Kimberly-Clark. So I encourage those of you who agree with me to do returns as well. I am going to call the Kleenex customer service number, but we all know that won't do any good. (""In order to serve you better, we have reformulated our product. Our extensive market research shows that consumers love the new feel of Kleenex Hand Towels. Thank you for contacting us."")

However, the number of towels in a box and the length and width of the towels is the same as the old.  So how can they fit them in the smaller box?  I think they are packed a little tighter, but somehow they are not as thick as the old ones.  I say ""somehow"" because when I first pulled a new towel out it felt lighter, softer, and thinner than the old ones.  But when I compared them side by side, to my surprise the difference was much less...the older ones just seemed rougher to the touch but not necessarily heavier.I decided to do a strength test.  I grabbed an OLD towel in both hands in front of me (like grasping a steering wheel) and sharply and quickly stretched the towel. 3-4 times it was solid and didn't rip.  Then I tried the same test with the NEW towel.  On the second stretch both sides ripped!  I repeated the test with two more towels from the old and new, and the same result.So yes, somehow the new towels are softer and more importantly less durable.  However, I still find them acceptable for their purpose and have not had any problems with them ripping when trying to pull them from the box.  After all, it's a paper towel - don't treat it like a sheet of Kevlar.  All that being said, just like any paper towel you will still be using 2 in order to completely dry your hands.And note to Kleenex:  Yes, apparently we DID notice that tiny change you made to save a few pennies...Why do people insist on fixing things that aren't broken?",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Quality Control issues! The box containing the individual boxes is crushed in with a very particular pattern completely around the box. The Kleenex are still usable but it is sad that quality control is really suffering regarding the packaging and the individual boxes are not tearing at the perforations without ripping the plastic off with it. I can tell the package issue is NOT from Amazon transporting them. It's obvious by other observations that the boxes are taped AFTER being crushed in. The taping is not creased or shows no sign of having been distorted. Also Amazon obviously doesn't package the individual boxes within. I only noticed QC issues after about 2 months into the COVID lockdowns. So I firmly believe that Quality Control has become a low priority for Kleenex Corporation. The inner boxes are damaged when the outer box is crushed while being packaged in the outer box at the factory.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": -1, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

They are soft but sturdy, easy to use, convenient, and most of all, SANITARY!! As the mother of 5 kids, I was always bothered by how dirty our hand towels were, those were dirt and germs being spread through my family, I was always washing hand towels(like daily), and I knew there had to be a better solution.I tried washcloths that would be used once then washed, however, you have NO IDEA how much laundry this makes in a 7person household, nor did even I have any idea how many washcloths needed to be purchased to make this a viable option. The 80 that I purchased just didnt cut it, I needed about 4-5 times that...this also requires keeping a ""nice set"" for company separate from the family use towels.I found a coupon for these hand towels on s&s and decided to give them a try, if I didnt like them as hand towels, I could use them for papertowels. They are perfect hand towels!! They keep everything sanitary, are soft enough to use on faces(even baby faces), and the dispenser is nice for setting on a towel rack(which is also my only complaint). I can fit 2 side by side on my bath towel rack(and have a decorative towel on my hand towel ring).These hold up well wet and dry, my 3yr old uses them to cover her eyes when washing her hair and then proceeds to use it as a washcloth, it does well. I have also grabbed them to clean bathroom messes, again, they hold up to multiple rinsings and ringings and scrubbings.I am removing a star for 2 reasons.1)the dispenser, while fitting on my towel rack, is a bit top heavy and has a tendency to topple down. I do have a narrow towel bar to wall opening, so maybe others wont have this issue.2)I wish they made a refillable dispenser, throwing away 6-8 boxes each month just seems like such a waste(yes, I know this is a small issue compared with all the towels being thrown away and yes it is all recyclable(towels and box), but still).The negatives are a fine trade off in comparison to the sanitation issues I was facing in a household of children(no matter how many times we do handwashing training, they just dont get it...but it does eventually sink in, my 14yr old is an expert hand washer now ;-))So, if you are looking for a great, recyclable, sanitary hand towel, look no further...but be aware that you will likely have the cleanest bathroom in the neighborhood as you wont be able to resist drying you hands and proceeding to wipe up the sink, mirror, door handle, etc :-)",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 1, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I loved the box design and it was a perfect fit for between the medicine cabinet and a shelf I have up in there and because I liked the way the white looked against the chocolate walls I removed the towels and stapled the box to the wall and replaced the towels (I tried heavy duty tape at first but it was always leaning off the wall) and I use light tape to keep the top closed. The great thing is when I want to change the box color it's easy to remove the box you just pull it from the wall and repeat the staple steps. I see a lot of people comment about the quality of the towels and while they were thicker and a little larger in the beginning you really get what you pay for and when you buy in bulk you can't really complain, when I use to get these in the supermarket they were $5.99 a box thus tax here in Manhattan and buying in bulk here on amazon they're a little under $3.00 a box so I'm not going to complain I have seen hand towels that are thicker and larger but they also cost more (45 in a pack for $5.99 and that's on Amazon, no dispenser box...you have to put them on a flat surface and for people with kids of messy other half's that could mean wet towels) Overall I enjoy the product and even use them myself from time to time I took away 1 star for changing the quality of the product  I didn't care so much about the size change. A lot of the nurses loved the Ideal and have mentioned it to some of their patients. I do hope that Kleenex continues to make this product as I hear that it now hard to find in the stores.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

Since my initial order of 6 boxes, I have ordered another case.Each hand towel is sufficient to dry a person's hands.  I like the ease of the dispensing one towel at a time when opening the box.  The problem comes when nearing the last 20 or so towels and they no longer 'pop up' which causes a person to dig in the box to retrieve a towel.  Despite this minor annoyance, I like the product and how it feels on my hands. It is soft and supple and has good absorption.  On occasion I have used them to take care of minor clean ups on the bathroom counter and they hold up as well as most paper towels.

The company was given a fair chance to reach out and correct their mistake and chose not to. They do not stand by the product they are selling you, so do yourselves a favor and avoid buying this.The first time I ordered this, no problems. The second time, disaster. More than half the order had large creases in the paper, some so deep there are holes in the paper. The first pack of 500(that was on top) was fine. The second and third packs, more than half of the paper in them were damaged(I'm just on the 3rd pack now). They have a 30 day return/exchange policy, and there is no way to know of this before that time expires. Unless quality checks are non-existent, I cannot believe that this is not on purpose. Good paper on top, crap paper underneath. I'm a home school with one student. The only way to know that this paper was damaged would have been to open all 3 500 packs of paper, and then have 1500 loose sheets of paper just sitting around.... That's ridiculous. And people ordering this for home use, I would think the same situation would apply to them. By the time you got to the second pack, 30 days will be expired. Amazon cannot help, only send a message to the manufacturer, and then you have to wait for a reply. If they reply and take responsibility for this, I will add that to the review, but for now, do not waste your money on this unless you are willing to quality check 3 packs of 500 sheets of paper all at once. There are some products that this 30 day policy needs to be exempt from, and I feel products like this take full advantage of that policy, knowing they can get away with selling inferior products that cannot be checked within that time.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I recently purchased the 3-ream case of 92 bright, Office 20lb HP Printer Paper, and I'm extremely satisfied with its performance and value.The 92 brightness level of this paper is perfect for producing crisp, clear text and vivid images. I've found that it consistently delivers professional-quality results, regardless of whether I'm printing a simple letter or a full-color presentation. The smooth finish prevents ink smearing and bleeding, ensuring clean and sharp prints every time.The 20lb weight strikes the ideal balance between durability and affordability. This paper is sturdy enough to hold up to frequent handling, yet not so thick that it becomes cumbersome or expensive. It feeds smoothly through my printer, eliminating the frustration of jams or misfeeds.The 3-ream case provides an excellent value, offering a generous quantity of paper at a competitive price. As a bonus, the case is easy to store and keeps the paper protected from dust and damage until it's needed.Moreover, I appreciate that HP is an environmentally responsible brand, as this paper is sourced from responsibly managed forests and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This gives me peace of mind knowing that my paper choice supports sustainable forestry practices.In summary, the 92 bright, Office 20lb HP Printer Paper is a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality, affordable printer paper. The impressive brightness, ideal weight, and exceptional value make it a standout option for all your printing needs.

The information posted, plus the label on the reams states ""99% Jam Free.""  It is anything but jam free.  I have used printing/copy paper of many different weights in my laser printers for years, but never this particular brand and 20lb weight.  Never before have I suffered with paper jams in the printers.  This paper, I have suffered numerous jams on different laser printers.  The last jam, I just cleaned out of the printer, which was so severe that I had to disassemble the printer insides to get it out.  The paper sheet is so thin (cannot be 20lb!) it bunched up in a half-inch jam that it took well over an hour to disassemble the printer (using screwdriver), pry the paper bunch out using medical hemostats (the bunch broke into small chips when attempting to pull out of the mechanism), and then reassemble the printer.  It was bunched up so tightly that it was impossible to pull out just by opening the printer covers. I replaced this paper with another brand 20 LB paper that I had very little left and printing is complete and smooth, no jams.  This Hammermill paper has caused at least 8 - 10 jams, the last jam being the worst, the prior jams were pulled out by opening the printer covers.  Only a quarter of the first ream has been used, but I am now stuck with 3 reams of paper that is not even good enough for toilet paper.

It has to be why it was one of the most affordable.We have found three different weights of paper in the first reem. One of which is the actual paper as labeled but we have only seen a few pieces of it in the reem we have opened. The other paper is pretty much as low quality as you would ever want. One third or so content is paper so thin anywhere your fingers touch it causes a permanent wrinkle you cant get out. It feels like garbage and it is really obvious it doesn't belong in this reem. I've never seen paper like this before. Perhaps it isnt copy paper and maybe it is meant for some purpose I dont know about.. but the brightness is so off it looks nearly transparent and a blueish gray..I dont know how something like this could happen but it did and we are the unlucky buyers.Our advice is buyer beware.

I buy A4 because I happen to like the size. Anyhow...I have no real issues with what I received; however, as can be seen from the photos, the ream package was pretty significantly torn open. I left it in the outer clear plastic wrapper so there would be no question this was the condition in which I received it. It's hard to say if this happened at the seller's location or due to shipping, but nevertheless the package was *not* flawless.In the process of writing this review, I have now opened the package, and the paper seems fine.

I bought 5 boxes (50 reams total) for my company and literally every ream we tried resulted in a paper jam. There did not seem to be anything wrong with the paper. It was neat and without imperfections and they were all wrapped in the poly wrap that it came in. But it just kept jamming the printer. Sometimes we would get multiple jams per ream, much less one in 10,000, which I will go over in a bit.Our company prints up to 4000 pages in a business day so paper is very important, and as you can imagine it becomes very annoying to clear multiple paper jams in a day when every ream has at least one jam. This should be called the Bob Marley of paper... because it's always Jammin.Attached are printouts of the print error activities. All of the jam events were from this Hammermill paper. We switched back to other paper that we got and everything was fine.When the paper actually does cycle and print, it looks as you would expect. Nothing special about its brightness or print quality, especially since we are printing on an enterprise HP printer.I reached out to Hammermill to see if they would honor the jam free guarantee that you see in the images and on the packaging itself, which states: ""no more than one jam in 10,000 sheets or we'll replace the paper or refund the pruchase price."" No response in 3 weeks. So I have recycled what we have left and have gone to a different brand. We will just buy from another brand and never from Hammermill again.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It is impossible to smooth out all the curled up pages to be able to try to put them through again, so I am loosing use of roughly 50% of the paper in my first ream.

Carter, Esq.","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2016",3,"I have been buying this particular brand of copier paper for a few years because it's usually very well priced for the quality and brightness. In the past, the individual reams would be packaged in paper, and when the delivery guy dropped the carton off at my front door, half or more of the reams inside the carton would tear apart. This would dry out the paper as it sat on the shelf waiting to be used.Now they are wrapping the paper reams in plastic. But that's no better. While the reams stay intact inside the carton, they are almost impossible to open without using utility knives or scissors. It's enough of an annoyance to have to refill the paper in the copier let alone having to do battle with the wrapper on the paper ream. Besides, with all the plastic finding its way into the ocean these days, I find it ironic that Hammermill would design a school of swimming fish for its wrapper. Why can't Hammermill show some environmental consciousness and go back to paper wrappers that are designed to open easily but strong enough not to tear in impact.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": -1, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

HOWEVER, the paper quality is 100% not what you’re used to seeing out in the wild. What I mean by this is that it’s not what you would find or use for printing purposes like you would at schools, offices, and etc. The paper is sort of like a sheet of paper you’d find in a kids college ruled notebook but just blank and slightly shorter. Besides that it’s paper and works well, just you’ll notice the difference when held and people will find it odd when you hand it to them. It’s not a bad thing but it’s just differentFor all normal purposes it works fine and with the amount you get from this, you won’t have issue finding scrap paper or drawing paper anytime soon.

They are cheap and as such I bought them as a single use product. While I’m not a fan of single use anything I don’t do very much painting ever, so I bought the cheapest thing with the fastest delivery. They were intended to make very small touch ups to an enamel paint job I did on a few PC components both plastic and metal. I dipped themWith just a tiny drop of paint to just dot on a few 1 square millimeter gaps in the spray paint job where my masking tape was over cut by just a hair. I was applying a tiny little drop of paints in areas only marginally bigger than a pin head. The entire brush didn’t see paint, just a little dot on the tip. Some how transferring a trivial amount of paint smaller than a single drop of water resulted in bristles on my paint job. Given I was touching up an enamel paint job and enamel can take a week or more to fill cure those bristles got into the original base cost. Trying to get the bristles out pulled up the not fully cured base coat. This caused me to have to remove the paint from my entire piece, re-sand it, and start all over again. This is a cheap product and as such I asked very little of it and it cost me several hours of restarting a project because it failed mechanically in the most basic fundamental requirement of a paint brush lol.

The colors blend well together, and the way that they are set up, is a wonderful idea, as long as your Bible is the size that allows 5 tabs in a row, (an 8.6"" Bible is perfect), but your tabs won't look like the photo, for example, if your Bible is Large, and you need to use 6 tabs to fill your template sizing, then the color combination that they show in the photo will be mixed. It took me 3 purchases to get a good set of tabs. The first set that I purchased had a noticeable white line going all the way down one group of tabs, and the MFG. replaced those, but when the replacement group came, they had gotten badly CREASED in shipping, so I ordered a third set, which were fine. Here is the PROBLEM. Beauty aside, the packaging comes in 8.5 X 11-inch sheets of tabs. Most companies make the pages half that size. The 8.5 X 11 sheet makes them vulnerable because they ship them in a BAG of some sort, either bubble or thick paper, with NO CARD STOCK inside the package of tabs for SUPPORT of the product, which many times causes them to bend easily. The tabs themselves are MUCH thinner stock than other competitive brands, like Mr. Pen, and they are a bit ""flimsy"" when working with them. At first, I liked the nicely squared lines of the edges of the tabs, since it seemed like it would be easier to fit them very squarely into place. Not true. I am a quilter, and I am very sensitive to exact measurements. Every tab has 2 edges on either side of the tab, which should be squared nicely, but 1 side is about a 16th of an inch OFF, so when you go to put the tab in, it doesn't line up squarely with your printed text in your Bible, and if you push it so that it is nicely straight with the writing in the Bible, then it is Crooked when you go to close the tab, folding it to make it stick in the Bible. You are constantly correcting, to make it squared and make it look nice. I am a perfectionist, and the overall look of the Bible with the tabs in place was definitely BEAUTIFUL, since the group of tabs were placed on a Bible that was Grey in color, with the Crown of Thorns Etched in Black, so the esthetics of the entire piece was really nice.  This company has the right idea, but they should put some cardboard in their package, so that the product is less vulnerable to aggressive shipping clerks.  Also, with a product this beautiful, if it were my company, I would make the tabs themselves just a tiny bit thicker or even make them laminated for durability. I have my concerns that these will not hold up under heavy use. It's a shame, because the tabs themselves really are pretty!!",0,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 0, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

However, while the colors are bright and attractive, I've found that they don't adhere as well as the name-brand counterparts. Despite being labeled as sticky notes, they tend to lose their grip after a short period, leading to frequent reapplication or, worse, notes falling off surfaces altogether. As a teacher, I intended to use these for assignments and classroom organization, but my students have taken a different approach. Rather than using them for their intended purpose, they've turned them into collectibles, insisting on having every color in their collection. This has resulted in a messy situation, with random pieces of sticky notes scattered across the classroom floor. To prevent further distraction, I've decided to hide these sets until next year, when I hope to use them more effectively for assignments. Until then, I'll stick to the reliable name-brand sticky notes for classroom use.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

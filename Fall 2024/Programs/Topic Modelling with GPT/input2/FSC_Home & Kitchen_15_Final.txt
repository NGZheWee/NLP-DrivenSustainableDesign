Well really. The quality of this brand has gone down. The wax paper is so thin you can't even get some off the roll and get your food wrapped with it without it tearing all up on you. Also I was not happy to see they no longer even put a cardboard core in the center of the roll so I was unable to take the roll from the cheesy thin box it comes in and put it on my wall dispenser I have for all my wraps and paper towel roll.

I used it to bake sourdough bread in Dutch oven and this was the first time and last using it.Although it says NON-STICK, it is not true. This paper is either old or poor quality.

Both ends of wax paper box was torn. very difficult to get paper out. Very disappointed!

Had NO cardboard inside roll,  waxed paper was all over and bound up on wood roller.

There is now no cardboard roll, so after you're partway through the box, the role of wax paper squishes and becomes increasingly difficult to easily pull out and tear off in a straight line. The cardboard box itself is much thinner, so that doesn't help since it also squishes.365 by Whole Foods Market Wax Paper isn't the answer either — there is no metal cutting edge, so tearing a piece off results in ragged wax paper edges.By comparison, Winco wax paper has both a roll and a cutting edge, so among these three brands, that's the best choice.

For reasons known only to Reynolds they have taken the cardboard tube out of the roll of waxed paper making it nearly useless. My wife and I have used their waxed paper all of our lives and will never buy another roll without the cardboard tube.

The food gets stuck on it, wouldn’t buy it again.

box opened and flattened shipping-dirty looking

If I wanted parchment paper I would have ordered it. This is not wax paper

THE ABOVE PICTURE IS HOW THE NEWLY DESIGNED PACKAGE LOOKS AFTER ABOUT A WEEKNew FLIMSY box with no center cardboard. The box  collapses after a few usings  and you have to reach inside with your fingers to pull out thewax paper and the paper cutter cuts your fingers CHEAP packaging

Junk junk junk.  Smokes at low temp.  Just junk

Haven't found one thing this doesn't Stick to

I bought 2 rolls to refill our wax paper dispenser, but it doesn't fit because it no longer has a cardboard roll at the center!!!

There is no cardboard core - impossible to tear, pull out of dispenser that caves & falls apart. So not worth the frustration. Will buy Waxtex in store.

One roll had tear about every 10” that kept repeating.

Awful quality super thin q

Didn't like it at all, gave it away.1) when putting it in the oven under food, my smoke alarm went on constantly because of this.2) the food got stuck to it and I had to rip the food off this. Different types of food, not just one thing.Was not happy with my purchase. Sorry

It is ok for Reynolds to continue selling Cut-Rite Wax Paper, so long as they rename it Cut-Rate Wax Paper. They removed the strong cardboard roll from the product, likely as a cost-cutting measure and to improve the bottom line, while bilking the customer. So now we get a flimsy roll that falls apart, the box opens up, and it doesn't tear well. The brass at the company should be given big raises, limousines, and fancy cigars. Their contact form doesn't even work.

Cheap thin quality

Box of WAX paper trashed

Reynolds has decided to remove the circular cardboard roll from the center of the wax paper roll and also the cardboard box seems thinner and less sturdy than in the past.These two things make it horribly difficult to get the wax paper out and to cut it easily using the edge cutter.I have already switched to another brand!!

I sprayed the sheets with oil before using them for brittle almond candy. It stuck to them all, even after oiling the "oiled" paper!  ruined everything

Waxed paper was sent in same box as 3 large Tide bottles, 4 kleenex, & fabric softener sheets.  And yep, the wax paper smells strongly of fabric softener.  Unusable!

Extremely overpriced

So cheap and it’s the wax that is not for the oven it has the plastic coating.

Don't waste your money.

The media could not be loaded.

I bought a roll of this recently, and will echo what some previous reviewers said. The wax paper is noticeably thinner than it used to be, and tears much more easily if you cut anything on it. The safety tabs on the box are gone, meaning you have to open the box, fish out the end of the wax paper, re-close the box, pull out the length you need, and tear. A pain when you're busy doing food prep, and much easier to cut yourself on the serrated metal strip. AND the inner cardboard roll is gone- a hassle when you get toward the end of the roll. They kept the price low by making a significantly inferior product. I'm switching to parchment paper unless I can find a better brand...

In April 2021, an EPA-certified lab tested Reynolds Kitchen Parchment Paper for total fluorine and found 14 parts per million (ppm). This means that PFAS was not intentionally added to the product, but Mamavation cannot recommend the product because of the small amount of PFAS found

Sadly, Reynold's has chosen to cut their costs by changing the decades-old carton. The new carton no longer has the safety-minded "punch outs" in the carton which allowed you to easily feed the wax paper without fear of the knife edge cutter. These "punch outs" are gone on the new carton. My wife has already cut her finger with the new carton while trying to feed out the wax paper roll.Further, the cardboard-tube core is now gone. As one gets to the end of the roll, it just a big mess.Now there is little (if any) difference between the higher priced Reynold's product and generic brands. The Reynold's carton was a real advantage and now they've decided to simply throw that advantage away ...all for the most tiny increase in their profit. Dumb move. Really dumb.

it came smashed and flat. Not happy that I can return it

Too expensive. I didn't realize that I could buy this much cheaper from any grocery store.

I found out the hard way this is way over priced. I would say about $2. or more. Big mistake ,won't happen again.

Cut-Rite is no longer the product I've used for my 8 decades of life.  Thinner paper.  No core.  Thinner carton.  No finger cutout on carton to aid paper dispensing.  Lucky I still had the old carton.  May not matter without that core.  Will look for a substitute.  Reynolds is killing this product.  So sorry

Gets burnt!!

My last few rolls have had no cardboard tube inside; it just contains waxed paper rolled on itself.  Imagine buying toilet paper without the cardboard tube inside.

They've taken out the cardboard tube inside the roll. Now the whole roll collapses in on itself the minute you try to use it. Might as well throw the whole thing  away.  Garbage!!

I love to buy from Amazon for the convenience. I easily place more than 100 orders with them a year. I generally am relatively price insensitive, but for fun, I priced this in my local grocery store where it retails for $2.29 with actual cost being a fraction of that amount.At time of review, Amazon has it priced at $5.97. --  it appears that Amazon is marking this up more than 200% above its cost which strikes me as excessive. I did a double take to make sure the Amazon price was for a single, 75 sq tf.  roll, and guess what? It is.Cutrite waxed paper -- a great product, but buy it elsewhere unless you want to take a haircut.

The back clearly says "MAKE BAKING EASIER" "Line bottom of cake pans for easy removal after baking" It was these two lines that lead me to believe that it was oven safe. This is not the case. It smoked up my house and ruined my danishes. Please remove this from the packaging and write on the front DO NOT USE IN OVENS.

WORTHLESS!!!!  Sticks to everything, AND it breaks down and disintegrates when rolling out pie dough whether it is over or under dough. This brand USED to be great (decades ago) for lining counter for dough rolling, but it has gotten thinner and much more flimsy. This product is basically GOOD FOR NOTHING, except the garbage pail@!

This paper is as good for baking as the office paper. When baking, It sticks and tears down way to easy spoiling the bakery.From the packaging label:"Chocolate candies & dipped strawberries won't stick to the wax paper" - lie, the paper sticks to the cookies and tears down when you try to remove the paper."Line bottom of cake pans for easy removal after baking" - lie, it sticks to the cake.Perhaps the paper is ok for lining countertops but I would never use it for baking anymore

Seriously!everything STICKS to this wax paper.Tater-Tots, Roast Potatoes, Burgers, Spring Rolls.Pastries, Pies, cookies and EVERYTHING!!you name it, it SICKS to this paper and becomes a hassle to un-stick it before serving.its easier to use Aluminium Foil.I cant understand how a product can fail so badly.other than tracing paper, this product is useless! i am completely disappointed.i have no problem to  waste a few minutes of my day to go online and RANT against this useless product.find a better brand, or use Aluminium Foil.

I have just spent 30 minutes peeling this paper off the bottom of my goodies...wilton paper worked the best for me so far

Cut rite wax paper is a fine product but the packaging was terrible. I had to tape both ends of the box. It won’t tear off very well if the ends aren’t secure. Please tell your employees to take more pride in their work. Would they send something like that to their mother?

I have always used this wax paper. It was always used at my house when I was a kid before plastic wrap became the thing. I prefer having paper touching food and will even use wax paper on food before putting in plastic for freezing. All that said I have never been so frustrated with any food wrap box as I am with the new Reynold's Wrap wax paper box. They took out the cardboard tube. There is zero stability when trying to unroll and tear. It gets worse the more you use. And they still have the little indents in the ends that helped with the cardboard tube but do nothing for the flimsy roll of wax paper. If you're trying to conserve or help the environment, think about a user friendly box design first. They saved a few bucks but still charge the same. See the photo, I taped two chopsticks together, stuck them through the end holes and secured them with more tape. It helps. Absolutely ridiculous.

All that can recommend buying this on Amazon:  it's cheap.  But you get what you pay for.  Inside the box, it is clear that someone has taken the wax paper (maybe from a larger roll) and re-rolled it and put tape on to hold it together.  It gets worse.  After using the wax paper once or twice, the cardboard box falls apart. Then it's nearly impossible to cut cleanly across the razor edge - so I get various shapes of torn was paper to use and often have to throw away the piece and try again.  This is not a "one off."  I have ordered this many times (never learn?) and each time the same poor quality defective product.  Amazon either do better or sell us a product that's not re-made or from "seconds" - sell us the real deal please.

Have used this brand for decades, and had purchased a roll here to refill a vintage wall dispenser.  Was angry and shocked to find there was no cardboard core! This caused me to have to tediously re-roll the entire 75' roll by hand onto the old core.  Guess I'll have to use dollar store wax paper to get what I need. Sad.Even in its own box, it just doesn't pull the same without the core.

I use cut rite wax paper regularly. The price was not competitive as I've  come to expect on Amazon. The product was substandard. Dry not flexible, tore and punched through easily.

I like the product, other than they changed it. There is no longer a carboard tube. This makes it difficult to use once you get to the end of the wax paper. Not as sturdy as previously wax paper. This shipment of bwax paper were smashed.

The roll fails to provide a cutting strip for ease of use. This makes it messy to use. I prefer the precut sheets. Unfortunately it is not so easy to get these days!

No words needed.

I got tired of all my food sticking in the oven, I thought this would help but it’s sticking to the paper now!! Lol 😂 if you wasn’t something that will prevent from sticking this is not it!!

The product was damaged when received

The box always comes really dented or ripped.

The cutter doesn't cut the paper. Have to use scissors.

I was the sucker here, quickly adding this to an order without checking the price at other stores. If you are paying more than $2, you are overpaying.  I bought wax paper at Whole Foods that was less than half the price.

The manufacture no longer uses a cardboard tube as the base for the wax paper. This makes it difficult to tear a sheet off.

For some reason this was not available in my local stores. Comes in handy for wrapping snacks in to freeze them.

I like my waxed paper like I like my women....Humble and hard working.

Wax paper has a multitude of uses from cleaning your can opener to smoothing out wood when my wax paper arrived. The box that it sits in it has the little teeth for ripping off as much as you need was completely wet, then it dried and now it’s all water damaged. The wax paper appears just fine. The box, however looks like it’s been through hell, I’m not gonna bother with sending it back to Amazon because quite frankly it’s annoying to return things and I keep my wax paper hidden in the cupboard anyway so no one else is going to see it and by the time I get a sheet ripped off and put the damn thing back in the cupboard. I would’ve forgotten how crappy the other packaging is , it’ll just irritate me every time I pull it out and make me happy when I put it back that would be an incentive for me to keep it off my counter and underfoot yours probably will arrive just fine so go ahead and buy it like I said, multitudes of uses for wax paper  And just like buying a bag to hold down my bags I am not gonna buy a box to hold on my rolls of wax paper, tinfoil, etc. those are more of a pain in the behind the net worth anyhow, happy wax paper in if you’re old-school like me, you can tolerate quite a lot and Reynolds wrap happens to be a good company  Well at least they were back in the day

One end of my wax paper was smashed. Makes it hard to roll out and hard to cut

Thin material that splits easily. Cutter on the box is useless. Wish I could find something better.

Carton was smashed because of poor packingProduct was difficult to use because of damage

The product is good but it was banged up in the shipping box making the wax paper difficult to dispense.

The side was damaged. Missing a piece of the box that covers the side. Other than that, it's as expected.

I like it.

I have used the Cut-Rite brand wax paper all of my life and I was so very happy when I saw this wax paper on Amazon for such a great price.  Sadly, I didn't find out until I was halfway through the roll that there is no cardboard roll.  Soooo, when I'd try to cut some wax paper the entire roll literally flies out of the box.

Arrived late, ends were open

It is very thin and it sticks to food when you wrap and freeze it. wax layer is thin and inner cardboard roll was bent.

This used to be amazing paper but they have OBVIOUSLY made it thinner and cheaper quality, which is predictable of companies these days... hence three stars which i rarely do... i had a box from over a year ago and the paper was twice as thick as what it is today...😑

The product is exactly what one expects--waxed paper. I wouldn't say it was better or worse than other options, but I generally don't buy anything but Reynolds products in the first place.  That's the reason I only gave it an "okay" rating.  To say I love it would be making a statement based on no comparative data.

It's okay for packaging but probably not so much for steaming or baking (what I originally bought it for). Just buy parchment paper. It's only a couple cents more and better quality.

Was surprised to find this waxed paper was thinner than usual. Like waxed tissue paper.

it's ok

Its ok product

3/21/23 Update: Reynolds have changed the packaging by making the box smaller without the core that holds the paper.  The paper seems thinner as well.  The box and paper tears too easily.  Companies continue to change products and charge more.I grew using the Reynolds wax paper is it sturdy/strong.  In the past, I have purchased this product from Walmart, Target and Kmart from $1.39 to $1.59 for the 75 ft roll.  Today I purchased Reynolds wax paper,  the 60 ft roll from the Dollar General for $1.00 per roll.  I stocked up and will not need wax paper anytime soon.

Purchased this from Amazon when I couldn't find it at the grocery and the cost was 3x more.  Found better pricing locally after a quick search online.

I have only used this a couple of times along with crafting dies and it works fine. I haven't used it for baking so cant comment on its other use!!

Useful but damaged packaging

Did what it was meant to do, took a while to arrive

waited ages for this item, and I'm not sure that I'm using it properly so will go back to the drawing board, but thank youquality is good

This wax paper is great! I ordered two rolls, since I use it for a variety of different things. One roll stays in the kitchen for all the kitchen and food type stuff. The other roll goes in the shop to protect surfaces for things like gluing, painting, applying polyurethane, epoxy, and so forth. This paper is fairly thin and moisture gets through with some paints and glues, but that’s a simple fix. I just put a paper towel or napkin on the outer side to absorb any moisture while the product dries.The one star deduction is because both rolls came squished and distorted. You couldn’t tell by the outside of the box, but somehow the cylindrical tubes holding the wax paper inside the box were a mess. I tried to reform the tubes without much luck. This makes it a challenge to tear off even pieces of waxed paper. The paper itself however, is great!

I ordered 2 boxes. They were shipped UPS in a thin plastic envelope. Both boxes were damaged.

It cuts easily, is fairly cheap & works well when I'm heating food in microwave & don't want it to splatter.Just don't let it touch the actual food itself when heating as that's not healthy.

Like I said, it's just plain old wax paper. I was just too lazy to go to the store to get ONE thing...Hats off to Amazon for EXACTLY this kind of purchase.  Great seller!  Thank you 👍

I like the brand and have used it for years.  I line baking dishes and use it between frozen items before freezing certain foods.  Several times a week I lay my biscuit dough out for cutting.  It’s so much easier to cleanup after cabinet has been used to cut and roll out pastry.

The serrated cutting edge is only mediocre--no clean cut. The wax paper itself is fine as long as you don't need a clean cut.

I love this brand wax paper. Some others feel so cheap. I do think it’s much cheaper to just buy at the grocery store but sometimes we pay for convenience.

Adequate.

Its just Wax Paper but the very good brand, the quality was good, the shipping was good, and they bundled it together very well.

Purchased for $2.54 each.  So, totally worth it.Only thing that would have made this an awesome deal is if the paper was thicker.Otherwise, very happy for what we got.  Thank you for the great price vs what else is being sold.

I have used this for 50 years. It is the best. I prefer it over Foil.Highly recommend.

I use this wax paper for so many different things, so I tend to go through alot of it.  I line book shelves with it.  I line my shoe rack with it to prevent dirt from falling onto the bottom racks.  I cover boxes with it so they do not collect dust.  Oh, and I also use it to wrap leftover food (probably it's main intended purpose, Lol).It's good stuff, and I like this brand better than the one I used to buy, the Whole Foods 365 brand.  I did however dock the rating one start because the Cut-Rite paper used to be thicker and now it is fairly thin.  So sometimes I have to double it up.  Still, a great product for the money, and very versatile.

There are so many ways to use it in the freezer, baking, cooking in my microwave oven or even arts and crafts. I use this product a lot when baking cookies, I lay them down to put the warm cookies onto it for cooling. I wouldn't use any other brand as this wax paper is always high quality and reliable.If you find my review helpful, kindly vote below to help for future reviews as well. Thank you.

It is pretty standard for wax paper. Not super thick, but the same you would get if you picked it up in a store. It has the advantage of being available through subscribe and save. At least for me, having something like this available through subscribe and save makes it easier to remember to buy, since it is not something I am always thinking of when going to, or ordering from, the grocery store.

Unusable

It's wax paper. I've used it my entire life.

They gave off an unpleasant burning odor when i put it in my oven.

This wax paper is great. But I do feel that wax paper could be more reasonable

Good quality product, my wife is happy with this purchase

This product is good for cake making

Needed this for some baking. Does what it needs

Which reminds me..I need more!

I use this brand of wax paper and have for years.  I will continue to buy this brand.

It's wax paper...just what I needed.

Works like it's supposed to.

It worked for what I needed it to do, but not prefect. I used it to keep Fiberglass resin from sticking on the backside of a garage door. I think the wax was not applied evenly thus the thin areas stuck to the resin. Release tape would have worked better, but this was a ultra low budget attempt to repair large holes in a fiberglass garage door.

Having experienced problems removing a die-cut from a cheaper make of die, this was a god-send. However, I do have to admit to a bit of a problem removing the wax paper from the die-cut!On balance it is still worthwhile as the resulting die-cut is good.

An essential piece of kit for using between an intricate die and the card - although there will often be dies that are still hard to extract, you will not be spending so long in doing so!

Yes this was exactly what I wanted, didn't take to long was happy with my goods.

This wax paper is great for die-cutting.  It makes getting the die pieces out so easy.

works well

good value for money.  easy to use, works just as expected, makes using delicate cutting dies much easier, would recommend to anyone.

i am using this paper on my inkjet printer for transfer printing...it is giving very interesting results...i will be buying more!

Does what it says

Wanted it for photo copying on to wood, hood for transferIng photos

Did what I wanted it to do. Helped to remove the card from the dies quickly and without tearing.Iwould recommend this product

This wax paper works perfectly with my craft dies. Will certainly buy it again and would recommend it to crafters.

Perfect for using with die cutting machine

prompt delivery, as described, thank you

Useful.

Great stuff!

I bought after viewing a professional chef make homemade cookie cakes on TikTok. Glad I purchased for my homemade cookie cake experience. It worked great! As you can see, it was easy to use, was a good value for the money, and was sturdy (I used and pulled up many times and no holes). Highly recommend!

I've tried other brands only because I couldn't find Cut-Rite in any of the retail stores.  This is the best one, stronger and holds up better.

good price

My idea is working very well. I have flowers and butterflies, they’re wall decals on my blue walls. But they are starting to pop up. I don’t want to lose them, so as I take them off I am rolling them into the roll of wax paper. When I find another use for them they’ll be ready. And I will still have my roll of CUT-RITE.

good product

It's waxed paper.  What else is there to say.  If you need paper that's a bit waxy, buy this stuff

Perfect

I think I saved money here as compared to buying in the store

its fine

Easy to use and very easy to cut with the new blade

The price for this waxed paper is cheaper than at the local grocery store.

This wax paper will change your life... it's paper... covered with wax. glue doesn't stick to it. you can use it to wrap your sandwich. it cam be slippy-slidey  this is the wax paper of all wax paper... providing you need a 12-inch wide roll that is 75 feet long

Just as intended this product never fails for your baking needs.

I use it for putting my puzzles on to glue them together. It doesn't stick like like poster boards I was using. It sticks a little but easy to take off.

I use a lot of wax paper in the kitchen and this is very good.

What can you say it’s been around for years

essential product; best price i could find anywhere.GReAt.<<<<=|  A+++  |=>>>>

Amazing how few markets carry a simple and inexpensive food wrap that is a preferred wrap for raw meats.

As expected - good value for name brand

Easy to use, lays flat on my cookie sheets. Thick enough and sturdy.

Can’t find this in the stores near me. :-(  So, hello Amazon!

For rapping goods for the freezer

Good price

As described

I use this all the time and I can’t believe what a great price it was. Cost twice as much in stores near me. Definitely worth keeping on my buy again list.

… that will be covered first, then (2nd) by foil. Aluminum foil can leech into food possible adding more sodium, etc.

Perfect for my fake cookies.

I buy ground meat in bulk and use this wax paper to wrap for freezing. It prevents freezer burn and the wax prevents the paper from sticking. Very useful.

When you need it, there it is

Good quality wax paper. I have always use it.

Honestly, I could not find wax paper in a store (Walmart, Sam's, neighborhood market) for about a YEAR. It never occurred to me to check Amazon until one day it did. I thought they had stopped making it all together, but I found it here, the price was amazing, I got two rolls. I'm so happy to have it, it comes in handy for certain purposes The two rolls will probably be five years' worth.....

Of course, she cannot go wrong with Reynolds rap, not much to say, but wax paper serves its purpose.

A blast from the past but I use it every day-better than plastic wrap for most things

Wife's review: This is a great product! I bought this online because I knew it would be a while before we made it to the store again.TIP:If you're having trouble getting it to stay in your pan, crumple it into a tight ball first, and then uncrumple it and lay it out. If you're still having trouble getting it to stay, spritz a little water or oil on the back of the wax paper to get it to stick (or you can do this without first crumpling it).

If you are looking for wax paper, look no further. Great product.

I grab it regularly when I need to "dump something" without messing up a dish.  Or protecting my food such as a sandwich from the countertop as I prepare it.  I'm 81 years old and I can't remember a time when it wasn't in my kitchen (and my mother's).  When I lived in Ecuador for a brief time, I had to take Cut-Rite with me because it wasn't available there.  Also took dill pickles as they weren't available there either.

great wax paper for my current project at hand.  Exterior end of box was tattered but it's wax paper so I'm not going to tilt.  On time, affordable

Good quality

This works just as well as the pricier product Always looking for a bargain. Actually purchased this to use in my Ninja air fryer! Does the job. It's a high quality product for less $$$.

Yes, Wax Paper is not as easy as plastic bags. But don't you care about the swirling mess of plastics in the ocean? The animals that are contaminated with microplastics in their brains, blood, and organs (and yes, that includes us). We need to get rid of plastic as much as possible. So BUY WAX PAPER and learn the art of making sandwich bags! We also line plastic containers that will hold food with wax paper. Did you know we ingest little pieces of plastic when we have food stuffs stored in it? Water bottles are included in that, too. Ditch the plastic and save the world.

Came thru UPS and had to pick up at location locally, box bent up but I have old one for re use. I could have bought at Walmart. Thought I’d try this. It was ok.

Practically the only time I use waxed paper is when making sandwiches.  Wrap up sandwiches and burgers so you don't get drips of mayo, tuna, egg salad, etc. squishing out the bottom of the sandwich and running down your arm.  Just tear away the paper as you eat and your problem is solved.  So handy.

Really like this wax paper. Can be used for so many things besides food. Such as crafts, drawer liners and window decor. Good quality paper.

Wax paper queen

hard to find wax paper

I like to have wax paper on hand for craft projects and to cover dishes while reheating in the microwave. I can’t find it in the grocery stores by me. Amazon to the rescue again.

I said it all in the title

If you haven't purchased this item recently you need to read the reviews.If you (like me) order this from your "Buy Again" page you, again, like me, you will NOT get what you think you were purchasing.Amazon and/or Scott should have explained this UP FRONT!HINT - the only clue but NO explanation is in the title ".. Compact Case for Easy Storage ..."I'm not adding to the photos others have posted here so look at those and read the reviews.Each bundle of towels is 1/3 smaller than they used to be BUT the have the same count per bundle (published I did NOT count) BUT each bundle weighs just over an ounce less. That's a lot of paper fiber GONE !Less paper = LESS ABSORBENCY!I reject this and already filed for and received a "RETURN" order.This may qualify as "Bait and Switch" or just an oversight but is seems (by amount of feedback about this) that Amazon / Scott has had plenty of time to correct and/or explain and redo the description.For now I am ordering another brand but doing a deep dive into purchasers reviews / comments.Also I'm no longer just clicking on "Buy Again" without "Do Diligence".

The paper is so thin I can see throught it. When it get wet it's even worst, you need at least 3 pieces to dry your hands. Such a waste of money.

I also just received my auto shipment of Scott paper towels and was shocked at the difference in size of the paper towel packaging and the box they came in.  Cheaper to ship for them as the down size the towel and they obviously removed 1/3 of material from the towels and they are wafer thin and almost worthless in wiping up spills or absorbing any liquid.  Actually I'm using more towels to compensate.Not buying Scott anymore and  I'm returning mine + the price went up.  Makes no sense and no explanation.  Very deceiving and I just spent an hour researching to make sure that somehow they might have shipped me the wrong item. These newly packaged towels come with the the same item number printed on the outside: 01840  16 x 250 sheets = 4000 on the box's outer graphics.As others have stated you get the same size sheet. You get the same amount of total sheets. You do not get the same thickness / absorbency of sheets at a higher price.

The product is not a good quality product on promotion, it is a cheap product represented as a good quality product on promotion.- They rip easily when pulling from the dispenser.- They barely absorb any moisture at all.- Once wet, they fall apart when rubbing your hands.- They are wafer thin.- The box they arrived in was significantly smaller than prior purchases, that was an indication that they misrepresented the product.Lesson learned, back to Costco for the better quality paper towels.

I was satisfied with my previous purchases of this scott multifold towel,  but this one is thinner, you have to use more than one to dry your hands or wipe anything, and the package is little over half the size,  amazon, you've drop the ball on this, cannot recommend it.

SCOTT should be ashamed of themselves. Obviously making a killing during this pandemic, yet dumping this crap on us?  We are all struggling to find quality paper products. I've never had problems getting paper towels out of my dispensers until now.I thought this was a good deal based on quantity, but when I took one out of our dispenser - it ripped. Thinking it was a fluke I grabbed another, same thing...ripped!Frustrated, I compared it to the brand that we'd been using before.  These are slightly smaller, super wrinkled and SIGNIFICANTLY thinner. I mean so thin you can literally read through it (see photo). What the...! Kleenex is thicker.  My old brand is thicker, sturdy, FLAT and can be used wet to scrub the sink.  SCOTT'S rip when they're dry!I would have to use three of these to dry my hands...if I could even get them out of the dispenser first!  I guess I'll save these for emergency backup as kleenex.  I won't be buying any more SCOTT products as they obviously care nothing about their consumers!My old brand is Georgia-Pacific Professional Series Premium 1-Ply.  I've been buying that for 3 years from Amazon.  I strayed because I thought I could get more.  But quantity is not a replacement for quality.  The photos speak for themself.I'll be happy if I keep anyone else from being ripped off, especially during times like these.

Echoing other customers' recent reviews, these newly packaged towels come with the item number printed on the outside:  01840 [04].  The previous version was:  01840 [03].  Beware:  "04" doesn't mean you get more even though it still says 16 x 250 = 4000 on the box's outer graphics.Here's the catch:  You get the same size sheet.  You get the same amount of total sheets.  You do not get the same thickness / absorbency of sheets.  On top of it, when I last purchased these in December ( the older, thicker quality towels, the [03] version ) they cost a four dollars less.  Now?  I get LESS costing MORE!  What a deal!Yes, inflation is a pain with costs of items like multi-fold towels increasing, but an item decreasing in quality when costing the same ( or more ) adds insult to injury.  Consider yourself informed now.  I trusted things to stay "business as usual".  Nope.

Been using these for years and they were minimum thickness to be useable. Now they cheeped out and made them worthless. The old ones were .006 to .007 thick and now there only .004 and when you try to pull them out of the dispenser you only get the little piece your grasping. Will be returning and looking for a new replacement.

Advertised as 16 packs for a total of 4000 paper towels - there is NO WAY - look at the size difference.  Box is 2/3 the size of Marathon.  There is NO absorbancy you need 2 to dry your hands.  Stick with marathon and instacart the order since Amazon doesn't have in stock 90% of the time

I have bought Kleenex trifold paper towels for many years but they,  like everything else, has gone up significantly so I tried Scott Trifolds. For every one Kleenex trifold, you need four Scott's because they are paper thin and are not absorbent. Lesson learned......going back to Kleenex!!!

These are literally the absolute worst paper towels I have ever come across! They are so paper thin and shred with the slightest bit of friction from your paper towel dispenser! You need like 4-5 of these just to dry your hands! I’m SO upset that I spent $50 for this box of absolute trash! I can’t believe these are even on the market, this is truly one of the most disappointing purchases I’ve ever made! Please save your money and buy something that is higher quality! These are not it!!!

This paper is too weak to dispense properly.  The paper is so thin that pulling it from a dispensor usually results in tearing off a small shred of the sheet instead of a full sheet. Worthless.

What happened to this product? I buy this all the time and this is such a drastic change in your product! I own a daycare and been using this paper towel for many many years. The paper towel is smaller and thinner now! I even double-checked, triple-checked if I got the right one and it’s the same serial number from my last purchase before this. I still have my last purchase and cut the old box to make it like a dispenser inside my pantry. I put the new paper towels and you can see how much of a difference with the size. It’s paper thin it’s like see-through! I am so disappointed!

Worst towels I have ever ordered. Not perforated enough---all joined together by more than an inch. Real handy for real life---NOT!

Don't waste your money! It seems like this used to be a better product, but now it's impossible to pull out one sheet without pulling out 8!! waste of money and annoying.

Don't usually write negative reviews but these paper towels were the worst we ever used. Small, thin, we usually had to use two to dry our hands. would not recommend.

Literally HALF the size of normal package.  Claims to be "compact" but the fact of the matter is that the new towels are thinner, physically lighter by weight for the 250 counts, and they feel cheap compared to what they used to be.Switch it back. I don't want "compact" towels - I want high quality towels like what you used to sell!

Package is MUCH smaller with exactly the same description. Not professional to switch. Will NEVER buy again. Exactly the same product number. This is bait and switch. I agree with Jim, we will also notify Atty General.

It is now paper thin, you can see through it. It's flimsy and not absorbent. I have this on subscription and it's definitely different from what I usually receive. Waste of my money. Do not purchase.

Scott has apparently decided they weren’t making enough money on these towels, so they’ve engaged in the same kind of “greed-flation” many other companies are engaging in these days. Instead of raising the price, they just give you less quantity. Each sheet is now so thin that each packaged stack, is only 2/3 as tall as it used to be. Now it takes a pack and nearly a half to fill the same dispenser which used to be full with one pack of these paper towels. They’re also, as you might expect, not nearly as absorbent, so both the quantity and the quality have gone way down. I will never be buying these towels again. Way to go, Scott!

Don't get fool by the company saiding the box is smaller but the towels are the same.  Not true!

I've bought these for years.  They've never been especially absorbent, they've never been especially thick, they've never been especially strong, but they're useful for a variety of jobs.  Not any more.  The towels in the new case I bought are barely thicker than one-ply toilet paper.  They fall apart almost as easily as toilet paper.  No mention in the description of any change in product, only a mention of a change in packaging.  Bait and switch?--absolutely.  All for a higher price.  This'll be my last case.  If I'm going to pay a higher price, I'll find a better product.

These are to thin. They’re soft, but you need more than one to dry your hands.

Terrible quality. Can't pull out of the dispenser without tearing in half.

The count is less and the towel I have of a  thin quality. It does not absorb the water. Not good quality

In my opinion this is customer deception at its worst. Specifically, last summer I ordered #01840 ... very nice. Then I tried the recycled version ... cheaper but not as absorbent. Consequently, this summer I went back to #01840 ... and was shocked to find not only a grossly inferior (flimsy) product ... but a product that was worse than the recycled version. Any company who would change their product so drastically and not alert the customer by changing the Item # is a company that is acting with full intent to deceive. Absolutely No Conscience ... therefore ... not a friend to Humanity ...

Amazon was out of the Kleenex towels I usually receive thru my Subscribe and Save. These were suggested as a substitute. They are so horrible. They are really, really thin. It takes 4 or 5 to dry your hands. They also stick together as you are pulling them free to use them. I will never agree to these as a substitute again.

First ordered these and they were exactly the amount you’d get of the same brand in bulk at a wholesale club store, and the price was almost exactly the same. This was great and saved me a 30 min trip so I added them to my subscribe and save. When my first S&S order came it was with approximately half as many paper towels as my first order but the price was the same. Each ream was exactly half the height as before and the whole box was half as big as before. It feels so deceitful. Canceling this and finding another seller or heading back to the wholesale club.

Price increased a lot from 27 $ per box to 40+$. 3 pieces paper to dry hands which is almost as expensive as bounties paper towels. Bounties has way better quality . I will  try order one more time next month and check the price, if it’s expensive I’ll just buy bounties paper towels to dry hands and cancel subscription.

These paper towels are SO THIN I don’t know how anyone could expect them to be used for drying much of anything. I’ve been using the Kleenex paper towels for a few years and on my monthly subscription until they were out of stock this month so I had to try something else. I was wondering why these are so much cheaper than what I pay for Kleenex. I have to use 2-3 towels to get the same thickness I need, one towel is just too thin and not enough. I doubt I can return them since I’ve gone through two packs of them in less than a week.  I don’t recommend using this brand.

I brought this paper towel before and found out the size got smaller and thinner now. I was curious why the box get smaller until I opened it today. I compacted the product description with the previous order. Everything stayed the same, but the price has increased by more than double.

I have ordered these for 4 year and this last time they came thin, not true C fold and tear when you pull out of dispenser. Awful! I hope this is a one time issue or I will find another product. Our office does surgery and this is unacceptable

I purchased these for our kitchen because they were on sale. These are so thin it takes three to equal the thickness of our regular brand. We put a pack in our dispenser and tried them anyway. After wasting a half pack in one day, we donated the remaining 15 packs to our local food kitchen.We usually buy the Kleenex multifold paper towels (01890) for our dispenser. They are thick and absorbent, and one usually gets the job done for me. After donating the thin ones, I discovered these were on sale!Save your money! Don't buy this thin brand of Scott towels. Even on sale they aren't worth the money. Buy the Kleenex (01890).

First time I have tried Scott and I thought I will switch  to this highly rated paper towel . It was delivered today and I opened it with so much hope that it is a quality paper towel. Wow! How disappointing! I am definitely not going to subscribe and this will be the first and last I am going to use Scott hand towel. The photos attached shows everything I think about this paper towel. I am a long time user of marathon, multi fold paper towel, and I think I’d better stick with it.

I reordered what I thought would be the same product that I had ordered for years now. What I got was what is shown in the pictures!I’m thankful that I still had a couple of bundles from my last order to compare.Scott and Amazon: Why did you let me believe that I was ordering the exact same size that I have ALWAYS ordered?! I trusted you. SHAME ON YOU.ps. Now….on to search for new towels that will fit my towel holder (designed for the original-sized towels).

I would be embarrassed to have these out for guests.  Shocking that Scott would put their name on these.

Although the price was good these towels are as efficient as using toilet tissue.

Not worth the money. towels tear when pulled from towel dispenser. Do not recommend.

I buy these for my preschool.  Last year they were great!  This new batch is plain awful!  Of course, just like every other manufacturer, Scott changes the product for the worst but charges the same!  Not cool!  They need to at least change the photo here to show that the package is half this size!  Extremely misleading when we think we’re getting the same product/quality!  These are going back!  Will never buy again!  Way to lose a customer Scott!

This was a complete scam. I decided to try these out and I compared them to the other towels I normally use and this pack only had 150 towels where the box and the ad says 250 towels. It says that it is a total of 4000 towels and it is only a total of 2400 towels. They are still almost half the price of the towels I was using before, so it is still a good deal but complete false advertising.

Takes 3 towels at a time to dry your hands, poor quality.  Not a good value for the money

The size was good for what I needed but these are so thin they rip super easily I can’t even get them out of the container without them ripping and it’s annoying

These paper towels are very THIN! Poor quality You need a few to even wipe up a small spill

I tried both # 01840 and # 01804. the # 01804 is thick and # 01840 is thin.

They've changed. The quantity is less, and the price is more. They were great while they lasted.

I was really disappointed when I receive the box of Scott Multifold Paper Towels, way too thin! Need 3-4 to dry your hands.  We use Scott MF towels at work so I thought Id switch from my regular brand hoping it was the nice Scott multifold towels we order at work.  Nope, sadly as thin as a rough cheap tissue.  I wont send back but I will never buy them again. I need to use so many to wipe up small spills. Unless you get a box of these for $10-$12, save your money.

I thought I would try a different brand my original one is getting to expensive. I would NEVER buy this product again, besides how thin they are, they don’t separate when trying to get them out of the dispenser. Each time you pull one out you get 5 more and they rip every single time.  I’m goin back to my more expensive brand, at least I know what I’m getting. I just don’t know what I am goin to do with this entire box of cheap paper towels.

I ordered these once before and they were great, so I placed another order. The new ones are smaller than the previous ones and much less absorbent. The do not separate easily so you can pick them up easily. You also need to use 2 or 3 to dry your hands. These are so much more inferior to the previous box. I will not order them again since they changed the quality of them.

Hands Wet?  I have to use 2 or more to get them dry. l tried to pull one from the dispenser with a wet hand and most time it tore and left the towel in the dispenser. Ridiculosly thin for calling it a towel.

These paper towels cost has increased, and now they give half of the products amount. Before I ordered and these paper towels use to be able to refill twice for my dispenser. Now only one and the product is thinner and not as absorbent as before. Will not buy again...don't like shady businesses

I wrote a review a while back praising Scott towels I liked the thickness and quality, only took one towel to dry hands and could be used to clean my sink occasionally , great on spills etc..I have them on my subscribe and save ,I’m definitely not happy with the product I’m receiving now , I paid extra money to get a better quality product but what I have received is thin trash  I won’t continue to pay extra for , the Scott name is on the rapper so I don’t think it’s a knock off , I’m definitely disappointed and will be looking for a better quality product , most everything has went up in price and down in quality the past few years , very sad 😢

During the pandemic, because of the shortage of paper products, I started using cloth napkins (still do)…and these towels for around the house. I have never bought this brand before…always used Georgia Pacific. I was happy with them, but like everything else, they got pricey. So I thought I’d try these.You (kinda?) get what you pay for.Very disappointing. If you are using these in your business’ bathroom, you will find people will go through *a lot* of them. If I use them to dry my hands while working outside or with tools in the garage, it takes three (3) of these when I only used one (1) of the Georgia Pacific brand. A lot of waste. And not durable at all; once wet, they fall apart. I use them for a spill cleanup, or to wipe down my bird’s perch, for example. Again…it takes three towels where I only used one before.Don’t waste your money. Georgia Pacific is the way to go, at least if you are using them as I do.

I bought these because the price was better than the usual Kleenex Multifold towels I usually buy. They are so thin I need to use at least 2 to dry my hands, so will use them up twice as fast. Not a cost saving, obviously. Will go back to the Kleenex ones next time.

Although this is a company preferred item - they are not as absorbent as the ones we have ordered in the past.

These paper towels are a great value for the cost and quantity. The quality of the paper towels is poor. The paper towels are thin, you will need multiple towels to absorb and thing wet (especially drying off your hands). The towels are difficult to pull a part because they are very thin and they cling together. If you are a person who does not require absorbent paper towels you would be satisfied with this product.

Paper towels are very thin unlike the ones we purchase from COSTCO by the same company. They feel cheap and you need 3 to do the job of one. Will not buy again.

There very thin I feel like you also changed the size not happy with your paper towels. I'll try kleenex brand next time

So small in person, picture makes it look like theirs so much in one wrap

I did purchase for a few yrs. Had a case come out every 2 months. I did notice box were smaller and packaging was also, but the price was still the same. I thought maybe it was just me, but I did see that someone else noticed too. Been getting ripped off for about a year now.Will no longer be buying this anymore. Hopefully, this will not effect other products.

I was greatly disappointed with the quality of these paper towels.  I've been buying them for a couple of years now and I can see the extreme difference in these since I first started buying them.  They  used to be somewhat thick but now are tissue paper thin.  What used to take two or three to wipe up a spill now takes six or seven.  Had I known these were going to be as thin and as cheap feeling as they are I would have bought a much cheaper brand and saved some money.  Needless to say, I will not be buying this brand anymore.  I am also perplexed with the high cost.  Thank you America for continuing to scam the customer by offering cheap quality goods for more money.  Enough is enough!

Compare to before inflation this has lost its thickness. you have to get 3 tissues to dry your hands.

trying to pull one out with wet hands just leaves a part of the towel in your hand

I initially ordered the product and everything was great. Come time for subscription refill and it was not the same product. The towels feel more stiff and while the count is the same, it does not feel the quantity is the same. Perhaps it is due to the quality and they are not as thick and absorbent as the original. I turned off my subscription and will not order this product again.

Bought for the price which was a mistake.  We teach our preschool students to be friends to the Earth and take just one towel.  One of these towels does very little to dry hands of any size.  The towels rip coming out of the dispenser, and they are almost crunchy.  I will not be buying these again.

I purchased these paper towels because the normal ones I buy from Sam's were out of stock. These are no where near as thick. They are so thin my students have to use several to wash their hands vs. the 1 from Sam's. Will not buy again.

These are very thin and don’t absorb a large amount of liquid. We’ve used other brands where one towel would be sufficient for a small mess, where these you need at minimum three towels for the same mess. Won’t purchase again.

I used to use kleenex brand of paper towels.  Accidentally bought this brand.  It is very thin and not as absorbant.  I need two pieces of this one to do the job normally only need one Kleenex.

These feel half as thick as they used to be. Whatever they did differently, they need to undo. I won't be buying these again. The 2 stars are for the new box it comes in now

I purchased these Scott Multifold Paper Towels (01840), 4000 sheets for $34.99 to replace the towels I had been using, Kleenex Multifold Paper Towels (01890), 2400 sheets for $40.13.  I thought the Scott towels would be wider/deeper(?) with a folded width greater than 3 1/8".  (It is hard to find this specification when shopping for paper towels).Scott (01840) and Kleenex (01890) are EXACTLY the same width/depth and length, folded or unfolded.They differ in thickness only.  The Scott towels are much thinner. This makes them softer, but you will need 2 towels to dry your hands after a good scrubbing.I needed a multifold paper towel to fit in my TrippNT plexiglass dispensers which could fit a towel that is 3 3/4" x 10 1/2" (folded).

I purchased these because the price was cheaper then the Kleenez ones that I normally order. Not to mention there was more in this box. For example the Kleenex box is 7 pounds and this box was 14 pounds.I opened the box just before my quest arrived, but did not use any of them. Once I finally used them. I was very disappointed at how thin and cheap feeling they were. My garbage in my bathroom filled up pretty fast, because you needed to use more to dry your hands. I was going to deal with it, but then I was really annoyed with how thin they were, so I did a return. Now I'm patiently waiting for my Kleenex order to arrive.I will continue to purchase Kleenex from now on.

Great paper towels with constant price increases.

We have been getting these or a while and the with last case we got, they changed, dramatically. Not the same weight or fold and now these are shredding apart as they are pulled out of the dispensers. I was buying these because they were better quality and you could feel the difference. Now they are just bargain hand towels that don't stand up well.

The product listing says”same great towel, same number of towels just smaller case for easier storage. I beg to differ.. I still have product on hand from last purchase.. there’s no comparison between the old pack and the packs I received!The pack is half the size but shows as normal size on the website. It’s not that they are compressed more .. the older packs are rock hard the new one is squishy and the brown wrapping is baggy, as per photo.Not a happy camper!!!!

These towels are so thin and soft that the best use for them are as butt wipes in the woods.  Around the house you need 3 or 4 of these towels to just dry your hands off.  Yes, they are soft and absorbent but that the only good things to say about them.  Next time I'll look for thick towels for more universal use.

I had great hopes for these but unfortunate they are very thin. They are soft but when  You go to pull one out and right when your wet hand touches it, it rips.I also have to use 2 to 3 of them just to get my hands dry.

This weighs 16 lb for a case. Other brands for about the same amount of money unbleached weigh 22 lb for a case.I didn't realize these were bleached. They have a little bit of an odor and I'm not particularly happy with them. I have had ToRX unbleached which I'd liked very much.Also this item is unreturnable. That was kind of a surpriseI ended up shopping at another location, getting the 22 lb case of unbleached, paying about $24 and getting free shipping. I will never order these again and I probably will never order paper towels from Amazon again.

I usually get a different brand, but seeing how cheaper this brand was, I took a chance. It is much thinner than the other brand, and I actually need two of these to equal the absorption power of just one of the other ones.Will not purchase again. 😕

I've ordered these for a while for the bathroom at the office.  Always liked the quality and the singly-ply thickness was adequate.  Not any more.The most recent package was much smaller and  the towels are much thinner. Now I'm using two towels after I wash your hand whereas before I needed only one.Bummer.  I really liked the old version.  I'll be switching to Marathon brand from Sams Club.

These towels are very thin compared to the Pacific Blue brand we normally buy. It takes at least two, usually three, to dry your hands. They also don't seem to separate as easily but that might be because they are so thin.Amazon offered these as an alternative because our usual brand was sold out.I bought the "essential" version of these - in other words, you will essentially need more two to dry your hands. Check out other options.

Basically I need to use 5-6 sheets to dry my hands. Far too thin for my needs. When they get wet, they tear very easily. Once these are gone, I will try another brand. Bought since I thought they'd be good value, but I should have paid more for another brand.

Well, I thought I would be able to not have to haul the boxes from a local Seattle based warehouse store….I was wrong. For the same price I’m back to the warehouse where the quality is so much better. Thicker. More absorbant than these sheer thin towels which look like they will fall apart just by looking hard at them.

These are much smaller and way thinner than the Kleenex brand I have been using. I opted for these because the Kleenex brand raised the price so high but I guess the saying you get what you pay for is really true. I won't buy these again they are much smaller and thinner although the description on both say they are the same measurements.

These towels are not strong or absorbent. You have to use at least 2 towels at a time in order for them to be useful, so you're really getting half the # of uses. I will not be buying these again.

I have purchased Genuine Joe paper towels for years.  With the price increase and now shipping charges, I decided to try the Scott towels.  It takes 2 Scott towels for every one of Genuine Joe.  Will not purchase these again.

The amount, box size and texture is less and so thin. Major difference and really dissatisfied.

As soon as these get wet, the whole towel gets wet, and your hands are still wet. They don't absorb well, and seem to slightly disintegrate when they get wet. I feel like I am using twice as many paper towels to dry my hands.

My mistake. I didn’t realize there was more than one size and texture of paper towel.These are narrower and less absorbent. Next time I’ll be more careful.

When I opened the box and pulled out the packs three opened and went everywhere. Poor quality wrapping? Sure seems that way to me. They are okay once I got them all back together and repacked them properly. They are not as absorbent as the C fold I usually order. Won't try this again.

We use paper towels in our bathrooms because...kids!! I typically buy Pacific Blue but decided to try these because they were less expensive.  There are awful.  It takes 2-3 paper towels to dry your hands properly.  I'll stick to Pacific Blue.  They might cost a bit more but at least you only need 1 to dry your hands.

I have bought these several times. This is the second time I have gotten these smaller stacks. I buy 0184004 and its always been the larger stack up until recently. Shopping another supplier that will deliver what they promote. As far as absorption, its great, just quantity is not what it says.

Depending on how much you pay, it might be worth the money. I got some from Amazon Warehouse at big discount but I definitely won't pay regular price for this. Compared with the version I bought a few months ago, the size shrinks by a third and the thickness is 50% of the old version.

I had been buying boxes of Scott multifold and C fold towels for my church for years.  They were sturdy and fit our dispensers. However like other products (toilet paper!!) the Scott brand seems to be attached to tissue like cheaper products these days.  These towels were smaller, thinner and more tissue like than our prior Scott purchases.  While they do work for drying hands, I would not recommend  and will look for a more robust item for our next towel purchase.

I think the paper towels are way to thin.

These are so thin. I'm guessing that is why you get 4000 of them for one order. You will need at least 3 to dry your hands. The reviews that say they are absorbent are for another box because these aren't doing anything. 15 packs to go lol

These are the thinnest paper towels Ever!! I purchase these before and they were good but these are the worst. I’ll Never order again. I’ll go back to the other brand.

Sorry to say I would not buy these again. They are so thin I have to use at least 3 of them to be as absorbent as 1 of the other kind I was using before buying these.

You'll need 2 for any small clean up job, including drying your hands. I wasn't able to afford the others I buy bc the price nearly doubled. These are super thin. Not a good purchase. Wish I hadn't purchased it.

These are super cheap and thin, I have to use so many just to clean up a mess when it’s not necessary.

I waited too long to return these thinking that they would be sufficient. They are really thin. We use two towels to get our hands dry. I will not be purchasing them again and going back to our tried and true product that we have used for years, the Kleenex brand.

If you are looking for tri fold towels that are absorbent these are not for you.  They work great for a napkin but if you are looking for a towel to wipe wet hands this would not be your choice without using 2-3 at time.  I do have them in my vehicle and they do work good to wipe you hands after pumping gas etc.

Nothing wrong with these towels.  Price wise they are comparable... equal weights of paper/to cost.  Actually, approx. 1.5 of these towels weigh and cost the same as 1 'good' quality, other brand towel.  But, they are substandard, in that we, (America) does not really accept this thin of a towel.  These are larger than, but only as useful as a kleenex facial  tissue.  ie, you can't blow your nose with one of these, gotta double em up.  Not complaining, just don't know what application works for this thin of a 'towel', maybe for kids messes........

I purchased Scott towels previously (I believe they were the same item) but found these to be much thinner and less sturdy.

They do not have any heft so when customers are pulling them out with damp hands they tend to fall apart. Multiple complaints from customers. I did try myself pulling with wet and dry hands. With dry hands they pull out fine every time. It is just when using wet hands because they fall apart. Also adds to cleaning the floor popper towel remnants.

They are a little to thin for my liking I have to use 2 paper towels to dry my hands but they are perfect for the kids though

I was glad to see they were less expensive than the other tri fold towels I have purchased in the past.  However, they were considerably less absorbant and  thus required the use of more individual towels.  This ended up actually making them MORE expensive than any of the other towels we have used.  They also were folded less uniformly causing numerous pulls bringing several towels to be released at once.

Sgl. Ply does a poor job of absorbing liquids.  More C-Fold towels needed to wipe up spills compared to a 2 ply towel.If you need to wipe up spills, would not recommend.

Too soft, but price is good.

Thickness is about half of what it used to be. I reordered but definitely did not get the same quality, and got no price break.

Looked like a good deal, but they were really thin. I am using 50% more sheets for most tasks. I guess even a name brand towel like Scott is weak if it's one-ply. I'll buy the Amazon brand 2-ply next time for about the same price.

We ordered because of the number of good reviews. These are too thin and tear when you pull them from a wall dispenser. We end up with torn strips on the floor all the time.

thin.and tear so easy.scott mulfold

Works exactly like I expected a trifold paper towel to operate. They used to come in a 400 count witch was much more convenient for me. They now come in 250 count bundles.

I always use the Kleenex brand m-fold towels, but these Scott ones were on sale for less and the reviews were very positive so decided to try.  They are very different.  The Scott are smaller, they are thinner, and softer and maybe more absorbent.  However, they are a mess if you don't use the dispenser.  The Kleenex ones are thicker and bigger, and easy to grab a single piece even when just placed in a stack on the counter.  The Scott ones are so soft , if you try to take 1 piece, 5-10 pieces just come loose and it's a mess, so you must have a dispenser.  I am not a fan, and will go back to the Kleenex brand after these are used up.  Kleenex also looks and feels a lot higher quality...

I will go back to Kleenex brand z fold paper towels.  The Scott towels were very thin, almost like rough tissues.  I had to use two times more paper towels, as the Scott ones were so thin, you had to use two at a time.

I have bought these multiple times, the last shipment brought a significant change.  The individual paper towel is the same size, but it is significantly thinner.  Think of generic store brand TP, it's that thin.

hand drying in bathroom

We switched to this kind of paper towel when everything became scarce during COVID. I'd only bought the Kleenex ones up until I purchased a box of these a couple of months ago and I can't wait to get through them so I can buy the Kleenex ones again.The Scott ones are WAY softer, but that's the only advantage. They are thinner and weaker than the Kleenex ones and you end up using 2X as many to do the same job.I give them 3 stars because I love that there is no plastic in the packaging and I'd probably be totally cool with them of I didn't know about the Kleenex ones.

These towels were much softer than ones I have received in the past from subscribe and save. Although softer fewer towels per case, than previous orders of the same product.

I decided to save the extra few dollars and buy the Scott C fold paper towels instead of the Tork. I won't make that same mistake again. These are thin, and you need more to do what one C-fold Tork paper towel can do. I do not receive compensation for reviews.

i have been ordering this item for months now, but the last one i received was noticeably smaller in both size and weight.  the inner packs appear to contain 2/3 the towels of previous shipments, and i have noticed the dimensions of an unfolded towel appear slightly smaller as well.  a chat with amazon only resulted in a credit, as no one is able to confirm my suspicion.overall still a good value, but just another example of (poorly) hidden inflation: usually either cost goes up -or- item shrinks, but in this case both happened.

Too flimsy.  You need 3 or more to dry your hands.  They are soft but not very absorbant.

It takes twice as many as other stiffer towels I've purchased.  They are softer.

I’ve ordered these several times & never had an issue. I suspect problems of thinness and holes is due to manufacturer reducing amount of raw material to keep costs down. This also causes them to stick to each other so when you pull one, you pull 2 or 3 (shown.)

I usually get my tri-fold paper towels from costco but I saw these and thought it was a better deal because of towel count. They work fine but are really thin and not as absorbent as the ones from costco.

The price went up but the quality went down. They used to be absorbent but now they just push the mess around

Church kitchen and bathrooms - disappointed that towels were very thin so needed more to dry hands.

Absorbent, rough paper towels.  They work

I purchased the Scott towels after using Kleenex trifold. Not the same at all. Way too thin. They tear easily. I went back to Kleenex as soon as the box was gone.

Towels tear too easily when dispensing. Very thin.

Is it me or did the Scott Multifold paper towels get cut in half!! This is definitely not what I've been buying. Normally, the holder shown, would be filled to the top. That definitely isn't the case right now. What's going on!! Please explain!! The only reason I'm giving this a 3 rating is because this is not the normal size I've been purchasing and these are a staple in my home.

These paper towels are quite thin and don’t absorb enough for hand washing without using at least two or more towels. They’re pretty inexpensive, so I quest you get what you pay for. Next time we’ll pay a bit more for towels that do a better job drying.

These were substituted for our usual tri-fold paper towels  (Pacific Blue).  These towels are so thin that you need several just to dry your hands.  Its hard to pull these paper towels out of the wall dispenser without them ripping... frustrating to have little corners and bits and shreds of the paper towels litter the floor, especially since our janitorial service comes only once a week.

The paper towels are decent I say this because they have been cut down tremendously but there wasn't a cut in the price. They're much thinner than what they use to be. ☹️If the quality and quantity doesn't improve I'll be forced to seek out another company for my paper towels

These paper towel are super thin I bought because my regular ones weren’t available.  I won’t purchase again for comparison the Kleenex brand I only needed one towel to dry my hands with there you need 2-3 towels.

I have been ordering this product for a couple of years; however, the last box received, the packaging was different. Each individual package was 2 inches smaller. It still states that each package contains 4000 sheets. I obviously did NOT count them, but I find it difficult to believe that this is just tighter packaging, as the packs are already extremely compacted. I submitted a question, but have not received a response. Shrinkflation?

Been ordering these for years for work and they're fine. But the most recent cases were significantly smaller than usual, so I knew they had changed thickness or size, and I think it's both. Just small enough they don't work in the dispenser - when you pull a sheet, several fall out on the floor. Not a good change Scott!!

We usually get the Scott Slim Fold (5 fold] papers towels. They are excellent. Since they were unavailable we picked these paper towels from Scott. Big disappointment. Very thin, awkward to handle, and definitely not absorbent. Takes at least two towels to dry hands or anything else. Sort of OK for cleaning a dish or small counter spill. Do not recommend.

Does the job for the price

There seems to be less towels per package or else thinner.  These packages are  about 2/3 the size of all of the others we ordered several times in the past with the same product number.

Very thin, requires 2-3 to dry hands.

They're ok. But pretty thin causing you to use more.

These are fine for the money.  They are just thinner than expected so you end up needing two to dry your hands.

They don't feed from the dispenser consistently.  They're thinner than they used to be, but adequate for light wipe ups.

These paper towels aren't very thick and are a bit rough.  They work OK. Better ones will cost more, though.

Not the worst but not the best, either. I have to use 2-3 to get my hands dry. They also tend to clump together so we waste a lot more.

The quality was nice but I needed to use two sheets every time I wiped my hands. The sheets are way too thin.

These fit in my hollow shelf bathroom dispenser. But they are too thin. I will get thicker ones next time.

Very thin and rip easily.

They're pretty thin, need to use a couple to dry your hands, but they're cheap and they work for our work place.. definitely not a luxurious feel, but standard.

These hand towels are ok. I don’t feel they were super absorbent. You have to use a lot of them to clean up a mess or even just to dry your hands. They are soft though.

Love this version of a tri-fold paper towel.  Rated only four stars as they are a little thinner than other options I've tried an tend to stick together so rather than being able grab one, you usually end up with two or three.

A must have & No bad smell.  Quality just okay though doesn’t absorbs well enough.  Still a great help & been ordering this for years.

High price

For what I need the product , works very well, they are thin, but as long as you shake off the excess water off your hands before you grab the paper towel, it's perfect for just drying your hands, and then tossing the paper towel away, if you want the paper towel for washing a dish or wiping down counters this isn't it. I have other paper towels in my cabinet that I use occasionally when I need, a thicker paper towel for a more difficult job. I have a lot of company over and they're constantly grabbing paper towel to dry their hands and throwing it away so for that it works beautifully. . Scott offers, thin, medium and thick paper towels. I got the thin ones.

The towels don’t come out like I hoped. They come out good and then a bunch fall out.

They were too thin.

Much more cost effective than paper towels. You get 4,000 sheets per case for less than $40 when on sale.Paper towels average .02-.04 cp sheet.  These are less than .01 cp sheet.  Not quite as absorbent as some paper towels but not bad. You will need only one sheet in most cases. Unless your like me that spills the whole 1/2 gallon of milk....another reason why I use these.....

Not what we expected. Very soft but lightweight not heavy duty. More like a sturdy Kleenex.  Turns out husband uses for Kleenex

Like the way they feel and how much they absorb.

Product is fine. What we are not pleased about is the box was left on our mailbox. It should have been delivered up the long drive and placed by our front door.

I was concerned after reading reviews and receiving the product that it had changed. I went ahead and did the dumb thing and counted and I did in fact receive 250/pack even though the packaging is much much smaller. It does feel like I've gone through them much faster (we use them in academic teaching labs). I'm glad that shrinkflation just meant the packaging with this one since I've bee buying these for 6 years now and didn't feel like finding a similar product at a reasonable cost.

I was reluctant to order these papertowels after reading all the BAD reviews people were giving. I kept coming back to them, thinking  Scott brand cannot be THAT bad!! So I took a chance, & ordered them. I was pretty surprised how nice they actually are. No, they're not the thickest towel, but they DO do the job, & they're actually darn soft. Softer than some ive ordered, & paid MORE for!! I was very satisfied with them. packaging was nice, no ripped packets, and each bundle is tightly bound. I will order again, as they are cheaper than the brand i was getting.....& am just satisfied with these as the other ones.Glad I did try, & looked BEYOND the bad reviews!! Sometimes I think people are just too darn picky, & tend to find fault in anything, even tho its satisfactory!! Im telling ya........DONT BE AFRAID TO ORDER THESE!! They are great!!

We've been using these paper towels at my church for over a year now.  The most recent box was much smaller than before and the packages inside the box are about half the size they were before.  In the photo the old package is on the right and the new one on the left.  I weighed the packages, thinking maybe they were just more compressed, but the new packages weighed over an ounce less than the old ones.  I haven't opened a package yet to see if the towels themselves are different, but with the weight difference I suspect they are thinner.  Not happy to be paying the same amount but receiving less for the money.

I buy these regularly for my business.  Good value for the money and absorbent.

We use these tri-fold paper towels in a Plussen dispenser in our restaurant so we go through about a case every 3 weeks.  I compared their strength and absorbency to the Cintas/Unifirst/Prudential paper towels on automatic dispenser rolls. The paper was comparable, but much cheaper than the big company services.  Still, the paper will tear easily with a wet, one-handed pull. I tend to use both hands to pull down the towels to keep them from tearing.

I love tri fold towels to use in my bathrooms.  Provides good sanitary option for drying hands.  These towels are thin, but sturdy.  Great for cleaning too.  Two towels provide good absorbency.  Good value, large box.

Much more affordable than GP product and much softer. I usually have to use 2 sheets though, so it ends up being the same in the end. Good for home use, would not choose for office/public if you like to save on garbage space and wastefulness.

My first purchase so I might try a bigger size next time. But for the money I can't really complain. My wife yanks out 8 of them anyway. So spending extra money for larger towels may not be the way to go.

They are great for multiple uses.From drying of hands or cleaning up spills . They fit the need for collecting moisture no matter if it’s a natural or manufactured.

Just got this shipment, and it was the 4th time I ordered...the box was not only smaller,  it was much lighter. Not sure what has changed because the amount of towels is the same. Individual packs seem to be half the size. Seems like I ordered a miniature version. If I need to reorder sooner than in the past, I will definitely go with another brand..

These are decent quality and a good price. I buy these for my office and they are better and cheaper that the ones my cleaning service was supplying.

Need to grab two pcs in order to dry your hands.  Waist too many napkins.

Stick together, Waist towels.

Great price

These are some of the best paper towels I have purchased. I have bought others, but always come back to purchase these.

Too small for dispenser too thin of papet

Fairly thin towels although they do the job at a fair price.

I have two dispensers, one in kitchen and one in the bathroom. They are convenient, and do the job, I've reordered these several times.

Seem like a decent product the only downside is that it tore apart when you pulled it out of the dispenser .

A little on the thin side but works for single use.

Not as thick as I would like but served the purpose

I have bought Scott paper towels before and liked it very much. This time the paper towel seems not as absorbent as the one I bought before, but little softer.

I am still looking and trying different product until I find the right one. This was okay but not convinced yet

Water absorption is better. But it is harder! Overall, not bad

Discovered these during pandemic when couldn't get paper towels. I prefer these sheets. I place in a basket on the counter. Good product.

I like having disposable paper towels in the bathroom for my guests and myself. These tend to pull apart if you grab one from the dispenser with wet hands (you’re not going to need it if your hands are dry). I found that only filling the dispenser 1/2 way helps prevent this. I rarely get away using only one - for me it takes 2 of them to get my hands dry.

These have been great for our church bathrooms.

We'll most likely buy these again, but we use so much less it'll probably be in a year.

Great price! Not as thick as Genuine Joes. So I use more but they do the job!

Basic paper towels. Tenants appear to like em

They are a bit weak and "crispy", so they don't give a nice satisfying feel when drying your hands. And you need to be careful to hold both sides of the protruding towel and gently pull straight out in order to avoid tearing off piece by piece, especially when hands are wet.

These paper towels are surprisingly hard and rough to the touch. They are thick(er) and fairly absorbent. Two get up medium spills well. These are not dainty, they are rugged almost like shop paper towels. I don't know if you can put food on them. They are similar to the 'blue' workshop towels.

Better than paper towels

Yes, they work, but I have to use a lot of them for kitchen use. I think that they would be fine in a bathroom dispenser, which is what they are made for, not what I hoped to use them for. My bad.

Not as thick as I like.  I use this item in the bathroom

These are so much cheaper per pack than the rolls of paper towels and are available. I switched when I could not find the rolls and if your stores are still short on paper rolls, try these.

works fine, not sure if I'm able to write a long review on tissue paper, lol

Replaced hand towels in kitchen and bathroom with these to cut down on germs. Usually use 2 sheets for drying hands.

UPDATE: Very inconsistent. I purchased again and they are only 225 a pack. Not 250. They are much much smaller. So false advertising and they are cheating you. So do not purchase. They will be hearing from me. Update. Just saw they updated their photos on this product claiming they are the same amount. I just counted another one and it is 25 short per package. So they are lying. Attorney Generals office will be notified.I have been buying these for 10 yrs. They used to be thicker and more absorbing and easy to pull just one out. Now you pull them and they are all stuck together. It’s like every 3rd one that comes out has another 3 stuck to it. So you pull out so many when you only want one. And the packing around them (brown paper) used to be so tight it was almost spring loaded when you opened it. Now they are all mushy and falling out without even opening it. They feel more like Kleenex and fall apart when wet. They are awful. And I purchase the same ones. I just reorder the same thing every month. So they changed and made them cheap and worthless. Do better and try a different brand. Not amazon brand though. That brand makes little fine white dust particles everywhere. Makes a big mess.

They quality is paper thin. Awful. You’ll need to use like 3 instead of one because they’re much much thinner. If for home use and you don’t really care about quality, buy this. If for office or you prefer quality, avoid and do not buy.

Priced fairly. They work good in our dispenser.

We use these for both the sink and bathroom in our medical aesthetics practice and find them to be sturdy and absorbent.  They hold up from wiping hands to surfaces.  Will continue to buy.

ton of paper towels, will probably last about 6 months. Tissue is soft not rough on the touch

Recommend

Good quality

These towels are very handy for small clean-ups throughout the house.

We use them to dry hands after washing them in the bathroom, then dry off any water drops or spots on the counter top and faucet.

Product was great.Does a perfect job drying my hands and wet surfaces

There's nothing too special about this paper towel, but it is a little better than the kraft brown/recycled type. They're thin with some absorption ability causing me to use about 5 or 6 at a time to really get my hands dry. Cost comparison for quantity vs price made these the best choice in my opinion at the time of ordering.

These are so much better in the kitchen than regular rolls! We put up a nice wood dispenser and honestly it looks great, frees up counterspace, and helps us use less.  Because you only get one at a time from pulling down, you really only use as many as you need.  Then its so handy to have them on autoship so you don't ever run out.  These are just as good for in home personal use as they are for commercial use!

Our paper towel holders are a thinner size so the paper towel fit perfectly for them. They seem to last a good amount of time. People don't need to take multiple sheets because the absorbency is pretty good. These are the paper towels I always get for our bathrooms.

I really like these paper towels. You only need to use one.  I have them in my bathroom. I'll buy them again.

Scott is a known brand for a reason, they excel in durability, reliably standing up to wetness and pressure without tearing. Their absorbency is good, two is the perfect amount for drying your hands. While they may cost slightly more than generic brands, the towels are much softer and not as rough on the hands. Overall, Scott is reliable as per usual.

Great quality product for the price

The New Cases are half the size but the same price.  Each pack is half the size.  The case is half the size.  I bought a case of these paper towels over a year ago.  I was very happy with that purchase.  I just bought another case.  I feel Ripped Off!  Are we down to our last few trees?  Did the Big Wigs decide to double their Profits?

good ok

As described

I ended up buying these because I got tired of going to roll after a roll of paper towels and I wanted something that I can let everybody just grabbing use as much as they want without using my good paper towels but I keep put away they work perfectly for what I needed. It’s the same kind that you use when you go out and you pull them down out of here. There’s little boxes on the bathroom walls they seem industrially but for every single day use yes that way I didn’t have to keep going. I can tell you this much when I got the box I was shocked how much was actually in the package I gave several away and I’m still going through them. At the rate I’m going I’ll probably won’t have to buy any to January, so price wise very well worth it all I can say. Holy Toledo.

Not as soft as kitchen paper towel. But it is more economical. We have it in guest bathrooms. Seems more sanitary than reusing hand towels.

So strong and doable

These towels are soft and absorbent. For the price, they are very high quality.

Not the thickest but does the job for a very good price point.

Prefect for what is needed

Just be prepared for a huge box of these cause I wasnt.I thought it was worth the price for just ONE!This is for a literal box of multiples.I dont think I am ever going to get through all of this in my lifetime hahaha.

Good quality trifold paper towels.I definitely recommend. I also purchased the dispenser.

This box of paper towels lasts for months and is so easy to use compared to rolls-just pull one up and you have a perfect size sheet.

I have been really impressed with their performance. These towels are strong and absorbent, making them perfect for use in my office kitchen. They're also a great value for the price, as each pack contains a large number of towels.One thing that I particularly like about these towels is that they are multifold, which means that they can be easily dispensed from a towel dispenser. This is a huge convenience, as it means that I don't have to deal with trying to tear off individual towels or dealing with a bunch of loose towels that can easily become a mess.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Scott Essential Multifold Paper Towels to others. They are a reliable, cost-effective option for any business or office that needs high-quality paper towels.

We use an open top dispenser and these fit well.

I get these for my guest bathroom. They work well!

When I opened the box I was shocked at the size of the packages and checked my account to confirm I had ordered the same quantity as always. I had.Old package on the left, new on the right.Reading another review with a picture I too suspected these had changed quality.Comparing these with my last order, the towels seem to be the same.The smaller new package is definitely more compact...the other has a much more slack brown wrapping so it appears to me that less wrapping material with more compression would be the reason for the smaller size.I didn't count each towel nor did I weigh each package but  I'm satisfied with my purchase.

These towels are not the biggest but, work well. These dispense better than c-fold towels.

These are the best thing I have purchased it only makes sense you may wash your hands good and then dry them with a regular towel but especially if you have kids who wash ther hands for a few seconds after using the restroom and dry there not so clean hands with the same towel. For me especially when it is flue season I would rather dry my Hands with a paper towel and throw it in our recycling ben then dry my hands with a regular towel that everyone in your home uses. I even purchaes the dispenser so it looks good in my restroom

Just as good and cheaper than Bounty per sheet. "I'm in on that deal"

We have purchased this item multiple time multiple times for our hand towel machine. They fit perfectly and come out one at a time with ease.  They are not rough, but not as soft as a papertowel.  I would recommend these towels .

Perfect use for blowing your nose... this product you have to grab about five to six napkins to get your hands dried...

Best towels we have had so far.  Have tried several brands and this one is the best!

they are a good value and convenient

2020 when we were all staying home and no stores opened, I found these folded paper towels.  They are GREAT!  I use them to wipe up a small spill or as a napkin.  For two of us they have lasted two plus years and just ordered them again.  Worth the buy.

We use these for our corporate office restrooms. They fit well in the dispensers and because of the way they are positioned in the packaging upon delivery, they are hassle free to pull from the dispenser. Best of all, the bundle pricing for these paper towels is an unbeatable price for the quality you receive. Overall, I highly recommend to those needing a great quality paper towel at an affordable price.

I order these Scott towels all the time. Being a caregiver I use a lot of paper towels. These dry and wipe up messes. They do just that. They are thin and not so delicate but I repeat , they do dry and clean up messes. I love them!

I normally buy paper towels for daily use of drying of hands and spills. But sometimes it can be a nuisance constantly trying to tear of a piece or two with wet or soiled hands.  Then I discovered individual Scott brand paper towers. They are neatly stacked and have a "pop structure so we don't get that frustration of trying to tear off one paper towel. For my grand nieces and nephews Scott papers towels is a God send. Before they were tearing off too many, sometime bringing down the whole rack trying to get one paper. Scott towels are individual, and the flap pops up so there is no fumbling. They dry hands( that we are washing more than ever) efficiently so only one is needed. And it is great for spills. I love them and is one of my bi-monthly purchases. Its great for wiping up spills too.

Been using them for 8 years love them

I purchased paper towel dispensers, and you can dispense one at a time less much longer

I generally order the brown paper towels for our office bathrooms. They seemed to be cheaper but these were a better price. I decided to give these a try since they seemed to be a better value. I find them to be neater and softer than our usual brown paper towels. They definitely are not rough as the latter and they dry just as well, or maybe better. I also find that where I usually use more than one of the brown ones to dry off, one of the white will suffice.

Love these paper towels.  Have been buying them for years.  Instead of spending so much money on regular paper towels on the roll, I buy these. Definitely less costly.  They fit in a decorative basket on my kitchen counter.  They are sturdy n just the right size for drying wet hands and floor spills.  I have sensitive skin and these are not too rough to use a hundred times a day!!

These paper hand towels work great for workers. My towels were getting so dirty from shop workers. They’re also good for when you have a house full of guests so they don’t have to wipe their hands on a wet towel.

I use these towels in my workshop for by the sink for drying hands.

It’s cheap for the value you get from it. I’ve been using this since the pandemic and didn’t stop. I used to use Bounty but they are getting more and more smaller but pricier. Yes they are more absorbent but it’s such as waste using it once. Don’t think anyone would dry it and reuse. In comes this towel. It’s affordable and don’t feel bad using it once.

I disagree with using the description "absorbent" for these towels.  The towel was complelely wet when I tried to dry just one hand. To get both of my hands acceptably dry took 2 to 3 towels.  Nor are they soft. I had hoped these towels would be at least close to the quality of the Kleenex hand towels sold in the designer boxes. I'm very disappointed and have spent $43 on a product that doesn't work for me.

The last two shipments of Kleenex paper towels have been 1/2 the thickness of the previous shipments.What the heck happened?  These are so thin, they fall out of the paper towel dispenser in clumps of 6.Please tell me there is some mistake about this, and I will gladly change my rating, but don't start me out with a superior product, and cheapen it.

I used to be a loyal purchaser of Kleenex Multifold Hand Paper Towels due to their softness, absorbency, and affordability. Regrettably, recent changes have diminished my satisfaction. Not only has the price nearly doubled, making them much less economical, but the quality has also declined. The towels have become noticeably thinner, significantly reducing their effectiveness. This decline in quality, coupled with the price hike, has led me to switch back to traditional hand towels. Overall, I can no longer recommend this product as a cost-effective or high-quality option.

I decided to try these after reading positive reviews, and am not happy with the roughness of the paper.I was using the Kleenex Disposable Paper Hand Towels, 6 Boxes, 60 Tissues per Box (360 Total Tissues), and will be going back to those. Much (MUCH) softer.

These are stiff rough  and pretty useless .

Multiple reams of stained paper towels.  The price went up by $10 per box, I guess I’m paying for the nasty tie dye

I reordered the same product which used to have thick and luxurious paper towels. I received a box which said that it contained the same product, but contained thin and cheap paper towels.

These are rough and very cheap quality.

With Kleenex in its name and costing twice as much at an office products chain store, I thought this would be perfect for kitchen cleanups - absorbent and softer than other brands of multifold paper towels.They ain't.These towels are rough, stiff, and overly-absorbent...just a few drops of water and the towel turns into a wet mushy blob.  The "towels" are so stiff they appear to be at attention when pulled from my dispenser.Am going back to Pacific Blue, ASAP.Oh, and Kleenex appears to think flap-touching-flap packaging is optional.  The individual packs of "towels" are not completely wrapped...just banded with an overwrap and bundled into a box with top flaps at least least an inch apart.  The company made no attempt to keep ancillary dust/dirt from getting in.This only good part is that it took a serious bunch of "towels" to clean up a small spill from my cats' water dishes...so, I expect to have gone through all 2400 in a few months.  But, given their rough-to-the-touch, I will also be investing heavily in hand lotion.

This product is not absorbable wouldn't recommend and would not buy again wasted money

I have been ordering the same towels for years now and my last order is paper thin!  Where we could always use one paper towel to wipe hands, now we need 2 to absorb the water!  Not happy with this change.  I will be returning the one box that is unopened.

Please do not ship Kleenex brand for Tork substitute .They are horrible, this is second time with substitution.  They tear when taking from holder and come unfolded and are too heavy.  Please offer better substitution if out of Tork next time Thank you

I used to love these paper towels.  They were by far the best product for the price and I bought them on auto ship for years.  Not anymore.  The price of these towels has almost doubled virtually overnight making them unaffordable. If the price comes down I will consider returning to purchasing them. Until then they are off of my shopping list.

I bought the Kleenex paper towels that were in the boxes but they were a expensive for the amount I went through them bc they came in a dispenser box like Kleenex.Then I found out they sell the same brand as a bulk item which seems perfect.These rowels are far rougher than the ones that the boxes come with. Why is that? They should be the same since they’re the same brand.They also tear almost every time I remove one from any of the 3 different kinds of dispensers I have

On our 3rd time ordering a case of these Tri-folds something bad must have happened either in the manufacturing process or in transit. All of the paper towels so far (about half way thru the box) have a very strong Sulphur smell  where the 2 cases before did not. They smell like a burned out campfire / the end of a fireworks show. Perhaps our package was salvaged from a transit accident or maybe they drove thru those California fires on the way to our place in Arizona. We really liked this product and know accidents happen so we may take one more chance before moving on to someone else but yikes, the most recent ones smell horrible.

Instead of the 16 pack I usually get for our office, they sent the 8 pack;  the towels were thinner and not good quality.

I was duped by five star reviews saying how soft they are, or were.  NOT SOFT! They are thick, but feel like card board. Cringe! This it the kind of towel you find in a dispenser in a highway bathroom or garage. The only thing good about them is they do fit in the Tork dispenser.Going back to my old standby, Tork #10-12-98.

Have they changed the count on the towels .  I used to have to press the stack down to put it in the dispenser, now I have at least a 1 inch space in the dispenser, so far 5 stacks out of 5 stacks are like that, I’m assuming the whole case is short like that, thought it was strange I was going through them to quick. Very disappointed!

Since paper towels on a roll are in short supply, I thought I would try these as they met the key criterion of being available, plus I figured they would be of good quality because it is a name brand.Under no other circumstances would I buy these again. They are not at all soft, are only somewhat absorbent, and basically just feel cheap. Yes, they are intended for restaurant bathroom use, but they are not even up to the quality of the ubiquitous brown paper towels you often see at highway rest stops. Good only if everything else is sold out.

Just opened my box to unpack and put in cabinet. Had to throw out 3 packs because they showed evidence of being wet and then he since dried. Something tinted slightly yellow. The other packs seemed fine and did not have an odor or appear to be impacted.

Bought these because you were out of Tork 578 hand towels.  The 578 is superior.  These Kleenex hand towels might be fine for a commercial restroom but not what you want in your own bathrooms for use.Kleenex towel is of low quality.  Sorry that I bought them.  I rate them to be low value even though they were not expensive.  You wind up using multiple towels to dry your hands.

We usually buy this item and it was great! Unfortunately the last item ordered did mention open package but did not say missing packs. We thought we were going to get 16 Packs but only received 14. Now I have to take this box to UPS to have it returned.

I don’t know if the odd smell came from shipping, storage or manufacturing, but when I use them to wipe my face it’s smells really odd! I can’t explain as it’s not a musty smell, more like Raid bug spray. I’m going to contact Seller to see if I can return the case.

The paper towels are very very rough😩

I have purchased these 4 times this year.  The first 3 times they were good.  However, this last time, the paper towels smell terrible.  They looked a little grayish in color and wrinkly and when you open them up they just smell bad.  I had to stop using them because after washing my hands, they would smell worse after drying them with the paper towels, than before actually washing them.  I am very disappointed on this last purchase.

Really disappointed, thought if I spent a little more money that the Kleenex brand would be a bitsoft but these are just the same stiff and hard ones that I bought at Costco!!  Can't endure them willsend them back

The manufacturer's ad has statements like "ultra-soft premium Kleenex paper towels", a "high-end bathroom experience", and "Soft and absorbent"  They are like the sand paper!!.  They stick together, making them difficult to dispense.  and they are absorbent, but not Highly Absorbent.  I bought Kleenex brand because I thought they would be up to the same standard as their Facial Tissues.  They are not.  I'll use up what I have purchased and then search for another brand.  Keep away from your face and little children.

01890,  This was recommended to use with Kleenex 51904 which measures 8 1/8 from left to right inside. 01890, They are to long!! Measures 9 1/4 ,  I had to bind them in the middleTo get in the holder.  Can not fill up due to the bow in the towel And I have a case of them.Can you tell me what will fit you Kleenex 51904.

These paper towels are awful. The Kleenex brand you buy in store in individual boxes are soft and strong. These things are rough and tear apart after wet from drying hands. They are just as bad if not worse than the big commercial rolls of paper towels you find in restrooms at the store. Even at the low price they are not it. Definitely wouldn’t recommend buying.

when I started buying these paper towels they were great. I only needed one to dry my hands.Now drying my hands takes 2-3, seriously, no longer worth the money.

These towels are nothing like what you get in the small box at the grocery store...they are very rough and I will NOT use them as intended for guest hand towels in the bathroom. Would be embarrassed to put out for company and I wouldn’t even use for just us! Very disappointed in the quality! Going to be donating and looking for better softer quality towels.

Has the softness of wet cardboard. Unfortunately I bought a case of this garbage. If softness is your goal, avoid this product at all cost

This is the second time buying these paper towels. First time was great so I ordered them again but this box smells like fireworks when you dry your hands with them. Very strange.... I also checked the other reviews to see if other people had the same issue and I am not the only one.

The towels are what you expect for a towel dispenser but they STINK!!  They smell like a rotten dish cloth or egg.  My entire closet that is holding them stunk up within an hour of pulling them out of the box.

cheapest possible materials, from recycled paper. hard, rough, made with chemical processed recycled paper.

I’ve been purchasing this project for over a year and for the most part have been extremely satisfied.  However, with my most recent orders (4), there have been numerous packages within this box wherein the paper towels were severely damaged, torn, ripped and not usable in my dispenser.

Even in these days of paper towel scarcity, these are horrendous.  They are too unpleasantly rough to use.  I opened the big box, assessed the towels, and took my $30 purchase to the dumpster.  I bought them for home use, but why anyone would want to use this detritus at work escapes me.

I purchased these thinking that the Kleenex name would give me a softer paper towel and wow was I wrong!! They are so rough and scratchy, I might as well be using sand paper. I purchased these for my bathroom at the same time that I purchased Pacific Blue Select for my husband's shop dispenser and the Pacific Blue is so much softer than the Kleenex brand. Go figure.....

HORRIBLE! Worst paper towels EVER!  Stiff and scratchy. Nothing like the Kleenex hand towels I bought before. Don’t absorb when you use them to swab or mop up spills. I will NOT EVER buy them again! Newspaper is softer and more absorbent. Don’t use to clean eyeglasses - too scratchy!

The packs of towels were not sealed in plastic or paper. The ends of the packs had no covering at all & the top flaps of the outside cardboard box didn’t come together. During a pandemic it is even more important for them to be more protected from the elements.

I t came in a box so heavy I bruised my hand carrying the box .  I am an older woman living alone. 3 came in one huge box. and one came separately I need two labels.  I have no way of printing out.  and I am quarantined.

Why did you change this product so much that toilet paper it better

I was thinking that Kleenex would be a lot softer paper, but it’s rough and it’s cheap

This product has a smell to it.

The paper is too long , doesn’t fit into the holder

Much more difficult to use than many of the lesser expensive brands.  They don't unfold easily and are very tightly pressed.  When packed you can tell by the rigidity of the wrapped back that they are as hard as wood.

These towels do not come out of the dispenser ! They get stuck almost like they are coated with glue . Requires pulling hard to get them out and then they rip . Awful

These were advertised to fit the Kleenex dispenser. They did NOT fit! And now I have a bunch of paper towels I can’t use with the dispenser and obviously not an item you send back once opened.

Won’t fit my tork it rips off each time not good will use til gone but not happy won’t reorder.

This order was double of what i normally get, yet box is even smaller.  Unhappy customer

Let me start w/the positive..the value for money is great!Now for the negative...there is NOTHING soft  or absorbent about these napkins.I chose these due to the amount & description. But, as they saying goes you get what you pay for. The other brand although more expensive & less napkins...@ least they where actually soft & I only had to use ONE napkins to dry my hands after washing. With these I have to use TWO napkins to dry my hands. Sorry to say I will NOT be purchasing these again.

very rough and dry texture.  should have stuck with the Tork brand.  i'm stuck with an entire box full.  may see if i can find a place of business or someone to donate them to.  they're that bad.  would never purchase again.  disappointed in Kleenex brand.  **i initially rated with one star.  i increased to two stars because they are fairly absorbent.  still hate them, though.

What's the point of giving an option to send the item in amazon packaging when your packaging department ignores the request??? I have ordered this 23 times to date and the last two orders including this most recent one had the item sent as is (in manufacturer's packaging). I specified that it be sent hidden in Amazon packaging for medical reason.  This packaging has the end flaps untaped (with gaps in between) that dirt and germs can easily enter the box with towels inside. Very unhygienic! Five stars for the towels which I highly recommend for being so absorbent and strong (does not rip easily when wet), ONE STAR for the (un)packaging -- three stars overall.

The paper towels I received came in a very lovely wrapping, but they are course and not very absorbent. I was very disappointed by the quality that Kleenex has for this product.

Before buying these, please consider how you plan to use them and read the reviews with that in mind. They seem pretty similar to ones I’ve used in a commercial restroom. But if for home use, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. I bought these because the price for the Tork brand I love for our kitchen dispenser (Tork MB 578) and bathroom had been discontinued and the price skyrocketed. But after a few months, I’m ready to pay up for something better and put these in the garage! They’re so rough and spew so much paper dust that I dread pulling one from the dispenser, and they’re not a good alternative to regular paper towel given their stiffness and lower absorbency. So far two packs also had poor cuts on one end of the stack, adding a messy confetti experience to each pull from the dispenser. The bits were still too attached to pull off before placing in the dispenser but not attached enough to stay put when pulling out a sheet. Definitely not the quality I want folks to use after hand washing in the bathroom either, especially someday when we have actually have guests inside the house again …

This product is OK. It gets the job done, but… the color is off white, and they are not soft at all. I will definitely level up the next time I purchase.Addendum: NOT easy to use because they don’t dispense well without a dispenser. In other words, they stick together- requiring a two handed approach. This is very irksom as it leads to waste when I am in a hurry, or cannot use a two handed approach.

The Kleenex towels are not soft as advertised, feels rough against the skin.

These are nothing like the ones that are in the boxes of 60! These are not soft and not terribly absorbent!I thought I could put them in the empty boxes I had that had the 60 towels in....they barely fit and they are very rough to the touch compared to the soft ones in the individual boxes of 60!

I purchased a box of these Kleenex Multifold Paper Towels about a year ago because I was too lazy to go to the club store to buy a box of Marathon brand paper towels.  While these towels are absorbant, they are "interlocked" so that it is impossible to pull one towel out of a stack to dry your hands.  I like to keep a stack of these type of towels on the window ledge above my kitchen sink to use for a quick wipe down around the sink, to dry herbs that I've rinsed off, and to dry my hands.  But I also don't want to use two hands to separate them since I inevitably will get a whole stack of them wet.  And, I don't want to use the care necessary to delicately pick one towel off the stack.  Yes, first world problems. . .The only reason I am bothering to write a review of these towels is that I get tired of getting a reminder to "buy again" every couple of weeks.  Another note, these are not as large as the typical towels used in a towel dispenser. They are square instead of rectangular.  They do work in the towel dispenser I have in the garage, so if that is what you want to use these towels for, they are fine for that.  But just to have a stack of them in the kitchen or in a guest bath, as others have suggested?  Not so good.  The only reason I'm writing this review is that I got another monthly "buy again" nudge from Amazon, and the answer is "No.  Never again."

These paper towels may be many things but soft is not one of them. We bought a dispenser designed for these paper towels and they dispense OK if your hands are dry. But if your hands are wet (Hello... like you just washed them} the towels rip easily trying to get them from the dispenser. We Are disappointed and would never buy these again.

I made the mistake of taking the other reviews and running with it.  I was using the Kleenex hand towels that come already preboxed and I figured I would give these a shot because of all the good reviews.  Boy was I disappointing the minute I opened the box.  These are completely opposite of what I thought they would be.  I wasn't expecting the super soft cloth like material  that the boxed type are but I also wasn't expecting public restroom paper towel quality either. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP and so dang rough.  I was too embarrassed to us them in the guest restroom so I opened am using all my previously owned paper towels in the guest bathroom and the rest of my bathrooms get these ugly things.  I am so beyond dissapointed and can't wait to run out so I can buy other ones.  Don't be fooled with all the good reviews, this only 1 notch above the brown recycled public restroom paper towels.  The only reason they get 2 stars is because they are white and they do dry your hands.

While these are soft, they are not very durable. We have a spring loaded dispenser and these towels tear every time.I will be returning these and ordering a different brand.

Really really rough paper product NOTHING like the quality that comes in a single pack from the grocery.  Those towels were extremely soft and absorbent  I feel like Kimberly Clark corp.  is a fraud.

These paper towels have a high quality look and thickness, but I didn’t realize they were going to be as ribbed/rough as they are.  They are extremely difficult to pull out of our dispenser (pretty standard dispenser) due to the friction from them being so rough.  I have to use two hands to pull one out, and even then, the towel often tears and won’t come out whole.  I have made sure not to put the full capcity of towels in my dispenser to minimize their weight pressing down and creating more friction, but even still it is really difficult to pull them out.  I’m bummed that it will take my tiny office a LONG time to use up these towels so I can get regular ones that are easier to pull out.  I’m including a photo to get an idea of the texture.

The absorbency is great but that is all I can say good. They tear into pieces when trying to pull out of the dispenser. The dispenser and this towel were recommended to be used together, but I disagree completely! As an adult, I wiggle and jiggle the towel back and forth gently to get most of a towel to dispense, but I bought these for grandchildren ...not a good match. They will never be able to pull down a towel without it ripping apart.

I should have read all the reviews!  Some reviewers plain out lied about the softness of these paper towels. I would send these back but I wasted half a pack trying to get these towels to come out of the dispenser without breaking. I don't know what I will do with this big ole box of paper towels. I guess my husband could use them in his shop. I need to find some which are much softer but durable enough to pull out of the dispenser in one piece!

Do you remember those brown paper towels used throughout your time in public school, the kind that moved liquid around, rather than soak it up? Yeah, well, these paper towels might be ever so slightly better than those.

These were recommended to go with a dispenser, they do not come out easily. I find small pieces of them everywhere in the restroom. The biggest thing.... THEY STINK! Especially when they are wet. I thought the boys were peeing in the garbage can but the paper towels were what smelled. They get wet and have a funky pee smell. Its awful! They are pretty rough and don't absorb very well. Feels like your scratching your skin off before the water!

I'm very disappointed as to why they decided to make it about 2 inch smaller .And charge the same prices Even higher sometimes I will post a picture later .

These are relatively cheap but they are crap. They tear easily trying to get them out of the dispenser, and they are not soft or absorbent compared to many other paper towels. I notice that the price basically doubles on the better towels after your first order or two, but I guess I will go ahead and get ripped off and at least get towels that will dry your hands and won't tear every time you touch them. Not these, though. They aren't worth the savings.

Unfortunately I just found a small worm/larvae alive in the middle of one of the bundled napkin packs.  It had eaten some of the surrounding paper.  Now I’m scared there are more in the packs I stored in my pantry!  I agree with another reviewer who said these should have been sealed.

These arrived in box from manufacturer with large gaps on both sides. Don't really care for my paper towels bring exposed to the environment while they travel the country with carriers. They are paper towels - should be clean. I don't understand why that is so difficult to understand.

While it is absorbent and good value, the softness is not there! Stiffness is so prevalent they are just as likely to tear than come out with the ease you expect from Kleenex.I’ll explore other brands once these are gone

I found these towels terribly  rough and unpleasant.  They also were not packaged to auto-fit into the U-line dispenser I'd purchased them for, so there was always an inch or two of towels left to hold onto and store, and they did not pull well out of the dispenser.  I won't buy them again and was surprised that Kleenex made such a rough type of towel (I purchased Kleenex specifically because I thought they would be softer).

Just not what I have been used too

Material is a little too stiff and abrasive. May be good for wiping table and floors but too harsh for face.

Difficult to work with for bigger messes since you need to grab quite a few to get the job done and then the mess comes through and gets on you as well. I prefer regular paper towels on a roll.

lied, not soft at all

I spent the extra $$ for this shelf because I expected it would work better than the cheaper versions available. It is difficult to pull towels from the bottom, particularly when one's hands are wet. The towels tear too easily. I am using Kleenex 01890 Multi-Fold Paper Towels, 9 1/5 x 9 2/5 towels.

Very rough texture. Purchased for bathroom use but too embarrassed for guests to be using. Not a good hand towel. I use them mostly for cleaning up in the bathroom since I’m stuck with so many of them. Very disappointed, especially given the brand name.

Got these to use in my bathroom at home. With all the rave reviews I figured these would be quality towels. They are really rough. I was hoping for something like the texture and softness of the Viva roll papertowels. More cloth like. They seem to be absorbent and durable but they just don't feel good on my hands. They are better than the ones you might find in a public restroom but not much.

It is what it is.

I bought it for my salon bathroom.  I hate it.  I normally buy Scott Multi Fold.  Tried this one.  I will not reorder when it’s done.  It’s smaller & less absorbent.  Feels cheap!

We do get these on a regular basis for our business and general have no trouble.  We have opened the first 2 packs from the last carton and the glue from the wrapper seeped into the towels.  They are stuck together and cannot be used in the dispensers.  This item is not eligible to be returned.

These are too thin to really do much around the house. Not strong nor absorbent enough for pick ups or use in garage/kitchen area.

Thought that since it was kleenex brand it would be softer than what you would find in a public bathroom but they are not.

external shipping box no issue the inside box was ripped and exposed the clean tissue packs that were wet and mold smelling.

These are NOT “ultra soft” like advertised. They are rough and hard. Yes they’ll do fine for drying hands/counter top but so are sandpaper (j/k). I was hoping to be as soft as bounty paper rolls because I use them for drying both hands and face.

The towels have been changed.  They are very rough and barely absorbs moisture, would not buy again.

My day. Terrible! Dirty and wet! Like being left being left out in the rain to dry?

Package contained 15 sets of napkins instead of 16.

dissappointed because I bought  a ton of something and they suck

Rough like sandpaper. Not a good value. Cheap brands feel better to touch

Paper towel too hard

Love the idea of having these but they are way too thin

they tear when pulled out of the dispenser

I USE IT TO SUPLEMENT MY REG PAper towels.

Received only 15 of 16 packs

Absorbency bad

These towels are not very soft they area a little hard

It can be used in a great variety of  activities.

Checked to make sure it would fit, but these are too big

I bought a case of these, what I thought were most professional, soft and strong type, and two dispensers.  I’m a foster mom and I like that they’re easier for the kids and me to grab if they just need one, and they’re more hygienic than a cloth bathroom hand towel.  I was disappointed that they’re not softer and absorbent than your average paper towel, and actually a little rough.  They remind me of those brown colored paper towels that you find in a roll dispenser at public bathrooms (other than the color).  I went around and compared them to roll paper towels of other brands in my house (touching and testing each one for absorbance and softness) and even the cheapest rolls of paper I have are softer and more absorbent.  I’m still glad I tried the trifold towels and bought the dispensers, because they help the kids and me just grab one, and they are more hygienic and convenient, but after I work my way through the gigantic box of these, I’ll be looking for a different type/brand.  I wish they came in smaller amounts so that I wouldn’t have to store so many and use the entire case before I buy a different brand.  They work okay, but I expected more when the description of this specific type says that they’re premier for when you’re trying to impress guests.

These are much thicker than I thought they would be, but they've not very absorbent. I can use one to wipe a soaking wet surface and afterwards the surface is still pretty wet, requiring at least two more passes with dry ends to completely dry. I also folded one up into a square and poured some rubbing alcohol on it to clean a screen, but when I went to wipe most of the alcohol dribbled off, having barely been absorbed. The square was laying flat, and at least 30 seconds had passed between me pouring and picking it up to use it, so that shows how bad the absorption really is.These are meant to be used in a dispenser so this is on me rather than the product, but since they're Z-folded they're a pain if you're trying to use them without one. Pulling a single one up always brings more, and separating just one from the stack is a two-handed job.The shipping box is surprisingly heavy, while the individual bundles are surprisingly light. They feel like they weigh nothing, compared to their size.They do the job, and there are A LOT of towels in the box. But I probably won't be ordering this one again.

I starting using paper towels in the bathroom when COVID stormed it’s way into our lives to help reduce possible cross contamination etcBut the price on these just keep creeping up and the quality in my opinion is going down, I will probably shop around so I’d say these are so so - not great but maybe not the worse either

I thought these we’re going to be similar in quality to the disposable box of Kleenex hand towels.  These are lighter weight, and not as smooth. They will work, they are like what you would use in a public restroom but I thought the quality would be better.

I bought a Tork paper towel dispenser in February and a case of Viva hand towels;  I love those hand towels:  soft and absorbent with a great feel to them.  They no longer make the Viva pop ups so I’ve been trying to find a substitute.  Bottom line:  there is no substitute.  These are ok.  I’d say one step up above the really papery ones at the doctor’s office.  One will dry off my small hands, but it will be in a tiny ball by the time I’m done.  You’ll need two for bigger hands.  I contacted Viva about making theirs again; I’m so bummed I have to settle for these. I know this is a first world problem; but I liked living in a first world.

Received the tissue boxes shipped with a big gap in the bottom, they are tissues and should be clean, I don't understand why there is such a defective packaging, it's incomprehensible. Please improve greatly.

I hung a multifold paper towel dispenser in my house a couple months back to add more protetction during the Covid outbreak. The first case of towels I ordered were Genuine Joe GJO21100 and I was pretty happy with them.  As our supply was depleting, I was on the lookout for a good deal to get more towels. I got these Kleenex towels at 25% off by ordering 4 cases.  I figured it's Kleenex so it has to be good. Compared to the Genuine Joe, I am pretty disappointed. The texture is rougher and they are more rigid-feeling.  Even with the 25% discount, these were about the same price as the Genuine Joe towels.  I'm disappointed and now I have 4 cases to use up.

I was hoping for a soft feel. While these appear to be fairly absorbent they do not have the softness that a more expensive paper towel has.

These are not the soft towels you buy in the individual Kleenex box but more of a harsh papertowel. They'll due for throwing a wad of them at a mess. They are not like a bounty or sparkle towel. I actually think the scott paper towels are better. They are packaged in groups so will be easy to throw a stack in the car or whatever else you'd need them for. Are they going to be my favorite, no but I'd rather have these in the bathroom during covid than hand towels.

Towels are very rough therefore do not come out of my dispenser as easily as I would like

product was described as soft.  not soft, feels like tree bark.  expected a better product from a big name brand.

I used the ones that come in the package that u can put on the regular towel hanger and loved it. I thought these would be of the same quality but they are 10 times below that quality. These are course, but they do dry your hands. It's more sanitary than the paper towel rolls as many people tend to hold the rest of the roll when tearing off one, so they are suitable for my guest bathroom, when used in one of the dispenser. I bought the tork mini dispenser. If I knew it was this rough I probably would have just gone with the prepackaged single use containers. Im still debating whether to return them as I'm not completely pleased with it.

My husband said don’t by expensive paper towels. Then my husband and adult son said please don’t ever buy them again. We want round rolls. I said but, it’s like a woman’s bathroom at a restaurant or place for women. They said nope. Lol

I bought these because of the current paper product shortage and because of the Kleenex brand, but I was really disappointed. These paper towels are very stiff and not very absorbent. You will need at least 4 or 5 to get your hands dry. I have used this kind of paper towel in store restrooms and they were better and softer. No, I did not return these paper towels, but I would not order them again

smaller, and more expensive, but good quality

these are great except the fact you can NOT put them in your microwave. As usual when I warm up a plate of food I cover my plate with paper towel, well today I did just that except it CAUGHT ON FIRE within a matter of 2 seconds!!!!! it was literally into flames!!! Idk what is in the paper towel but whatever you do, do not put into the microwave.

This is how my package arrived I’m so mad

Supposed to be soft and absorbent but not that great on either count. I bought to put in an empty box of the very nice Kleenex towels since there was/is a shortage of those at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown. I use them in our "puppy room" bathroom. They work but not that absorbent. Would not buy again.

Thin and not very absorbent.  They are ok for a quick hand wipe or small spills

Seeing reviews say they were the plushiest, softest, and luxurious towels, I was expecting a lot. Unfortunately they were rough and mediocre. I honestly was expecting those super soft thick towels that you find at expensive restaurants and hotels. I wish I knew which ones they were. You literally could wipe your face and tooshie with those but these are rough. Its no big deal because I plan to use them more to clean up counters, mirrors, and faucets.The other reviews I read just threw me off a bit.

Ok I thought these would be soft and nicer but they are pretty basic run of the mil elementary school type hand towels - now I have a crap ton big box of these things! LolIf it was just for my kids I wouldn’t care but I wanted them for my guest bathroom due to Covid-19 trying to make fewer touch points

dislike:  would have liked a slightly larger towelliked:  the towel material was strong and also had a nice feel

There are good features and poor ones with this product. The imprint design is helpful but the thickness is not. Compared to other brands, the thinness requires using more than one sheet at a time which is not economical. I tried this product because of the Kleenex name but cannot recommend it for above reason.

I really liked these paper towels at first because they are nice and thick  and absorbent. However, once they get wet they have a really bad smell to them. Will be switching back to our old brand.

Ordered these for the aesthetic but they’re not absorbent. I’ll usually keep these in home for guests and use hand towels.

Outside box is intact expect inside. its so unexpected

They're  ok. I need them for the restroom so that family and guests can dry hands.

I would not buy this product again. Kleenex is usually great not these. I wanted higher quality and softness.  Not a good deal. Did not return but should have. Very disappointing.

I paid extra for these towels thinking they would be soft. They are not. Other better and cheaper brands are out there.

They get the job done. Not soft as others have noted. I use in guest bathroom. I purchased a generic plastic tray for $8 to hold towels. The countertop dispensers were too pricey.

Not very soft but ok. Just way too small for my use

Great towel but the length of the towel is great 11"; the width, I needed to be 11" as well; but it is 7.5" not long enough for my dispenser.

I have ordered four different brands of C-fold towels, but our customer's consumption rate of this brand is at least 2x what the next brand would be. We go through way too many of these to buy again.

If your looking for softness, absorbency  this is not for you.  For drying your hands after constantly washing hands all day long this paper towel does the job

These towels are very nice but I thought they were a refill for my Kleenex dispenser. I was disappointed they were to big to fit.

The best of the worst hand towels

Smaller than you'd expect.  Shorter in length when folded.  I guess it saves them money.  I've had these before.  I tried to avoid getting them again, but got them unintentionally.  Still haven't found the Holy Grail of paper towels yet.

They're paper towels sold for commercial use. We decided to use them for flu and virus instead of towels. Can't really complain. They were as expected. Decent price.

It was delivered quickly but it's the wrong size, I needed the smaller size paper towels, I can't use them in my paper towels holder.

I should have paid more attention when I ordered! Gave them to the Food Bank.

They were ok but very stiff not soft at all

I purchased this product looking for more absorbency and softness.  This is a thicker paper towel but it is also very stiff and not soft at all.Wish they sold the same type in the single home use boxes in this bulk quantity.

Smaller and thinner than the other brand I purchased previously. Will not buy again, returning to old brand.

Very rough on hands, Was too hard. With the quantity purchased it's going to take a very long time to replace.

Thin towels so they rip coming out of the dispencer

Wasn't as soft as I expected.. but thick and ok.

Lower rating due to being your standard gas station trifold.  I was expecting softer due to the description.

Not sure exactly what I was expecting when used to Bounty and Viva.  But instead of a specific grade of Scott that was recommenced as the strongest and best to use as a cleanup towel in a shop.  Which also came in 4,000 sheets for just over $30.00 I bought these.Yes, purchased them specifically because all the haters of Scott stating they were no longer the towels they had been purchasing for years simply because they were now in tighter/smaller wrappers.  Go figure.  But importantly this item was at a substantial discount under $27 and way too many people both described them as the most absorbent and also the softest?  That's going to be a disappointment when I make other purchases in the future because these are rough enough to buff metal.I am only willing to give 4 stars because I believe all the extreme positives exaggerated.What I do know is they are good at cleanup, but can never replace a full size paper towel for mere size.  I will go for them initially anytime it will not be contacting my mouth.  But once the price for 2,400 sheets goes any amount over $30 I will buy the Scott 01840's.

I started using these during the pandemic when the thought of guest using my hand towels grossed me out. They keep my cootie passing phobia in check. Keep a watch on their price as it fluctuates. They are not super absorbent or soft but are much more cost effective than the nicer ones. If you need disposable paper towels for daily tasks, these work fine. I do not use them for cleaning as they tend to smear and leave streaks. They are mainly for quick dries after handwashing.

I purchased these in error.  For some reason I thought I was buying tissues.  At any rate, I decided to keep them because I have pets and will definitely go through them.  I will say without a dispenser, they can be a pain, but if you are buying these you probably have a dispenser.Not the most absorbent but for drying hands, or quick cleanups they are fine.

The product fulfills the needs that it was purchased for. They are not the most absorbent, but they do the job for wet hands, you just need another product for anything that is sticky or really messy. Overall, a good product\ and design. we purchased the single fold over and they would get stuck together sometimes, but the trifold is a better design and application.

I like the quality of the paper towels. They are strong. You only need one to dry your hands. Other paper towels that I ordered,  I had to use two.

I feel like I'm spoiling myself every time I use them. They are thick (not like cardboard), they absorb water quickly.They aren't super soft, but they don't scratch my hands up either. Would buy again.

We tried several brands and like these the best. Sturdy when wet yet not too coarse or scratchy.

works pretty good in our dispenser but NOT a soft towel. its a bit rough but works on counter tops and stove. you can dry hands but would not suggest for face. we bought the york ones now ( with the leaves), much softer but more $$ and doesn't always come out of the dispenser without ripping

I've searched for and wide for a paper that can dry hands and wipe spills with a single sheet, with no luck. Then up popped on Amazon this Kleenex product. Incredibly sturdy but soft enough for a nose blow (at least for a guy) and strong enough for a small spill. With two you can wipe up a nuke power plant discharge. Well, that's a lie. It fits in our pop-up dispenser and will be our fave brand from here on.

I like these towels for drying hands. Since I got a kidney transplant a year and a half ago, I’ve had to be very careful with cleanliness. I started using these instead of using hand towels unless the towels are fresh from the dryer. I use them after washing my hands and while cooking to keep my hands clean before handling food. One towel does the job. I hate wasting paper and I never used paper towels before this. I reuse these, not for hands but for cleaning. I let them dry, and use them like paper towels for cleaning up messes since they’re not really dirty after just drying clean hands. There is only me at my house and a case has lasted me a year and a half. I haven’t bought a dispenser. I use the long tissue boxes and they work fine. Remove the plastic under the hole on the top of the box. The towels are a little too long so I cut off one side of the tissue box. It’s easier than fussing with picking up a sheet in a stack.

I’ve been looking for a more affordable way to buy the Kleenex Expressions Paper Towels. These are not as soft at all, and have a ribbed texture to them which feels abrasive. The absorption is less with these - X2 of these to every 1 expressions towel.

We have tried several other paper towel from Amazon and this is the best one by far. The Kleenex paper towel is thick, durable and we use far less towels during the day. A real keeper, I’ll never use another.

This is better than a cheaper brand I tried.I needed two pieces of the other brand to equal just one piece of this brand.Will be repurchasing this brand next time.

This is a great product. Compared to other similar products, it is the softest of the three I've tried, and far more absorbent. I find that one is sufficient for wet hands, while others require two.I am frustrated by the difficulty finding out whether this contains post consumer recycled fiber.  This matters to me because I have found numerous studies that show that post con rec fiber products, including towels, have a high level of bacteria. The frustration stems from the obscurity of the answer to that question.  I finally found one commercial product site that says that this contains 10% pre consumer and 40% post consumer recycled fiber. So then I called Kimberly Clark and asked the customer service rep the same question. She said that her information shows no recycled fiber content.So: caveat emptor. Great product. But if you are seeking something made of virgin fiber, that is not carrying recycled germs and fungus, keep on checking. I still don't know what the truth is.

These are not as soft as some Kleenex products, but they are reasonable to use for utilitarian purposes such as soaking up water or drying your hands or serving as temporary "placemats" for things you want to set down by your sink.  They are quite economical.  They are designed to be used in dispensers of the kind that you find in some public restrooms and some workplaces, but I put them in a plastic towel holder by my sinks. I like to use them so I don't get greasy stuff or medications on my cloth towels.  For example, sunscreen can get all over your hands and I prefer to dry them off after washing with these towels.

One you get used to not being able to just pull a few sheets off the roll, this is a fine alternative to rolls of paper towel.  Not as convenient since it needs a dispenser that my mischievous cat can get at, but that was easily solved by relocating the paper towel dispenser.I also like this since I can easily put some sheets in other rooms in a neat stack.Holds up well to cleaning up cat vomit.

During the Covid epidemic I washed my hands so many times a day that I might have three or four hand towels by the end of the day. After drying my hands a couple of times the towel always felt damp which gave me a bad feeling. I bought a dispenser and these paper towels and put all of my hand towels away. No more wet towels to dry my hands on. I love these, I just wash, dry and toss in the trashcan. I always have a clean towel when I wash my hands. May not be good for trees that it really keeps the germs at bay.

These towels are effective for drying hands and mopping up spills. They are not for cleaning children's faces as they are stiff. The value is good and I am pleased with my purchase. In my home setting they will last a long time so are economical. But next time I order I will try to find a softer one.

I love the price, I buy these for my house because I have dispensers all over I have slight OCD but hey who likes germs? Lol and it save me money. They are a little rugged than what I expected from Kleenex but hey they are for drying hand and wiping things up so over all great item.

The product gets 5 stars!!! These are strong and absorbent paper towels! When compared to other paper towels, I only need one towel to dry both of my hands and turn off the faucet...one! Now, these are NOT super fluffy and soft but they do what they are supposed to do....dry hands, wipe surfaces, etc. without falling apart! Quality product!The BEST part is that they are about $10 less thanSamsClub!!! Add to that free Prime shipping to your front door...superb!The reason for the 4 stars...The Amazon delivery driver sat my box of PAPER TOWELS out in the pouring rain to get soaking wet! When all he/she had to do was ring my bell to give them directly to me, so they wouldn’t get wet!HOWEVER, I called Amazon Customer Service, they apologized and immediately sent out a replacement box, free of additional charges! Thank you, Amazon!

Strong absorption, could stand to work better in the dispenser  they get stuck

These towels are a tougher more durable paper towel than you typically find in most American public restrooms, but are roughly similar to any other folded dispenser towel. They are not "soft" but neither are they as rough as the most common/cheapest varieties, and though they are plenty absorptive I sometimes feel that the rough, dry papery ones are actually more "rapidly" absorptive. These work exactly as I had hoped though, as I wanted better durability for cleaning tasks/sensitization, and while I have no idea about typical cost or value for these items, this package seemed price competitive with similar non name brand products.

These are great but don’t be fooled — they aren’t soft like the paper towels at fancy 5 star restaurants. If I had a chance to order again, I’d order the soft ones but since they come in such a large quantity I’ll be using these until Christmas.

I bought these paper towels to use in a black bamboo paper towel holder. They are approximately 9 1/2 inches square and have a texture, which probably contributes to their absorbancy. I can easily dry my hands with one towel, AND, these towels have an added advantage, because if I notice a splatter on the bathroom mirror, I can use the same towel, which does a great job of cleaning without leaving any streaks or lint!. A dry paper towel also polishes the chrome faucets. These towels are not pure white, which might be a consideration if you have a white dispenser, but they are perfect in my black bamboo holder, which at an angle looks a little "espresso."

I'm here the same reason as you – I run a business and want to save money wherever I can. My clients need to dry their hands in the bathroom, sure, but does it really matter if the paper towels aren't baby soft? Their softness and texture could be described as...about two clicks away from being actual printing paper. But who cares! Two of these bad boys will dry your hands up real nice. You CAN dry your hands with just one, but you better get a nice pre-towel shakey shake followed by the use of every square millimeter of that paper towel. "Soft and Highly Absorbent" – technically true if by "soft" you mean "soft after submerging in water" and by "highly absorbent" you mean "when using more than one towel". God bless you Kleenex

I like the Pacific brand much better. These, although they work okay, are thinner and less absorbent. They fit in my countertop dispenser, but because of the way they're folded, trying to grab one with wet, just washed hands, always results in getting at least two of them wet. Only reason I ordered these was because the Pacific brand was out of stock. Not likely to buy this brand again.

Happy to not have to use and reuse the same half towel to dry my hands on my many trips to the rest room. I wash my hands several times throughout the course of a single day especially with COVID. They are sufficient for my needs and last as long a could be expected.

Great for the bathrooms

I actually like these more than I thought I would! Having them pre-cut definitely encourages less waste, and they are strong enough to handle all my basic cleaning tasks. They are not soft, and have limited absorbency (think kind of push spills around rather than soak them up) but the fibers are good for scrubbing and they work well if you aren't using a lot of liquid. I needed to buy a dispenser, which I found kind of pricey, but since I will buy these again I'm OK with that.

There’s a review for this product that purports to be the definitive review for this type of paper towel. That review referred to these towels having a texture and feel that’s almost “fabric” like. Uh, no. These are tri fold paper towels. They are reasonably absorbent. They are NOT particularly soft. Actually, they’re closer to a Brillo pad than fabric in terms of feel.  I’d buy them again in a pinch, say, oh I don’t know, a pandemic, but they’re adequate at best. This is a 3-1/2 star product.

Started use during the 2020 paper product shortage.  They work good and aren't too much more expensive  than the consumer rolls.  A dispenser for these type of towels (5$-10$) is best to have/get as they are hard to use just as a pile where you pull off one.  I continue to use them even after paper product shortage is over.

I put these in a basket in my guest bathroom in place of cloth towels. They're not as thick and absorbent as paper towels from a roll, but they are good for drying your hands. This one case will last me years, I'm sure. The only criticism I have, and it's a small one, is that each bundle is large--there are twice as many towels in a bundle as will neatly stack in the basket in my bathroom without falling over. So I open the wrapper, take out about half, and then have to put the rest back in storage loosely wrapped in the remains of the paper wrapper. It would be better for my purposes if the bundles were half the size. But it's a small complaint.

I have a dispenser in the kitchen. These are perfect for everyday use. I often times find myself reaching for them instead of the paper towel roll. Been ordering them for about a year now.

I am testing some brand out and so far these  are softer than the Genuine Joe ones I bought last year. They absorb better and are stronger and thicker, which would explain the price difference. They are great to clean mirrors, countertops and dry hands. However, if you are looking for the super soft, these are not them but this beats paying loads of $ for paper towels rolls. I will purchase again and recommend for families especially with small children for clean ups.

Not sure what happened with this shipment, but I've been ordering these paper towels for years and have never experienced a bad smell from the paper itself. It's only after I've dried my hands that the smell becomes apparent and lingers on my hands for a few minutes before it goes away. Still good quality towels (hence the 4-stars) and, since I got such a large pack, I won't be returning these, but the smell is bad enough to mention.

These paper towels are strong and you don't need more than one to either wipe up a spill or dry your hands after washing.  However, contrary to what some reviewers are saying, I don't find them to be particularly soft.  They are not rough like sandpaper, but they do not have the texture of regular roll paper towels.  They are a little on the stiff side, but that is what makes them strong.  At any rate, they are working our very well for my purposes.  I wanted to get rid of the roll paper towels and the constant problem of not being able to pull off just one towel at a time.  These are working very well for that purpose.

After trying kleenex hand wipes in a box, they were so soft but you needed like 3 of them to dry, and it costs more $$$, so I went to these, much cheaper but I was surprised that they were not very soft at all and you still need 2-3 sheets. So, after we finish these, I'll go back to the other.

This was a good buy since I can’t find the hand towels I normally use.  They work fine as a throwaway hand towel.  I just wish they weren’t so stiff and were softer.  Good to use for your bathroom if you don’t want everyone to use the same hand towel, and if you have sickness in the household.

As the headline says these are good for hand towels/drying your hands but as napkins they might as well be sandpaper on your face.Was hoping I could use these for dual purposes during this time to save on traditional paper towel usage but while they do work as a napkin, they aren't the type of napkins I would use by choice.

Convenient. Great value. Better than regular paper towels.

We have paper towel dispensers in the kitchen and bathroom - and these are perfect.  No more soggy guest towels in the powder room.

This product is the best I have used.  I was accidentally sent the brown folded towels, couldn’t wait to use those, horrible.

These paper towels are great for kitchen or bathroom. If you are looking for a very soft towel then these would not be your choice. But if you are looking for a sturdy paper towel to get the job done they work great. I have a glass top stove and love to clean and polish with these towels.

Good towels. Not cheap like other brands.

If I could find a softer brand I would bd grateful, for the advice.  I have bought these because they fit the dispensers I bought, I will experiment with others.  Very rough to the touch, not as absorbent as I would like.  But functional

These were on sale at the time I purchased. I loved the volume, but they were not as soft as I’m accustomed too. They did the job, but I prefer softer especially with so much hand washing nowadays.

Great value nice to have a better option rather then air drying for my son and I didn’t realize lasted 4 1/2 months I’ll reorder asap

Not sure if it's dispenser or durability of towels, but lots of ripped towels getting out of dispenser.. Good paper towels though for everyday use I will say otherwise.

I use these in my kitchen to replace regular paper towels. When there was a shortage, I bought these. They are rather stiff but absorbent. I’m glad I have these.

Not really soft or absorbent. They're okay, had a slight smell to them when they came. I just wanted then as hand towels for drying my hands after washing

These paper towels are worth the price. The cheaper ones start to rip as soon as they get wet. These are though and durable. You only need one to dry hands. Material is on the rougher side since it’s pretty thick. They are good size and can be used to clean or to keep in the bathroom to dry your hands. We put these out in the bathroom for our guests when visiting.

We finally got to the last pack of paper towels and so I came back here to purchase another case. The price seemed a little high compared to other brands so I started looking around for somethings a little less pricey; but when I realized it took us over 2 years (purchased May 2022) to go through the case, I figured why bother rolling the dice compromising quality over cost.These paper towels are fantastic- thick, soft, absorbent, and plenty large enough. Sometimes when it's a small spill, I'll tear it in half before using it. They fit in the wall dispenser perfectly and I've never had any tearing or multiple sheets come through. I'm fact, I didn't even know this was a problem with other people's towels until I started reading reviews on here. So yeah, gonna stick with the ones I picked originally.

These Kleenex, paper towels, surprised me they are so thick I would definitely highly recommend these. Before I ordered these I had ordered a much cheaper product and they were so flimsy. I had to use three or four of them to dry my hands. These you only need one! Definitely worth the little extra money they cost. The texture Is firm, Great product will definitely be buying these from now on!

I've been ordering these for several years now.  They are thick and very absorbent, but still kind of soft.  I use them for daily spot cleaning and such.  I've tried other brands, but this is definitely best bang for the buck.

We have a bamboo dispenser for these next to our wet bar and pretty plastic rectangle containers for them in each bathroom. They're sturdy and great for wiping spills and countertops and sometimes drying hands. I dont like drying my hands on other people's towels so i like for people to have that option at our house. They are not soft but rougher and sturdier than paper towels. I would not put them in a bathroom kids use because they would probably flush them which would not be good.  I wish they were softer but we find lots of uses for them so I gave them a 5.  I don't know if everyone would like them or find them useful.

The media could not be loaded.
                



These are so convenient.  We have dispensers in each bathroom and order refills every 6 months or so.  They make it easy to clean up the surfaces or to dry hands without extra laundry. They are pretty sturdy.  Just know they're not too soft so you won't want to dry your face or blow your nose with them.

This is not the first time I've bought them.  I was surprised at the quality.  I was expecting the towels to be pretty rough and well... cheap feeling.  I was definitely wrong.  Surprisingly much softer than the typical paper towels that come from dispensers. They are kinda mighty too,  don't tear easily when you don't want them too.  They dispense one at a time with ease.  I didn't realize how long they would last.  There is alllloooooot of paper towels.  Seems nothing is cheap these days with rising prices,  but I feel for the quality and quantity, the cost was worth it. I've now started friends and family buying the same.  Food for thought,  don't go real cheap on the dispenser.  Get something nice and sturdy.  I like the ones that have a lock with a key.  Keeps them clean and not exposed to things.  I think they look nice too with so many styles and cookies colors available. I've got one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  Guests love them.  Most people don't want to dry their hands on someone else's cloth towels.  They are great for clean ups and I use them did cleaning windows and mirrors because they don't leave the dust like regular paper towels can. The paper that holds the individual packs together is strong.  My first case of 16 packs lasted about a year and not one of the bundles broke open.  Just a nice little thanks that they didn't go cheap.  Nothing worse than a pile of multifold paper towels now a pile of multi mess! Little helper note: when you open a new bundle,  hold one end of the stack with 2 hands and shake it, fanning them,  and then hold the other end and do the same.  By loosening them a bit they dispense perfectly.

This product is wonderful and just as great as Scott paper towels which I have brought in the past

Cheaper than the rolls at x10 more is seems.  Best for clean up in kitchen and full bathroom cleaning.

I usually buy the cheapest tri fold towels. But I was so tired of having to use two or three just to dry my hands, so I ordered these. The cost is more but I doubt I am spending as much as I did on the cheap ones because I use less now. These towels work so well that I feel bad when I use one for my hands because it could still handle another job after that. They really are very nice and I love the look of the white towels in my kitchen. I keep them in a clear dispenser and it looks so clean...much better than the cheap brown ones.

Reasonable size and the price is right.

One napkin and it drys.

You have to use two to completely dry your hands but one gets the job done if you dont mind hands staying a little wet

The towels are very good quality. Thick and works great for clean ups.

Best paper towels we have tried!  Very thick!

I bought these to help save money in my home Daycare. The children can pull off one at a time vs the towels on a roll. They always pull off too many.

I continue to order this product for my home. This keeps me from having a hand towel that get wet so fast and the paper towels are so easy to dispose.

The Kleenx towels are so much better than Scott towels.

I love using that’s paper towels. I have them in my guest bathroom. My guest have said they appreciate the thoughtfulness of germ free towels instead of everyone sharing one towel.

I always buy this brand. Lasts a long time tio

I have bought these folded paper towels for years. I have several bamboo boxes they fit in perfectly, made for them, even have 1 at my desk at work. Just put one stack, that is wrapped in paper, in bamboo wood holder. Fits perfectly. Got bamboo boxes for paper towels here on Amazon. Recommend you get themThey are heavy duty.

These towels are thicker and absorb very well, unlike the standard brown tri fold towels that are out there. Very satisfied with this purchase.

Much softer than the brown ones and gentle on hands

i use the product for everything

I switched to the folded paper towels during Covid lockdowns and I like them MUCH better than the rolls of paper towels. The Kleenex brand does not disappoint as far as absorbency and durability; I don't care about softness since I have facial tissues for that. I would prefer a single fold towel than the trifold, but that's the only thing I'd change (besides the price).

Good product for office restroom.

During the beginning of the pandemic, I was afraid that I would run out of my basic paper products because everything seemed to sell out as soon as they hit the grocery store shelves. I searched for an alternative product & ended up purchasing another brand trifold paper towels from another retailer at first and a plastic dispenser for under $10 from Amazon. Much later, I switched to this brand of trifold paper towels which were a better grade product than what I originally bought. Ever since, I have kept these stocked in my home. They are so handy and we've saved a lot of money on our regular top dollar brand of roll paper towels by saving them for use when we need a heavy duty of that kind. These towels are sturdy & one is perfect for drying your hands and other day to day uses. I love that you can grab one with one hand and not have to touch anything else. We keep the dispenser right by the kitchen sink and we intend to keep using these (this brand in particular) forever! Highly recommend 👌

soft & absorbent

Just what I wanted, .thickness,quality.

Towels are great ordered towel holder for wall both broke .order the clear for counter nice set.

We've tried several brands of office-type paper towels like this (tri-fold), and we've come back to Kleenex brand. The others were so thin we found ourselves using two to dry our hands! Though they were a little lower in price, doubling up on the cheap ones definitely wiped out the savings and made those more expensive in the end. The Kleenex ones are sturdy, soft enough, and while not really inexpensive, we can save a bit by buying them bulk here in a big box of 16 packs. Reusable towels are great, but when you're cleaning up messes on the floor, cleaning after pets, or even wiping up milk, we prefer to use something where we can throw the mess out, rather than go thru extra gallons of water cleaning & re-cleaning to get them really clean. So disposables have their place, to us. These are the best buy for our money that we've found.

The most important review for me was by Bret with a thorough comparison with other products. It was posted on January 15, 2014. I get annoyed when people have dirty hands and hold the roll to tear off the paper towels. Not to mention the ones that don't touch the roll but just jerk it and waste so many paper towels. This product solves the problem. Now I will talk about the "Kleenex Multifold Paper Towels (01890)" that I purchased. I read a lot of the reviews and here is my opinion.*First, I didn't buy these to wipe a baby's face (although they would be great when wet). I have been making my own baby wipes out of regular bounty and aldi paper towels for a long time when I found out about formaldehyde being in the big name brands.*Second, I was skeptical when I read some of the negative reviews, but I gave it a shot based on Bert's review. I knew we would used them somehow even if they weren't the quality I hoped for. Don't believe the naysayers. I am highly critical of cleaning products (being a germie-phobe).Conclusion: These paper towels are awesome! Imagine a medium starched cotton broadcloth with bumps. (I am posting pics of the paper towel dry and wet.) When they are damp or wet they become very smooth and soft. They are VERY strong and absorbent. My kitchen and bathroom are SO clean now (as if they weren't already) but it is so easy to grab one, pump a dab of cleaning liquid on it and wipe away. I love looking at the dirt and grime it picked up when I thought it was already totally OR sanitized. (How is that even possible?) They don't tear or shred or bunch up when wiping surfaces like a regular bountie (intentional sp*). One towel is plenty to dry hands. I'm happy with not wasting so much paper and the price is great too. I plan to sign up on a delivery subscription with my next order.Also my indecision on the right dispenser...I chose this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040ZOE7Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is not exactly as shown on the page, but had "Scott" logo on the front. I plan to put a cute sticker over it for decoration. The towels fit perfectly and dispense great also. (Will be posting a review on it also.) It is heavy duty plastic and easy to load.So from me to you: HAPPY WIPING!!

We buy these a lot for our community theatre

They are affordable without sacrificing quality, which is important for my small business.Eco-Friendliness:While I appreciate the quality of these paper towels, I do wish they were more eco-friendly.

I love these.. soft, they last a long time for me then the once from sams club

Great job

We like this product in our guest bathroom.

Well, I've run through what's availabile locally/Amazon and here's my review of the different brand multifold towels.  My review is based on using a SINGLE towel to dry freshly washed (and gently shaked) hands.  Requirement was to have sufficiently dry hands (absorbancy) without easily tearing (durability).  Ratings are 1-5 stars.  I did not factor in price (they are all within ~$10 of each other) or box quantity.SCOTT Multifold Paper Towels (Amazon)Absorbency: ** (2 stars)Durability: ***** (5 stars)Overall: ** (2 stars)These ranked lowest on absorbency (only wax paper is less absorbent), but high on durability.  Two towels required to sufficiently dry hands, but little/no tearing.Marathon Multifold Paper Towels (Costco)Absorbency: *** (3 stars)Durability: ** (2 stars)Overall: *** (3 stars)Your average towel.  Med absorbency, med durability.  You effectively needed two towels to dry OR carefully dry with one towel.  Rips easily when wet.Georgia-Pacific Signature White 2-Ply Premium Multifold Paper Towel (Amazon)Absorbency: *** (3 stars)Durability: *** (3 stars)Overall: *** (3 stars)Very similar to the Marathon in overall performance, slightly more absorbent.Kimberly-Clark Professional KLEENEX Multifold Paper Towels (Amazon)Absorbency: ***** (5 stars)Durability: ***** (5 stars)Overall: ***** (5 stars)Top of the line.  Excellent absorbency and durability, easily drys hands with one towel without ripping/tearing.  Good comfortable texture and composition, almost approaches fabric in appearance and feel.  As far as I'm concerned, these are the towels by which all others are measured.

Good quality paper towels. Only need one to dry hands.

Like many of you, I used cloth hand towels in the bathroom. Over, and over, and over. I always wondered just how long was too long to reuse them. Since I started using individual paper towels, I don't worry about that. Or the real possibility that my cloth towels were not so clean. But with a paper towel, it is one and done. Guests don't have to use my towels! And I don't have to use my towels after a guest! I'll continue using paper.

During Covid I purchased a n oak towel holder and these towels for my kitchen counter next to my sink.They have been such a big hit that I will not part with them.The holder is attractive and the towels strong and absorbent.  Highly recommended.

Loved the softness and durability

Like it? Love it? Heck no.. these are definately "Gotta Have It!"..I purchased these after reading a plethora of reviews on the folding industrial paper towels. In my household we have always used bounty rolls and we just go through them way too fast. I needed a cost effective alternative, so after a bit of research this was it.  I paid $20 for a clear plastic dispenser that I stealthily mounted on a cabinet side a bit out of the way near the back door in kitchen. Then I filled it up when these arrived and started using them for just myself at first. I knew it wasnt going to be a happy transition in my house. Cost saving techniques rarely are.. So my wife wasnt happy about it at first once finding out and my daughter didnt know what to do with one since its not on a roll.. but after couple weeks everyone had a chance to try them and we ended up going thru 1 sleeve in the course of about a month. I love the absorbency of these. I always hated to waste towels when washing my hands not to mention grabbing a roll with wet hands means you end up with a wet roll and have to tear off even more sheets than needed bevasue they become unusable.. not with these bad guys.. grap the bottom and yank and 1 comes out..  I use 2 when i wash hands and its perfect. When we spill something, We grab a handful rather than half the roll..  They work awesome, everyone loves them now and the price is awesome. I wont be going back to bounty,

Buy these for my work. They are soft yet durable and very good quality. Will keep buying

I've tried several brands of C Fold towels, and these hands down are the best.  They are very thick, fit perfect size wise in my Tork C fold towel holder, just can't fit the entire pack of towels which is fine with me, I put the remaining towels in the bathroom on the sink in a pretty holder for guests to use.  Other C folds I would need 2 or 3 to do what 1 of these does!

I love the thickness and the quality of the paper.

Good quality! Used in my tiny house on wheels for washing dishes!

It is so much more hygienic to dry hands on disposable towels, rather than towels used by multiple people. This brand is more substantial than previous brands I've used; good value for the money. They're thicker and softer.

I've been getting cheap paper towel before from Costco or Amazon. This product actually feels better quality overall with the amount of liquid it can absorb. The only con I can see from this product is the fact it feels very rough when it's dry. Once it gets wet it feels soft on skin. I will probably be getting this paper towel from now on instead of Costco.

I like to have them in a dispenser  in my guest bathroom so that guests don't worry about germs on a towel. Nice soft texture.

If you get a faulty product and can't resolve the issue by making a return, you will be forwarded to Kimberly-Clark customer support. Instead of replacing the product or issuing a refund, they send you “some coupons through the mail,” which barely cover the cost of the product you had to file the claim for and that you can't use on Amazon or anywhere I usually shop. I won't be purchasing again.

Since March, of this year, 2013, this product has been $15.90, with subscribe and save, and free shipping with Prime.Now, for the month of June 2013, the price for me has increased to $18.72, a $2.82 increase from the same $15.90 from the month of May 2013.Most would not consider this a big deal as having items shipped to your door, 2nd day with Prime, is nice but that is almost 3 bucks. The local Dollar Store has these for $16 but you must pay tax, physically go to the store, etc.This is not all. I sincerely wish I had some of the towels left from the May boxes because they are now shipping redesigned towels and boxes. Yes, if you still have a box from May, compare it to your June box.The June box is smaller, which is nice because it takes up slightly less space on the towel rod but I also noticed something else... This is where I cannot truly verify my own feelings. An anecdote, if you will... The towels from the new box feel "lighter" and a tad bit smaller. This falls to the chicken/egg idea... Folks, I noticed there was a difference in towel absorbency and "feeling" BEFORE I checked the boxes.While the boxes claim the same dimensions on the towels, there is nothing to denote a specific "weight" to the towels that would indicate strength or surface area to roughly equate to the ability to absorb moisture.I feel as if the trend with these Kleenex Hand Towels are going the way of many of the toliet papers that are being sold here on Amazon. The companies will build up very high regard, and this reviews, for a product and then make slight price increases and lessen the material [read smaller boxes=smaller towel density] and thus increase profit with virtually no one taking notice. I want to call this a halo product but it is more of a "bait and switch" and "supply/demand/price increase" thing.I loved the old towels, as of May 2013, but now I am considering a cancellation of my subscribe and save. Almost a 3 dollar price increase and I am getting less to dry my large American hands... No thanks.

For many years, a lot of Kimberly-Clark brands have been my family's trusted go-to product. In fact, I used to get these delivered at my door step each month on a subscribe and save plan.  However, after calling customer service and waiting and waiting for a change, I will no longer be using this product or maybe purchasing anymore brands from Kimberly-Clark.  The reason being along with the one star is the hand towels no longer hold the quality like they use to. This product is now no different than a sheet of thick toilet paper or thick kleenex.  I get more out of my wallet using paper towels at this rate than purchasing this junk every month.  So, if you like throwing away your money to paper that doesn't dry your hands, by all means be my guest and go ahead. . . Otherwise, I recommend using paper towels instead if your need is disposable hand towels or just buying a bunch of wash cloths in bulk to hand dry once.  And for anyone at Kimberly-Clark reading this . . . if you want to see better reviews and a change of stars, then please change your product.  Customer after customer have complained about your hand towels and yet there has been no change.  Either improve your product or discontinue it all together. . . Once you do, I'll be more than willing to redo this review and hopefully you get a happy returning customer.

I have been buying these disposable hand towels for years and used to absolutely love them.  I gave some to my ophthalmologist and told him how handy they were for people like me who have to use eye drops several times a day and have to keep our hands and around our eyes clean and sterile.  I recommended that he tell his patients about them.  I have also given them to family members and bragged about how great they are.  But now I am greatly disappointed because they are not as sturdy, fall apart when you wet them, and they stick together when you try to pull one out from the dispenser.  I subscribed on Amazon for delivery of six boxes every three months, but I am considering canceling the subscription.  Kleenex (Kimberly-Clark) needs to pay attention to all the negative reviews regarding the significantly reduced quality of this product and go back to making these hand towels like they used to.

This product (not seller) turned out to be a disappointment to me. I recently had the opportunity to use a Kleenex Hand Towel to dry my hands at a local restaurant and was so impressed with their disposable towels I took the cover off their towel holder to see what brand they were. I have large hands and often must use 2 or 3 towels to dry. I was easily able to use one towel in this restaurant and also found them very durable. So much so that I pulled my phone out and immediately ordered what I thought was the same towel (same brand/name). What I discovered with the arrival of these towels is that they are smaller and less durable. In fact, a paper towel off the roll is better. So there must be a commercial version or something that eluded me. If you are looking for a smaller disposable towel, perhaps this is right for you but they are worthless to me.

These were my FAVORITE!!! I got so tired of expensive hand towels being ruined on the regular so I switched to these and only have what I call "deco towels" in all the bathrooms and by the busy sinks and most used areas. BUT THESE NEW BOXES, THE COLORS AND HIDEOUS DESIGNS, there's absolutely no way I'm going to put them all over my house!!! I am really annoyed!!!! So ugly!!!!

I have ordered these twice.  Each time, I received 5 boxes as pictured; off-white/gray and dark gray.....PLUS, the 6th box was, OH GOOD GRIEF, you have got to be kidding!  The box is a mixture of back/white checkers;  then yellow background with hot pink roses, deep blue color on the sides,& the back is completely hot pink background with hot pink roses!  To add insult to this, ( I am assuming) that the seller SIGNED THE BOXES WITH HER NAME AND PUT XOX NEXT TO HER NAME!  What?  Why didn't the description/picture as advertised note that ONE box was going to be WEIRD and with someone's name and xoxox on it?  I would NOT have ordered.  I do NOT want some weird printed box of hand cloths in my guest bathrooms.. You can find the Kleenex Hand Towels at Stater Brothers grocery stores.  Plus, you won't waste $$$ on someone's idea of 'cute' ....I will not order from this seller again.

Don't understand why you needed to change the design without putting out a new SKU. These new designs are just ugly and don't go with any home decor. Would much rather have the option to keep buying the ones we had, or have at least plain looking boxes available (or a cover.) Cancelled my Subscription for another product, since I would never want to show these to guests in my home.

I usually am very satisfied with my purchases of Kleenex  Expression Hand Towels.  The boxes are very neutral and nice colors to place in your bathrooms. The boxes are pretty golds, greens, taupe etc.The Kleenex boxes delivered today contained 6 boxes of the most hideous colors that you could ever imagined.These boxes resemble very cheap gift wrapping paper from the clearance section. Very dull will never buy again.

I purchased a 6 pack of kleenex hand towels but only received 4 shrinked wrapped in a box.

These BRIGHT UGLY BOXES are not it!  THEY DON’T MATCH ANYTHING!  Please go back to the neutral colors boxes, something that actually matches my decor or at least give us the option to choose which color boxes we want.  I love these towels and my guests do as well but these colors are an eyesore in my bathrooms.

1 box empty other than the one that was sticking out of the end when I opened the box. See photos. Box isnt opened nowhere. I have been ordering these several times a month for so long now

Hand towels are a good product. Not sure why Kleenex decided to put inside such horribly designed boxes.

I have seen a commercial on television recently which I agree with when it states, "Your hands are only as clean as the towel you dry them on."  These are packaged to allow them to sit upside down on a towel bar or right side up on a counter.  They are absorbent and work very well.Update:  I ordered these several times and was very pleased with their quality and gave them 5 stars.  The product changed.  They now rip very easily and are not nearly as absorbent as they had been in the past.  They are so thin that to get them started out of the box, several rip.  I will no longer order this product and will find something else that is equal to the product before they made the change.

I love Kleenex hand towels, but when my shipment arrived, the hand towel boxes weren't like the photo, the boxes were covered with designs by Betsi Johnson. These towels were supposed to be for my two sons to take to their dorms, but the last thing my boys wanted was a hand towel box decorated with bright pink roses in the shape of hearts. And the design isn't my taste either, so I emptied out an old box and filled it with the new towels and threw the bizarre box away.  And I cancelled the auto ordering for this product. Don't want to buy more until this lame design is phased out. So I want to Target to some, and guess what--a shelf full of the Betsi Johnson designed boxes on clearance and no normal boxes.  I asked an associate said the new design didn't sell. Duh!

Kleenex needs to return the original box pattern of this product. Not  everyone wants in their bathroom decor of cherries, etc. not attractive. The old  pattern was more neutral and classic. It matched a larger number of bathrooms decor.  Please consider, thank you!

I do NOT like the new fruity colors on the Kleenex hand towel boxes. I will NOT buy these boxes until they return to their original designs.I will NOT buy the fruity colored hand towel boxes. Please return to the original design!

There were little bugs that looked like little spiders creeper me out the box was sealed so I don't know if a bug layer eggs in there or what but creepy

These hand towels were a 5 star item, thick and clean and effective. This "new and improved" barely 1 star version is literally unsanitary looking with big patchy holes in it and the towels are a fraction of the size. Immediate return.

I loved the Kleenex hand towels and I enjoyed getting them delivered but the colors of the new boxes didn’t fit my ecstatic and I wasn’t offered another choice so I have to say goodbye.

I ordered these hand towels previously through subscribe & save. They were packaged in grays, golds, & silver colors that matched my bathroom decor.  These hand towels are packaged in florals & fruits.  Will cancel my subscribe & save if this happens again.

I like the product that was presented, but received the wipes in boxes that didn't fit on your towel holder. I have purchased the product many times and they were so handy; the "boxes" of these towels I just received couldn't be placed anywhere in the bathroom like the other boxes that were what I had used. Those had the ability to be placed on the towel rack, the boxes had a different shape which was especially nice for guests.

I've subscribed to these for years. This was the first order containing boxes with such bold patterns. All previous orders were more neutral. Do not like these at all.

I am a year behind because I had ordered these towels in a greater frequency and quantity than I should have done.  The customers who complained that the Kleenex hand towels delivered after May 2013  are smaller, softer/thinner than the ones delivered only a few months before (May 2013 or earlier) are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. These are smaller and disintegrate when wet. And what a shame that the manufacturer insists there is no change in either size of each towel or its strength. I have boxes of each... The dimensions given on both on the outside of the box clearly document the size change. The quality decrement is immediately noticeable. Why would K-C deny it!!??i am going to cancel my subscription.

I love these for the bathroom.  But the new packaging is terrible.  Does not match any decor.  Please bring back the old packaging.  Who wants Cherry’s or all the other ugly packages.

Previous ones had beautiful neutral colors and patterns. They now come in ugly bright patterns. Immediately unsubscribed on Amazon

Have been buying this product for I don’t know how long. Have NEVER received these ugly boxes. Will use in our bathroom and try to save my pleasant boxes for guest bathrooms. Cancelled my subscribe and save for that reason.

I have been getting these for years but cancelled my subscription because I dont like the new hideous prints. The old print was subtle enough to leave out! Please bring back the old prints!

I read a lot of reviews before ordering these. There are a lot of 5 star reviews and quite a few 1-2 star reviews. These would probably work fine if you want to turn the box upside down on a towel rack and pull them out like you would paper towels in a public bathroom. I ordered these as guest towels for our powder room, and bought a separate metal display tray. They aren't separate towels; instead they are flimsy tissue/towels that pull out like tissues from a tissue box and are very cheap looking and feeling.

Overall I love the product and have been using them for years.  Because I was no longer able to find them in my local stores, I ordered from Amazon.  I'm not sure if I would order from Amazon again.  Two of the boxes were all squished and I'm not sure if they are going to stand up.  They don't look very nice in the bathroom for use as a replacement to hand towels.

The photo advertised is NOT what you get. The new "Betsey" design is gaudy and distasteful! How can bright yellow, blue, pink and black go with any bathroom decor? I will continue to buy these because I love the convenience of the towels, but can only give it 1 star because of the hideous box design. Bring back the muted colors in your picture, please!

These were wonderful and I was on auto delivery. The last box I opened was different and I was very disappointed. They were thinner, less soft and absorbent and when you pull one out you now need two hands to prevent the others from following and sticking to the first. I really do not like the new version and if this is the way they continue to come, I will have to find a better quality replacement.

In receiving my order of 6 Kleenex hand towel boxes. I was down to my last box in the shipment box I observed the box was empty of hand towels inside. The box was sealed as if it had not been touched. Though no product inside.

I want the sixth box that I paid for, only 5 were shipped.

We've been getting these great hand towels every month since 2017. But due to the Covid effects on our business, we've been trying to cancel this subscription for three months. This product is not showing up on our subscriptions and only shows up as an order after delivery. I guess we're going to return them each month since we can't seem to stop them from shipping.

I dislike box colors shown that you do not receive and boxes crushed inside smaller box to save you money and you don't CARE.

I OPENED THE FIRST BOX, AND ALL THE PAPERTOWELS SMELLED LIKE VINEGAR!!  i COULD NOT RETURN.

I’ve been purchasing this product for several years. Unfortunately they’ve changed the box design to match absolutely nothing so I won’t purchase again.

I have purchased these towels from Walmart previously and box construction was perfect.  2 cases from Amazon were misshapen, with cardboard  edges sharp and lacerated my finger.  These must be "seconds" or the quality control fork were asleep.Towels are soft & absorbent.

Missing two boxes of tissues!

Some of the hand towel boxes came smashed.

The Kleenex box pictured is not how they are configured anymore. They are in rectangular boxes which does not allow them to go on a towel rack. Please update your pictures so people know. I am disappointed that they are not the right shape anymore.

I've been buying these for quite some time.They've changed their design and quality. The boxes are smaller, the towels are smaller and everytime I grab one from the box the entire WEAK towel rips in half.C'mon, that's ridiculous!

The description for this item is 6 boxes of paper towels.  The outside packaging also says 6 boxes of paper towels.  Inside the package were only 5 boxes.

Boxes came in undamaged. ...great***update*** i subscribe so I am just unboxing my hand towels and one box is missing towels. It is sealed with nothing inside. I have missed my window for return so i just leaving a bad review. Granted this is the first time it had happened, but you want what you pay for. Times of shortages people expect to at least get their items, so one star until I get a replacement.

Really liked the pattern so I ordered them… but not what I received!

These boxes are totally ugly geometric patterns, nothing like the ones I have purchased in more neutral colors and patterns! PLUS I have had to cut my own opening in the plastic to get them out! Are these seconds?!? Absolutely hate them, and will purchase in store from now on, where I can pick my own subtle, pretty neutral boxes!

Have used a few times.  I'm sure just a manufacturing error.  One of the boxes in the case was sealed up and empty inside.  We were shorted one of the boxes inside the case.  Already pricey for the convenience so missing the product in a box was disappointing.

On the strength of the many recommendations on Amazon, I bought this item but I was disappointed when I saw the actual size of them. They are no better than a piece of regular kitchen roll paper. I don't see how anyone could identify these as being a hand towel replacement. I use two to dry my hands and will not be buying any more of this item, I've just wasted my money.

All 6 boxes were dented

As a few other reviewers have mentioned, the product itself is great, but the packaging I received is not what is shown.  I love the new colorful new Kleenex packaging, but sadly received the drab, old style boxes.  Perhaps the seller is shipping old stock first and will eventually get to the new packaging.I realize the listing states "packaging may vary", but all of the pictures shown have the new packaging.  The seller really should add some pics of the old style boxes so customers are less likely to be disappointed.

I have these on subscribe and save and was very disappointed when the latest shipment arrived. These designs are way too bold and don’t fit in with any decor in the house. I will have to come up with a new solution for disposable hand towels until they right this wrong.

The towels are great!  I just wish I received the boxes as shown when I placed the order. Yes, it does say packaging varies, but the product picture shows bright and beautiful flowers. I received drab, shaded, ugly boxes.  I was looking forward to the cheerful boxes.  Maybe advertise the dull boxes so that buyers will be pleasantly surprised when they receive the colorful ones.  Kinda deceitful marketing!

If you’re looking to brighten up a small child’s bathroom, these are great. They’re not appropriate for a room that has specific decor. The pattern is a bit extreme.

I have purchased these on subscription for years- I am now contemplating canceling because the boxes are now cartoonish colors… I really don’t want to display these😪

So disappointed in these as they have a nasty smell to them, and it takes two to dry your hands.  I used one pack and donated the rest, total waste of money.

I decided to order these through Amazon since we use these instead of a shared towel to dry our hands in the winter especially during cold and flu season... they are a bit cheaper through Amazon than my local grocery store and we are going through these like water because we wash our hands A LOT!!HOWEVER, these seem to have a stinky vinegar smell to them that I did not notice when I bought the same Kleenex towels at the local Grocery store?! I'm NOT liking this AT ALL!!! Also, the towels seem to be smaller and thinner than before?! Has anyone else noticed this??!!I guess I may be on the search for a new disposable hand towel if this is going to be the new 'downgraded' version of Kleenex paper hand towels!!!! WHY do companies ALWAYS have to ruin a good thing??Also.... The 'Betsy Johnson' or whatever this hidious black and white checkered and fluorescent pink rose designed box is HAS GOT TO GO! YUCK!!! WHO wants THAT hidious looking thing in their powder room?!?! THANKFULLY I got lucky and only received one of this ugly looking box in this pack of 6! STILL, ONE is TOO MANY!!!!Doesn't really matter anyway because these towels take your nicely fresh Smelling clean hands and turn them into STINKY VINEGAR smell after drying them with these towels!!!!!KLEENEX, WHY?? I MEAN REALLY!!!!???

I have been purchasing these for a while and if you will look at the pictures - they have shortened the length of these and if this is the new norm for the same price I will not be ordering them anymore - disappointing!!!

It does what you'd expect.  Only negative is that the boxes are like half full.  I combined two boxes just to make it feel serviceable and not devoid of towels.  Would recommend for when you have guests over, but not daily use.

do not like the flowered boxes. do not go with the room.

Absolutely HATE the new colors.  They don't match anything in our bathroom and look like Girl Scout cookie boxes.  Please bring back neutral colors.

I purchased six boxes of these "hand towels."  I opened 2 of the boxes and placed one in the kitchen and the other in the bathroom.A lady friend and her daughter were over for pizza lunch and her daughter washed up in the bathroom and her mother in the kitchen. I was waiting my turn at the sink when her daughter yelled, "Mom, these towels stink!"My lady friend raised a couple of the towels to her nose and confirmed that they did, in fact, smell unpleasant. I pulled a few towels from the box and yikes, not a good smell at all. We opened two more boxes and they had the same odor. YUK!!What's possibly worse, is that the odor transfers to your hands. Not a stretch to say that the unpleasant odor would transfer from the towel to whatever body part it came into contact with.Maybe a production issue of some sort at the manufacturing facility is the culprit, I don't know. I doubt Amazon will care, but I wanted to let my fellow Amazon Primers know of my experience (and the two young ladies experience) with these rather stinky towels.I'm sending these towels back to Amazon and we'll go back to Brawny paper towels.

too few in a box to make these economical. i knew that when i bought them tho. Delightful, soft absorbent with gorgeous boxes

Thought i was going to get the cute boxes in the product pictures with the cherries but instead got the ones with the plain outdated pattern

Why did the package design/color change.  I really do NOT like the new packaging.

Two of the Kleenex boxes were missing see the attached photograph only forward inside the box. They were all banged up. Please resend the proper amount of Kleenex towels.

I used to buy locally, boxes of these kleenex disposable paper hand towels.  I recently ordered these on Amazon, and the box is of a  lower quality, but more significantly, this paper towel smells badly after being used to dry ones hands.  This was not the case several years ago.

I was a big fan of these hand towels and would always buy some at my local Safeway until they stopped stocking them. When I found them on Amazon, I jumped at ordering them in bulk. Amazon is terrific as usual.However, these towels are much smaller than before. I didn't notice it until my girlfriend said they were not the same. I ran out to the trash and retrieved the old box for comparison. Yep, much smaller.The box has the same measurements but a different barcode.Does this mean the "old" was oversize or does the new conform to specification? I hate the idea of being duped, but this is our brave new world.Yeah for Amazon! Boo for Kimberly-Clark

I order these towels all the time,with no issue  just opened them and they stink !  Like chemicals.  Strange!

I had these hand towels on Subscribe & Save for quite a few months and have been very happy until my delivery yesterday.  These hand towels used to be BIGGER and much THICKER.  I was amazed at the high quality.  NOW...they rip when I pull them out of the box - very thin and much smaller.Don't waste your money - wash your hand towels and save.  These aren't worth it!!!Kleenex-it doesn't pay to skimp.  Consumers NOTICE!!!

This product was far below my expectations.  I have purchased Kleenex towels before and loved them.  These are stiff, with poor absorbancy and pretty awful.  Value for the money---these have almost no value to me.  If not for some scarcity during Covid pandemic, I would have returned them or thrown them away.

These are just okay.  Adults may need two to dry their hands as one gets soaked pretty quickly.  Paper towel absorbency still has them beat.  I can use Bounty Select-a-Size and get more drying using one small sheet than I do with these.  I'm still buying them though, so there's that.  LOL

Used to be great, now the quality is poor.

I ordered 2 cases of these tissues.  They were put in a big shipping box.  When I opened the shipping box one case was perfectly fine but the other was crushed.  When I opened it up the beautiful tissue boxes inside didn’t look so beautiful and couldn’t even dispense right because of the damage.

Have been using these for several years have never had any problems until this order.  2 boxes were sealed but completely empty. And others did not appear to be full.

These towels are too small and too expensive for what you get. Honestly, my 3-year-old has to use two of them. If you're really lucky, a box will last 3 days. More than one kid or a teenager and forget it.I swear the 5-star votes are coming from Kimberly-Clark employees. It's job security if people are crazy enough to buy these.

I like the product, especially now, but how does this happen! Out of 12 boxes, one was totally empty of any towels. It's ok, not expecting any response, these are good towels, but how do you end up with a sealed empty box!

These are soft and fairly absorbent but they are very small. Only slightly larger than a facial tissue. They are just too small to be useful in drying your hands. Not wanting to pull out a second towel, I leave the sink with hands still damp.  I’ll use up what I purchased but will not reorder.

This package was delivered a box within a box. But the box that holds the wipes is a dispenser and it was damaged. Therefore I had to improvise.

We've purchased this item 5 times now and all was in order. Our February order however came with an individual box that was completely empty. Its still all sealed … just nothing inside!Still trying to figure out how to get it replaced.

Disappointed that instead of six boxes in the shape/design showed that I received 3 BIG rectangular boxes that do not fit where I usually place it :(

The packaging and product have changed and not for the better. The hand towels are smaller and thinner.  They tear easily when wet and you find yourself using two where one would do previously. Still, they are handy - no pun intended.

Oh my gosh, these people thought it was a good idea to send this in a giant box that said Kleenex.  I have to carry this to my dorm room and people gave me alot of bs bit it is a good product

I buy these on Amazon Subscribe and Save, and have always sworn by them, but am probably going to cancel. The manufacturer has changed the product drastically... the box, it's not displayable in a nice bathroom anymore. Plus the quality of the actual hand towels has changed...when you pull one out it rips in little pieces in your hand. And I know this sounds weird, but whatever new paper they are using, well it stinks. As in smells bad!  I am looking for another brand to come up with something as nice as the original Kleenex Hand Towels.

We get these because my husband is into them, as a semi-germaphobe. They are thick, and easy to dispense, and the packaging is very thick and sturdy.But I recommend NOT buying these.1) they're incredibly wasteful, as far as packaging. Worst of all you don't really get that many hand towels per individ. box.2) Because of the above, they're not a great value.3) Unless you have composting, you end up simply trashing a whole lot of thick paper product just in the hand towels.

Hello. I am a return customer but just noticed that one (out of 6) of my Kleenex boxes was empty.It is sealed but has no contents inside. Help?Will change review once a response is received.

Most of the towelettes had holes in them.  I buy these for my mother in law and she is worried they are bug holes!

I just opened one of the case of 6 boxes and 5 were just fine - but one box was sealed and had nothing inside.  Not too happy with this.  So much for quality control at the Kleenex plant ☹️☹️

Very disappointed. The single sheets do not release adequately because the opening is narrower than the sheets. They tear and it often takes two sheets before you get a decent one. Thought these would be a great idea for a large party rather than towels. Useless.

I like the old towels because they were more sturdy than the new softer ones. I would like to see the old formula return.

I only received 5 boxes in the shipment not 6as advertised

Need at least two towels to get hands dry

Got a second box of this pack and found the towels to lighter than the first pack I got. It tears in my hand before I can get the towel out. It appears the quality of the product has gone down. Kleenex please get your act together especially bearing in mind that the price has also gone up.

I've used these hand towels for years and am disappointed that instead of raising the price, Kleenex had to lower the quality. The last one's I bought are about the same size and weight as their tissues.  I'm sorry to say that I won't be buying them anymore.

Need 2-3 just to wipe your hands after washing; going thru two or three boxes a week.  Gave to my son to try out in his vehicle.  Will stay with towel rolls.

well the first two times I bought these they gave me the light and dark grey colors. Apparently they put a new line in with some god awful prints from a designer Betsey.. I won't buy again cause they look ridiculous in my bathroom. that set aside if you don't care what you get the savings is good and the product is good.

They’d be great, except they smell like they were stored next to rotting meat!

Box arrived in horrible condition crushedI bought these to put out for guests. Horrible presentation.

Unfortunately all six boxes that I received are in the gray family. I was hoping for at least one box in the brown family. The length of the towels remains unchanged but the width of the is smaller by 1 1/4 " than the earlier version. The texture of the towels appear to be unchanged.

UPDATED 5/2016: I should be fair that after my bad experience with smelly, scratchy Gen 3, subsequent orders (I went back to ordering eventually because there's just no good alternative) went back to Gen 2 quality-- still nowhere near as good as the original product, but usable. I agree with others that the new gaudy boxes in the mix are a big L. On the other hand, paper companies have been foisting hideous Kleenex boxes on us for decades and we put up with that, so... meh. I can live with a box designed by--I'm guessing--some crazy scrapbook lady. I've seen worse. Those original embossed boxes were the classiest ever, though, man! Like a little minimalist sculpture on the countertop! Bring those back, K-C!*-*-*-*-There must be a bestselling business book in this mystery: why do so many companies, of all sizes, feel compelled to "fix" products that are perfect, wrecking them in the process? I find it hard to believe that I am the only consumer who would rather just pay more to get the same quality if there have been increases in material or other costs that affect the company's bottom line. Especially when we are talking about a product that is positioned as a superior, premium product in the first place.Kleenex Hand Towels are the latest victim. I've used them since they came on the market, I always paid a premium for them and I would pay a higher premium to keep the unique level of quality. No such luck.Some time earlier this year they redid the box. That was a bummer because those old embossed boxes were really swell, but that's a minor thing. The change to the towels (Generation 2) themselves at that point was pretty subtle. Not as sturdy and thick, not as much a quality feel. I didn't like it as much, but I could live with it.My most recent Subscribe and Save batch that I just cracked open is a big step down even from that first change. The towels (Generation 3) feel and look even thinner, grayer and rougher, but the big problem is the new chemical smell. Since I use these on my face, that is extremely noticeable. I have some left of the original type (Generation 1) and the type from earlier this year (Gen 2) and I compared them. I can pick out the brand new ones (Gen 3) with my eyes closed because of the strong smell. The box, SKU, etc are identical to Gen 2.I'm actually going to send these back to Amazon, although I feel bad because it's not their fault. Since Amazon is one of the few companies in America that seems to understand giving customers what they want, I am hoping that if they have to eat some returns,  they will in turn crack some skulls over at Kimberly-Clark. So I encourage those of you who agree with me to do returns as well. I am going to call the Kleenex customer service number, but we all know that won't do any good. ("In order to serve you better, we have reformulated our product. Our extensive market research shows that consumers love the new feel of Kleenex Hand Towels. Thank you for contacting us.") On the other hand, some guy at Amazon who moves a zillion dollars a year of merchandise from Kimberly-Clark yelling in their ear, that might actually get results.

I really like this product and have ordered it for a long time but, as with the tissues, my home is very neutral and these bright colors and patterns don’t match anything. Please provide both neutral and bright color options!

We’ve been buying these towels for quite a while now. They’ve always worked well and they are so much better than trying to keep up with cloth towels that have to be changed often, or deal with their sour smell. The only thing we dislike about them is the new designed boxes. They are now so “loud” that they stick out like a sore thumb on our bathroom counter. We preferred the old box design that was more conservative and better fit our bathroom decor.

The reason for the low rating is, there is quite a bit of waste when you first open the box to get it started. You loose about 5-6 towels.

Not sure who the package designers are at Kleenex but they need to rethink the tacky box designs. Surely does not match with bathroom decor outside of children's decor.

I received the product and they weren’t damaged. I was REALLY excited for the pretty fruit designs on the boxes. Sadly all the boxes I received were beige or light grey. It says “packaging may vary” but I didn’t think it would vary quite this much. I could have purchased this design locally. Still totally functional but not as fun.

These were so soft and now not soft and more scratchy

What I ordered in the first photo and what I got in the second.I know under the box the product is the same. And this product is very good. But that is not the point.So if you are ordering based on photos I urge caution.  This seems to be happening more and more at Amazon.

The new 2013 box is noticeably smaller than the previous one, which is nice for your bathroom towel rack.  However, the number of towels in a box and the length and width of the towels is the same as the old.  So how can they fit them in the smaller box?  I think they are packed a little tighter, but somehow they are not as thick as the old ones.  I say "somehow" because when I first pulled a new towel out it felt lighter, softer, and thinner than the old ones.  But when I compared them side by side, to my surprise the difference was much less...the older ones just seemed rougher to the touch but not necessarily heavier.I decided to do a strength test.  I grabbed an OLD towel in both hands in front of me (like grasping a steering wheel) and sharply and quickly stretched the towel. 3-4 times it was solid and didn't rip.  Then I tried the same test with the NEW towel.  On the second stretch both sides ripped!  I repeated the test with two more towels from the old and new, and the same result.So yes, somehow the new towels are softer and more importantly less durable.  However, I still find them acceptable for their purpose and have not had any problems with them ripping when trying to pull them from the box.  After all, it's a paper towel - don't treat it like a sheet of Kevlar.  All that being said, just like any paper towel you will still be using 2 in order to completely dry your hands.And note to Kleenex:  Yes, apparently we DID notice that tiny change you made to save a few pennies...Why do people insist on fixing things that aren't broken?

I have ordered many times before and liked  this product very much.  When I seen the new fun colors, I ordered them right away. However, the photo was misleading because I received the same old colored boxes. 😔

Good value.  These are hard for me to find in the stores.  I was not happy that some came smashed and the boxes won't stand on their own as they should.

Please bring back the geometric and gold tone box designs. They were nice, these look cheap.

Last couple orders, Kleenex Corporation has been very lacking with respect to quality of packaging. Quality Control issues! The box containing the individual boxes is crushed in with a very particular pattern completely around the box. The Kleenex are still usable but it is sad that quality control is really suffering regarding the packaging and the individual boxes are not tearing at the perforations without ripping the plastic off with it. I can tell the package issue is NOT from Amazon transporting them. It's obvious by other observations that the boxes are taped AFTER being crushed in. The taping is not creased or shows no sign of having been distorted. Also Amazon obviously doesn't package the individual boxes within. I only noticed QC issues after about 2 months into the COVID lockdowns. So I firmly believe that Quality Control has become a low priority for Kleenex Corporation. The inner boxes are damaged when the outer box is crushed while being packaged in the outer box at the factory.

This paper product is okay as it is a good paper towel for the bathrooms.  But it's very expensive.  I would  have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the price and the # of towel in a box.

I bought a case of these .Box was a dented up along with damage boxes inside case .

I needed some way for people to dry their hands in a tiny (teeny tiny....  so very very tiny) powder room in the house.  There really isn't much room for a towel bar (although now I am thinking that might have been the better way to go) and a paper towel rack would have looked pretty ridiculous, so I purchased these and I am kind of sorry I did.  The boxes are not attractive and the little (emphasis on little) hand towels are okay but nothing spectacular.  Not that I expect spectacularity from a hand towel, but these things feel a bit skimpy to me.I looked around for a dispenser that I could perhaps put the towels into to improve their appearance ( I really dislike the odd shape of the box -- I thought I would like it but seeing it up close, I don't) but I couldn't find one.  I don't think these will fit in a normal tissue dispenser, will they?BOTTOM LINE: Look, they aren't terrible but I just expect more from the kleenex brand and these fall short in my opinion.  When I finish these six boxes I will be looking for another solution.  Comment back to me if you have any good ideas.

I have purchased these in the past through Amazon and they were ok, just pretty overpriced.  But now I just ordered this six pack and when it came, there were only four inside the box, and one of them was completely smashed.  I had the issue with smashed packages before, but to be missing a third of what I paid for, especially since they're overpriced to begin with, is ridiculous.

The tissues were fine but the boxes were all bent up.

These are like double thick tissues.  These hardly qualify as paper towels.  While you can use them to dry your hands, it just seems such a waste as they don't always do the job.  Then there's the matter of how much space they take up.  Just something else to take space from your counter.  If they were a bit more decorative, that might help somewhat.  I think the main sell is the unique slant on the top of the box.  I tried them in a  towel rack upside down...  That's not very handy either... as they seem to be behind the towel bar and kept getting stuck there.  These could be used in a vehicle on a road trip for clean up a vehicle as they sit fairly well between your seat and the console... push them in.  But they're expensive for what they are...or at least I think so.  I think tissues are just as good for most everything and I'll use the towel that should be hanging on my towel bar instead of hanging one of these boxes in it's place.

I had purchased kleenex hand towels previously in the grocery store that were large and soft.  These are much cheaper.  They are not soft and are not large.  These are expensive at nearly 8 cents per towel....and not really all that different than c-fold towels that are MUCH less expensive.

OK, I really love these. They are so convenient to use, absorbent, thick, and non-shedding, and are sanitary vs the standard hand towels in home bathrooms. However, the manufacturer changed the design and color to a less-than serene appearance.  They are now very bright, with unappealing designs/colors. Please consider reverting to the prior neutral, calming tones and patterns.  I will put my Sub/Save on HOLD until then.

I place these in the bathroom. I prefer a solid color box.

I’ve ordered this a few times and I like them very much, very handy but this particular shipping box came damaged and some of the contents were damaged. I’m will keep them anyway, but not nice for putting out for guests.

These may not be the most price friendly paper towel, however they have their advantages. First the very soft and easy to grab just one with one hand.  Nice to have handy in the bathroom, kitchen, or craft area. Quality of paper towel that absorbs well and doesn’t fall apart.

A friend turned me on to these soft disposable paper towels.  The size is perfect for drying your hands after washing them.  The bonus is their softness—much softer than regular paper towels or other 3-fold disposable towels.  I find them great to use to wash my face when removing makeup. The box my friend gave me had a more subtle design, though, which I prefer, rather than the bold colors of this 6-pack set.  They are still great for your bath or kitchen!

I bought these primarily to use on my face with my Paula's choice BHA. They are definitely large enough and don't absorb too much product. The only reason for 4 stars is because they do have kind of an odd smell, but nothing bad enough to keep me from using them every day.

You don’t need to use kitchen towels. More sanitary

Very nice hand towels but too pricey. I bought them for son and grandkids visit, but I won't buy again unless price is lowered.

A little pricey but I like the idea of boxed hand towels. Great quality nice and strong.

Nice packaging but I wish you got more than 60 towels. This is strictly for guest not for even. A small family.

These can be used for everything, everywhere.  However..these extremely ugly boxes wants me to hide them taking away from the need as a quick solution!

For me, too expensive for everyday use. But would use if hosting a party at home, as it’s much more hygienic than 10-20 people (or more) sharing one hand-towel. They’re thick and absorbent, high quality. One thing that’s a bit of a pain is that it is challenging to pull one towel without pulling up on the box itself. Wish there was a heavier dispenser these could go into.

These are nice towels, sometimes I even feel bad throwing the, away after drying my hands...forcing me to find something to clean ;-)We use these towels in all our bathrooms, but they get the most use in our main/guest bathroom. They are soft but sturdy, easy to use, convenient, and most of all, SANITARY!! As the mother of 5 kids, I was always bothered by how dirty our hand towels were, those were dirt and germs being spread through my family, I was always washing hand towels(like daily), and I knew there had to be a better solution.I tried washcloths that would be used once then washed, however, you have NO IDEA how much laundry this makes in a 7person household, nor did even I have any idea how many washcloths needed to be purchased to make this a viable option. The 80 that I purchased just didnt cut it, I needed about 4-5 times that...this also requires keeping a "nice set" for company separate from the family use towels.I found a coupon for these hand towels on s&s and decided to give them a try, if I didnt like them as hand towels, I could use them for papertowels. They are perfect hand towels!! They keep everything sanitary, are soft enough to use on faces(even baby faces), and the dispenser is nice for setting on a towel rack(which is also my only complaint). I can fit 2 side by side on my bath towel rack(and have a decorative towel on my hand towel ring).These hold up well wet and dry, my 3yr old uses them to cover her eyes when washing her hair and then proceeds to use it as a washcloth, it does well. I have also grabbed them to clean bathroom messes, again, they hold up to multiple rinsings and ringings and scrubbings.I am removing a star for 2 reasons.1)the dispenser, while fitting on my towel rack, is a bit top heavy and has a tendency to topple down. I do have a narrow towel bar to wall opening, so maybe others wont have this issue.2)I wish they made a refillable dispenser, throwing away 6-8 boxes each month just seems like such a waste(yes, I know this is a small issue compared with all the towels being thrown away and yes it is all recyclable(towels and box), but still).The negatives are a fine trade off in comparison to the sanitation issues I was facing in a household of children(no matter how many times we do handwashing training, they just dont get it...but it does eventually sink in, my 14yr old is an expert hand washer now ;-))So, if you are looking for a great, recyclable, sanitary hand towel, look no further...but be aware that you will likely have the cleanest bathroom in the neighborhood as you wont be able to resist drying you hands and proceeding to wipe up the sink, mirror, door handle, etc :-)

Had to write and say when I originally did the subscribe and save  the  box design was so much better and neutral to bathroom decor.  NOT a fan of the new designs and colors 😕

I have been buying this towel for many years. Great product. Yery soft and affordable.Not so good: 1. Ordered two boxes of six. All previous orders have come packaged by Kleenex in a box of six, and I never had any damage issues. These were re-boxed by Amazon in Amazon boxes. Every one of the 12 pieces are either torn or crushed. Seems odd since Amazon double boxed these.  2. Too much of a hassle to return, so this may be my last purchase of my favorite soft paper towel if packaging is not improved.

One of my neighbors has used these disposable towels in her guest/powder bathrooms for some time, that why I decided to get them.  They are handy to use rather than a cloth towel that gets quite wet when you have multiple visitors in your home.  These towels are a better and more sanitary way for guests to dry their hands after using the bathroom.

I started using these a few years ago after my foot was amputated, I had a lot of nurses, physical therapist, and home health aids in and out of the house and didn't want them using the hand towels in my only bathroom ( I live in a Manhattan 2 bedroom 1 bath) and found they worked great with some antibacterial soap I was good to go, and I'm still in and out of the hospital and still have a lot of different people in and out of my house as well as friends. I loved the box design and it was a perfect fit for between the medicine cabinet and a shelf I have up in there and because I liked the way the white looked against the chocolate walls I removed the towels and stapled the box to the wall and replaced the towels (I tried heavy duty tape at first but it was always leaning off the wall) and I use light tape to keep the top closed. The great thing is when I want to change the box color it's easy to remove the box you just pull it from the wall and repeat the staple steps. I see a lot of people comment about the quality of the towels and while they were thicker and a little larger in the beginning you really get what you pay for and when you buy in bulk you can't really complain, when I use to get these in the supermarket they were $5.99 a box thus tax here in Manhattan and buying in bulk here on amazon they're a little under $3.00 a box so I'm not going to complain I have seen hand towels that are thicker and larger but they also cost more (45 in a pack for $5.99 and that's on Amazon, no dispenser box...you have to put them on a flat surface and for people with kids of messy other half's that could mean wet towels) Overall I enjoy the product and even use them myself from time to time I took away 1 star for changing the quality of the product  I didn't care so much about the size change. A lot of the nurses loved the Ideal and have mentioned it to some of their patients. I do hope that Kleenex continues to make this product as I hear that it now hard to find in the stores.

Container is perfect for my powder room.

Kleenex is always a good product.Kind of costly but convenient for on the go,

Wish there was a non-bleached option because I know how hard the bleaching to white is on the environment. And less expensive!

I really like the convenience and the sanitary nature of these however I've always thought they were expensive.  Basically it's a paper towel in a cute box.  But cost per sheet is much more than a tear away paper towel.  However, the box looks nicer in the bathroom and is a little more sanitary.

Boxes are hideous- must use another holder. A tad pricey

I really like these towels sand the price is great. But the colors and patterns are terrible. Doesn’t match anything in most bathroom. Would recommend more neutral colors and patterns or just solid colors.

I really love these hand towels but what I didn’t like is that they came with a different design on the boxes. I was drawn to the product because of the colorful packaging.

I always like to keep these in bathroom but was disappointed to receive the old boxes because I ordered an extra box to get new design but got the same as the first 🤷🏼‍♀️

The towels are good but they did not come in the cute designs as advertised!  I was looking forward to getting something bright for my bathrooms etc. and instead it's gold  green and gray abstract designs.  Disappointed.

If these were a bit bigger they would be a 5 star product.  But overall I do like them and will buy again.

Bathroom

Love this product Will continue to buy this item

Not a fan of new colors of boxes.

Great disposable hand towels, but the perforated opening at the top doesn’t rip cleanly, and some of the boxes I received were misshapen because of how they were glued. Need additional quality control checks

Tissues could be softer

Love it for parties use it all the timeVery popular in my home

home use

Very convenient but a little pricey

These are great to use for blowing your nose when you have allergies.

I keep these in my car, bathroom and office. Absorbent and thick

kleenex good, money spent bad. Costco has it way lower

These are a little thinner than paper towels, but the packaging makes it possible for me to prop up on a towel rack in the bathroom.  My fiance has home dialysis and we have to thoroughly wash and dry our hands with paper towels whenever we hook up and unhook him.  It's an easy alternative to putting in a paper towel rack.The problem with this order is that of the 6 boxes I received, one was sealed but completely empty!Amazon resolved the issue but the problem was probably at the Kimberly-Clark factory.  (On the bottom it was stamped " N 8 361 10:54") It was a charcoal grey colored box.I wish that Bounty paper towels, which are much sturdier, sold a version in a box like this.  I also wish these were cheaper.

Great alternative to had towels

I like this product and use it regularly in my bathrooms. I like the idea of having a clean, fresh  towel every time I wash my hands. I dislike to take hold of a towel that is already wet and somewhat soiled. Why wash your hand and then dry them with someone else's used fabric towel? I wish they were a little larger. I think most people with bigger hands would appreciate that. A box gets used up pretty quickly. The towels are nice and soft and absorbent. The Amazon price was good too. In my area the towels are usually "on sale" for $2.99 at the grocery store. At Amazon the six pack came out to be about $2.35 using Prime.I will continue to use these towels unless the price gets much higher.

I ordered these after renovating our bathroom and preparing for a large family gathering. Since my initial order of 6 boxes, I have ordered another case.Each hand towel is sufficient to dry a person's hands.  I like the ease of the dispensing one towel at a time when opening the box.  The problem comes when nearing the last 20 or so towels and they no longer 'pop up' which causes a person to dig in the box to retrieve a towel.  Despite this minor annoyance, I like the product and how it feels on my hands. It is soft and supple and has good absorption.  On occasion I have used them to take care of minor clean ups on the bathroom counter and they hold up as well as most paper towels.  I also take one into the shower with  me to wash my face each morning and they get the job done. Tney are definitely a one time use product!

I have been buying these towels for a few years now and since they are no longer available in stores I have had too buy online. Price and availability seem to fluctuate alot. I think these hand towels are a good product but with shipping costs to Canada somewhat overpriced.

The newest sheets may be a bit smaller than the originals and I am not sure about reduced thickness, but I find them useful, for example, after washing my hands prior to food preparation and I want to be sure of a sanitary drying. They are also useful as a box of "guest towels" when entertaining. Another review somewhere talked of an odor to the towels. Try as I may I can not find any objectionable odor when they are either wet or dry. New smaller box may make automatic feeding of sheets through top more reliable. Late added note after more usage: You may find yourself sometimes using two towels to dry your hands but that is not always the case. It depends on the situation of usage. Some may consider it more of an "enhanced" tissue rather than a "lighter duty" paper towel. A product you will like or maybe not but I find them useful with a reservation. Others may disagree with a four-star rating.

Have these on subscription service love them for my bathroom. Better than paper towels and more sanitary than using a hand towel.

These things are handy to have in your guest bathroom or the kids.  They are kind of pricey compared to a good roll of paper towels.  The dispenser box makes it superior to just having a big ole roll of paper towels on the bathroom counter.  If you dont want to share bathroom germs with your guests then get these.  I keep a box in my kids bathroom and our guest bathroom.  I am so grossed out about sharing a community towel with everyone.  No thanks.

I used these disposable hand towels in both of my bathrooms long before the pandemic for sanitation purposes as I don't feel cloth towels are sanitary, & I don't have a hand dryer. They could increase their marketability by decreasing the cost.

I love everything about this item the only con is you have to use 2 hands as box lifts up. A hard cover would make it perfect!

I'm on the auto delivery plan with these great towels.  Great for guests, makeup and soft on nose.  One problem, I was getting the plan box design, now they're sending the most ugly designs I've ever seen.  They look like they came out of the 60's.  Who thinks up this crap.  Whoever came up with and whomever approved these patterns have the worst taste ever.  I'm going to cancel my auto shipment till they come to their senses.  They didn't ask for stars on design which would be a minute 5, but I can't knock the actual hand towel they're great.

I really appreciate this product for drying hands and sometimes for cleaning, but the price is a deal breaker if it goes above 10-12$ it's not worth it just bye some paper towels, because a box last a week and I have 2 bathrooms so a box of 6 don't last a month,and your paying for the box more than the towels, I'm thinking about investing in the wall unit that you get 1000+ towels same or better quality for 20$ the investment is the wall unit,kinda like the good hand soap with the wall unit, but in the long run it will be cheaper,they sell them hear on Amazon!

I love how easy these are to use for guests and feel they are worth the value for everyone to have a clean hand towel. The absorb water on your hands great, and are soft to the touch! I love the variety of box colors as well!

I recently purchased the Kleenex towels and I am very impressed with their performance. The towels are strong and absorbent, making them perfect for cleaning up spills or drying hands. I also love that they are disposable, making clean up quick and easy. The packaging is convenient and fits well in my bathroom. Overall, I highly recommend these towels for anyone looking for a reliable and durable option. Now I have an Amazon subscription on these .

I'm intrigued by the comments about how they used to be better because I think that the current product (purchased for the first time about 6 weeks ago, just reordered) is pretty great.  I think it might depend on what your intended use for them is.  I purchased them for blotting my face dry after washing it.  I have very sensitive/reactive skin that is prone to redness, acne, dryness, dermatitis, etc. and realized that reusing a cloth towel to dry off with might not have been the best idea in terms of bacteria.  I started using normal paper towel (roll) to blot dry but storing it in my bathroom was inconvenient, which is what makes these so great.  I don't have a towel bar/rack in my bathroom (hooks and a ring instead) so I can't do the upside down dispenser method as pictured.  I have a narrow storage tower with shelves, so I put these on a shelf horizontally (dispensing end out, obviously) under a box of cosmetics.  This is a great set-up for me since they take up very little extra space this way and are conveniently within reach.  The towels themselves are nice and soft, as well as fairly absorbent and strong (comparable to Viva, probably not quite as strong but a little softer which is nice for facial use).  After gently blotting my face dry, I dry my hands with the same towel before applying toner and moisturize.  Honestly, the only downside for me is that they're a little too convenient!  I bought them for the use described above, but have ended up with a box in every room (except for the kitchen/living area where I have a roll dispenser).  They make good napkins and even a decent tissue in a pinch.  They're a bit pricey (and small) to use for cleaning in my opinion, so I'm going to try to be a little more strict about my usage of them for other purposes this time around.  But that's probably not going to go very well since they really are incredibly convenient.

Best replacement for those expensive auto-order face towels.  (you know the ones I'm talking about) These feel the same, maybe even better, at a fraction of the cost.  Not to mention, but they also come in a cute, jaunty box.Great for guest bathrooms where no one is sure if they count as the guest who is actually allowed to use the guest towels that we're all saving for that unexpected visit by the princess of Wales. Use them, toss them.  Life is good.  No more washing extra towels to keep your face clean; no more guessing if you're qualified to use guest towels.  Fun for everyone!

I have a family child care and I buy these monthly, Amazon has the best price!  The hand towels works for my little people after they are done washing their hands. The water absorbs well and will always be my go to.

Strong, efficient, convenient, adorable, space saving, impeccable cleaning ability, soft, and best of all it doesn't leave any fibers or residue behind! I am in love with this product; thank you for this amazing towel!

Perfect product for guest room. Nice absorbency. Looks nice.  Can sit on counter,  or hang upside down on towel bar.Good price, and value.

These are much more hygienic than using the gross towel on a hook in your bathroom to dry your hands. I have one box in my bathroom and one by the kitchen sink. They’re durable and one is enough to dry both hands completely. These are essential especially when dealing with raw meat in the kitchen. I no longer use paper towels to dry off my hands, only these. I also keep a couple towels in my purse, in case I ever have to use a public bathroom and the bathroom doesn’t have paper towels, or I use these as a disposable handkerchief. I can’t recommend these enough!

Love these great way to stop the spread of germs in a bathroom kitchen or a bedroom. They  bb are n thick individual napkins like.

I love these hand towels. They are thick and absorbent.

Perfect to elevate any bathroom. Still disposable and easy to use but it looks prettier!

I use way to many because of the convenience but that’s on a good note. You can’t find these in stores around me so I buy these all the time from Amazon

I use these in our Cape vacation home. I keep a box in each bathroom. Every person gets a nice clean towel to use after washing their hands.

I love these towels to keep in the bathroom, my guest’s also liked these. More sanitary then putting a hand towel that everyone uses. No washing just throw away. Soft and strong.

Bought these to use during a party.  One in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  Really absorbent and picked up spills quickly.  Easier and quicker to use than pulling off of a roll. Also, box was pretty.  Would like to see designs with muted colors and patterns.

These make great guest towels for the bathroom. It keeps your guest from using your show towel’s

We have them in every car. Think of these as something tougher than a Kleenex, and in a more convenient package than a roll of bounty. Yeah, you can use them as hand towels, but in a pinch you can use them to clean a small mess too.

I pull these out at gatherings when a hand towel is gross by the 4th bathroom break and leaves people drying their hands on a wet towel. Keep a couple on hand and pull out for guests!

I like to have these in the bathroom when guests are over. Keeps the towels from getting soggy & no germ sharing

Use these in bathrooms in my salon, very thick and absorbing and cute patterns on box

So great in the guest bathroom, I now longer have to wash my good towels every time I have guest or grandkids stop by.

Perfect size for the car

I love having these towels in my bathroom. They insure you don’t get someone else’s germs. My hands feel very fresh and clean after using them.

I keep a box in my bathroom for guests. They are good for not spreading germs.

Nice for small bathroom with no place to hang hand towels

I use these in my bathroom, kitchen, garage and car. Really love them. I took 1 box to my brother in nursing home and he likes it better than regular Kleenex or Puffs ,- much more sturdier

These hand towels are pretty thick. Have bought a few times.

These can be hung upside down behind a towel rack.Much easier than having many hand towels.

The subject hand towels are convenient to use and effective for drying hand’s especially in bathrooms. Box is pretty for use in bathrooms.

THESE HANG ON MY TOWEL RACK AND I CAN PULL ONE OUT AT A TIME

Very absorbent and easy to dispense.  I hang a box from a towel rack next to the sink.

I recently added these to my skin care, instead of using a face cloth and washing it every couple times. My skin has definitely cleared up!

We love these bathroom hand towels. We've been using them for years now. We still have hand towels by the sinks but the paper towels are more convenient for us. Our daughter first started using them at her condo since she's not home much and laundry is a bigger chore for her.We found it cost effective and a better use of our time to use these towel dispensers at our house. One thing about this product is consistency. Some products change and then change again. Not the same with paper hand towels. This is a good product at a fair price and having it arrive on a schedule is first rate.

Excellent product/good price

Nice to have instead of everyone using the same hand towel. Just makes sense from a practical standpoint

I love these kleenex towels. I used to buy them at cvs but now I buy them on Amazon by the case. I keep a box in all of the bathrooms. Best quality paper towels and the boxes have pretty designs. I love that they give you a variety.

Hey, they are definitely a splurge. Regardless, you cannot beat these for convenience. They are so soft, and at the same time, surprisingly strong. Perfect for face washing or drying, my favorite uses.I keep these out for guest towels, too. The boxes are attractive, and the disposable aspect makes guests comfortable. No icky germs from hand towels!I have these on regular delivery. If you like them, too, I recommend that. It’s nice never to be out of supply at home.

Perfect to dry you hands and wipe sink down and throw away. Nice and thick and only need one for the job.

These fit perfectly in the door of my car so I use at least 4 in each!  Best napkins out there!!!

These single-use facial towels are so soft and absorbent! Stop using all multi-use cloth towels!!You can set them on the sink or sit them on top of the towel rack to dispense downward without any effort.This is my second purchase and will be buying more!

A little pricey but a nice addition to the bathroom. I hope my guests know it’s ok to use them.  they didn’t want to use my other decorative paper towels because they were too pretty LOL

I keep these in the bathroom for visitors so they don't have to use it the same hand towel.  Prevents messes around the sink.  Very convenient and clean.

Great for the bathroom, love the different color boxes. Easy to use, great performance

We use these in the bathroom closest to the outside door.  After working in the garden, the last thing I want to do is to use my wife’s nice cloth hand towels. These work wonderfully well! They are strong, yet soft. Not crazy about the box’s imprinted design, but they are just what I need!

I ordered these for both sets of grandchildren to teach them to use a clean towel each time they wash their hands. Flus and viruses were rampant in their elementary schools, so I thought this would be a good tool for them to wipe their hands after each hand wash or tooth brushing without using the same towel over and over. They are good hand washers, but use the same hand towel over and over, or until mom changes it. I’m hoping to make it easy and fun for them by using these towels and that they create good hygiene habits.

This product is sturdy, easy to use and it’s nice to sit on a towel rack for the ease of use. The absorption is good.

I like the towels. It saves using cloth towels especially with guests. I like that it is one use and throw away. My issue is the box needs to be heavier to pull out the towels. I need to find an enclosure or some weight to put at the bottom. when pulling a towel sometimes the box lifts up.

These are wonderful paper towels for applying face creams and lotions, toners and liquids (I cut the towel in 9 squares for these), holds up to basic cleaning and just a great disposable hand towel.They do not fall apart when when cleaning the sink, wiping the mirrors or the other bath fixtures.I was concerned for a time that they had stop making them,  I was having a hard time finding them in the stores. So thank you Amazon Seller

Excellent clean absorbing perfect for powder room sink will never be without them

Napkin quality, absorbent. I always buy white napkins; they're more elegant.

I chose this brand on a wim and I am so happy with them. They are fairly thick and economical, unlike other cheap, flimsy napkin brands. And I like this: Forestry practicesMade with materials from well-managed forests, recycled materials, and/or other controlled wood sources.As certified by The Forest Stewardship CouncilClimate Pledge FriendlyDiscover more products with sustainability features.

These Bounty Paper Napkins are every bit as good as their paper towels, which we also use.  I've tried other brands of napkins and paper towels and have always returned to the Bounty brand.  These are very absorbent and like little mini paper towels.  I also frequently use them instead of tissues.  They are softer than the texture of Bounty Paper Towels and don't have the lint that some tissues have.  Bounty may not be the least expensive brand but, as they say, you get what you pay for!

These napkins are great they come in a bag of 2. I thought they would be thick like a bounty paper towel but they are surprisingly not so thick. But they are not flimsy and thin either. Perfect to use at the dinner table or parties.  They are just right. Definitely would buy again. It was a great value for the price!

I only use this brand because of the quality, appearance, and durability. They are soft, yet clean up nicely without ripping.

Price is right. Napkins are of decent quality.

I have used Bounty for decades and years ago when they started offering napkins, I got them at a warehouse club. I am happy that Amazon carries them now and the price is great as is the delivery service.They are very durable, fit well in all my napkin holders and do last longer than the cheaper\thinner brands.

You cannot go wrong with purchasing this value. There are a lot of napkins for the money. I love these napkins. They always work good and very absorbent would definitely buy it again for the price.

I use these as dinner napkins, and they do exactly what they're supposed to! They are the perfect size and absorbency for my needs, making them great for every meal. I’ve purchased these several times now, and I’ll definitely continue to do so. Their quality and reliability make them a staple in my kitchen, and I love how they enhance my dining experience!

Buyed many times here.

Really bad smell！

Cheap paper napkins. Not really packaged well. Not a premium product like their paper towels. Buy Vanity Fair.

This item arrived to me completely open. God only knows who and what touched the napkins.  This unacceptable! :(

The napkins are very poor quality as soon as I go to wipe up water it tears into piecesThey never were like this beforeShame on them taking cheaper ways to save money in return they are misleading there customersI will never buy this product again

Huge pack of napkins. Probably takes up at least 1/3 of the box.

I have considered myself a Bounty napkin and paper towel snob--willing to pay more money for great quality.  However, I have no idea what happened to the napkins -- they are no better than a generic brand I can get anywhere.  I'm so disappointed and have several packs that I'm ready to return.  Paper towels seem to be okay.  I also recognize that toilet paper has, in fact, become narrower.  How stupid do these companies think we are.  I'm sooooo disappointed.

paper thin please dont get this, vanity is better

This package of napkins turned out to be NOT quilted and not very absorbent so you need 2 instead of one. My error I guess. I would have bought and paid for the really discounted brand if I wanted this kind of quality.

Be sure to look at the product image not just the description!  The product description plainly says the napkins are “2-ply”, but the image of the package says 1-ply. They are in fact 1-ply. Not the great bargain they would appear to be.

I have use Bounty napkins for years and this last order is poor quality. It is very cheap feeling. I will cancel all future monthly orders.  I will have to choose a different brand. Sad. 8/1/24

Good

These napkins are no better than a store brand.

Awfully thin. . .

I initially thought this was rolls. I should have read product description. but I still don't like square napkins. personal preference

Bounty napkins smell sour. It's not just me, other ppl using these noticed it, too.

Not a soft napkin.  I will not get these again because of the way they feel on your face

They used to be softer and I thought 2 ply. Now they seem and feel like a folded over paper towel. Disappointing.

It's just paper towels pre-ripped and bent in half.  Not worth the upcharge.

Very dry rag type napkin , first time I have used or bought. I will not buy again! Absolutely no comparison to Vanity Fair Napkins

These are a cheap quality. I will go back to buying deluxe ones from Sam's Club. But we have to get through these first. I was surprised as Bounty paper towels are superb.

Our household has used Bounty products for years with no complaints, but now I have seen a downturn in quality.  The napkins are thinner and are rough to delicate skin around mouth and lips when used for wiping.  I am disappointed in what used to be a top product.

Too small

I ordered towels, but got napkins. Too bad

Too thin. Paper towels are better.

This was way too much money to buy. I won’t be buying it again from here.

Use for Kleenex

I was surprised by how thin and small these are, I think because I was expecting something closer to Bounty paper towels. These are at least soft, as so many thin napkins are not - but there isn't much here.Will try using them for now until I can find something better, but don't plan to buy them again.

I have been buying this product a long time originally from Ralph’s market. The softness of the product has been wonderful; however  that quality is not always available on every order  with Amazon.

The picture shows a label saying the size is a generous 12x12 inches, a great dinner napkin. Except, that's not quite right. It is 12x12 folded in quarters, so the real napkin is just 6" x 6" in size, making it more like one sheet of paper towel. Hady to pack with lunch sandwiches maybe, but too small to be of any use at the dinner table. It may be that great Bounty quality, but really? Six inches is all?

Good go-to napkins.  Not really a good absorbency, but good for sticky fingers and holding on to a donut, or other snack. For the price they are very good. I use them several times a day for a quick mouth wipe, coffee cups on tables, catch all for cookie crumbs, etc. A little more classy than using a paper towel for these sorts.

Not that many for the price. I thought I'd be getting a box or bag of these napkins. It's a single bag. They are as absorbent as any restaurant napkin. I'll use these but wont buy them again

I expected these to be tough like the paper towels. Not so. They're very flimsy napkins like the cheap grocery store brands. I preferred the  Vanity Fair brand but they seem to be out of  them.

I just needed clean, cheap, thin, napkins for every day snacks.  This product works well for that purpose.  Nothing amazing, just simple.

Arrive on time. . . . AQuality of product. . .C-Final Grade: . . . . .B

Gift

Over priced is why I gave it three stars.  Not the greatest napkins I have ever used.  Not worth the money.

They are adequate.....quite thin and surely not too soft, but as a napkin....I guess they do the job.

These are okay as napkins go. For decades I used Mardi Gras napkins for the low cost and purpose. I cannot find those any longer. So these are you average napkins. The size is right.

Ok for the price. Not soft or very absorbent

Poor quality

Not super strong but okay for everyday needs

Not soo soft

Good

Good price

They are very good & strong

Can buy in bulk

I really like the napkins, however the value for what you get is a bit high.

Very good product the price is reasonable

Just like most things I notice these days, it seems the quality has somewhat took a hit with these. They definitely are not as thick or as absorbent. I will continue to use them, as they are better than most others out there.

We use for every day

I know, silly. But these are much cheaper than at the market and do the job.My only complaint? Someone at Amazon used a razor knife to open the carton so all my napkins have a slice through all of them! Random, but annoying.

I can't vouch for it being the quicker picker upper but I can tell you I have a house load of cats and it handles everything they throw at me.  I use two to three of these a month and can't live without\ them now.  No other paper towel stands up to the task.

Package was fine but put on front lawn instead of porch blew into street...please deliver packages to front porch

Good deal, comes in 2 packs of 200, which is easier to fit in cabinet, good napkins.

One napkin does the work of several

Good!

price is right and i didn't have to cost to wally world, m y life is good!

Good quality and does what they're supposed to do!

Work

These napkins were great for wiping my mouth and hands during and after my meal.

good product

It's paper napkins...love is not a word I would use to describe the product. It does the job and the cost is exceptional. Bounty is a good product

Great

Good product,

These could be more absorbent, I always feel like I use the whole roll on any mess. With a dog, these are a lifesaver.

We like these but they are a compromise. They are a good buy but they are not the softest or most absorbent you can buy.

Very convenient to be able to have this delivered.  Classic bounty quality in bulk.

To be honest, I don't know why I bought these, we keep forgetting we have them .__. but they work well.

Everything ok  no problems

I'm sold will be buying more

Needs more more modern designs

Nice napkins and gets the job done.

Sturdy, durable napkins!

Have not used them as yet, but I trust Bounty.

No problems

Price is good.

they are great for everyday use

These are good to have instead of other regular napkins.

thick, soft, truly soaks up those little spills well

none

Value for money!

Excellent quality

Large enough for a house of 2 to not have to worry about being low on napkins for a long time and decent quality.

Good for everyday use , we love the color and softness.

The best napkins for adults, children’s spills and puppy dog drools.

It’s so easy to order on line and arrives in a few days sometimes overnight. Perfect for me.

As expected

I like itI bought many times from walmartNow i order from amazon, it's the same quality and really good

BOUNTY IS THE BEST

This is the only brand I buy.

These napkins are great quality and I always have a few packs on hand.

Still the best!

These do not fall apart or shred when used

Bounty napkins are my favorite napkins. I love that the Tupac on Amazon is cheaper than you can get in a store and it’s cheaper than if you only buy one at a time. Bounty napkins are very absorbent. They don’t rip very easy and I use them all the time.

Great value

The cost of napkins is ridiculous but we do use them. These were the right price

This is a regular item.

I like the product, it has a good price and fast shipping.

These are a good value for the price. They are good napkins and love that I could buy in bulk

These napkins work and get the job done. They aren’t anything specifically fantastic about them but they work. In our local stores in CA they are double the price than I get here on Amazon. So I always order them! Thank you for providing great deals on here!

Works great

Great Quality Great Product, Great Price,  These are Easy-to-use and they Work Fantastic

These are the best napkins, a little thicker, soft and more absorbent. Not slippery and thin like some other brands.

Will buy again!

They're Bounty so I don't need to say much moreSoft and absorbent

Top quality, I always buy this regardless of price. It's sturdy and doesn't break even when it's fully soaked.

Bounty napkins are my favorite napkins, absorbent, they don’t fall apart, the price is fair….

I’ve used Bounty paper napkins for the past three or more years. I was pleasantly surprised by the thickness and quality of the napkins.  I use them daily to wipe hands and faces along with my poodles beard. I have even used them to clean small messes off the floor. I found Amazon’s price was far better than other stores and hope Amazon is able to continue their prices. If anyone is on the fence they need to jump off and give Bounty paper napkins a try.

We were running out of all the extra napkins we had from fast food visits lol. So we needed to restock. And went with these Bounty ones. They do the job.

These napkins are a staple on my kitchen table.They absorb well. The price here is not bad. With a large family we go through a lot of them over time...getting this huge package saves me extra trips to the store...FIVE STARS*****

Good buy.

Excellent napkins

These napkins are soft,absorbent, good size and great value 👍

I bought these because of the price and the $15 promotional credit . But thought they would be cheap napkins especially for the price. But they were better than I thought they would be. Their not the greatest like others that you will pay 3 times the price for. But for everyday usage they are prefect. Slightly better than the 250 count cheap napkins you find every else. I would definitely buy these again but it will be a while as I bought 4 boxes of the 400 count. (:-)

I've been using paper towels that mimic Bounty.  When I tried these, because they were the only option I felt I had, I could tell the difference right away. The paper towels were thicker and absorbed more than the other paper towels.

no problem with the product at all

This is the first time I bought these napkins and it will not be the last.They are super absorbent, soft and durable. Cleans up better than most paper towels do.

Good deal for the price

I’m very sad tidied with the product.

Packaged well. I mean they are napkins what more can I say lol. They weren't smashed lol

Doesn’t fall apart, good wiping ability, nice size

A Bounty napkin will outlast any of the cheaper napkins. I have used these for years and I never throw them away till they are used up and then some. Good value.

It burns in the oven and air fryer. I requested for returned.

this stuff is completely water resistant and that is not okay for the purposes I needed it for. Nowhere on the package was it stated that it was coated with anything and that is exactly why I purchased it. I need a parchment that can leach away water.Also, the package is weak as hell and was easily torn while trying to cut a piece of the paper off with the dullest cutting edge ever. I resorted to using scissors for a straight cut.Fortunately, I can use this when my other silicone paper runs out, but that is not why I bought this stuff. Not so much false advertising as a general lack of information, but still really really annoying.

Rice was everywhere in the package.

About half of these arrive in an unusable dispenser box - it can't be glued all that well. Even worse when Amazon decides to put it in a paper envelope.It is the right width for a half sheet pan without folding or cutting.

Product was opened upon receipt.  Not just opened but box was worn and torn as if it came out of someone’s recycling bin.  Parchment paper looks okay, but how do I know it is Reynolds and not some lower quality paper put into a Reynolds box.

Paper is great.Shipper is not good. Second time I've ordered this. Box gets bent and/or crushed in the envelope.Next time this happens, I will return it until I get one that is undamaged.

This item showed up with a box along with a box that holds parchment paper. However, there was no parchment paper actually in the box. How does that happen?

I like to use parchment paper when I broil or bake as it makes for easy clean up. This brand curled up and burned. I’m tossing it & already ordered my previous brand.

Ordered twice. both times the box was completely destroyed. Here are the photos from the second order. Aside from having no way to dispense this the 12 inch size fits well on a baking sheet without extra waste.

I ordered parchment paper a nd the roll had been clearly opened and taped shut.  The flap also had water damage on it and paper worn away from the water damage, yuck!

It showed up already opened and the box was worn. Do not buy

There is no parchment paper inside. Would like to refund or re-send it

Just received, and it's an opened and returned package by someone else.  It's very disturbing to receive an already opened kitchen product, specially under such pandemic circumstance.

Fraud - the box is open and inside was not Reynolds parchment paper but some other cheap paper. Do not buy!

Package was open and only one roll was received.  The roll was broken down and flat would never order again.

The product came damaged and completely opened at ribs in the paper

Horrible. No support in the middle (cardboard). Only the parchment paper and it falls apart every time.... Whyyy

The package came opened and used!! Awful

Box came ripped open.  Can’t use it now.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Open it up and is greeted with a bug............

The product was opened and was in a bad condition. Very disappointed.

Arrived with original box damaged and opened.

Too thin leakage

Ok

Damaged

Oddly, things keep sticking!

I refuse to buy Reynolds branded parchment paper. They removed the center cardboard roll so now it is impossible to cut the paper using the sharp edge of the box. And Reynolds company, please do not tell me that consumer demand or a desire to save the environment caused you to remove the center roll. Doing that may have saved the Company but think about the customers who you have lost.

As far as parchment paper goes, it works just fine. Non-stick and all that. BUT, tearing a piece out of the box is horrendous. It just as well tears along the cutter of the box as well as it randomly tears wherever, so you end up with raggedy pieces each time. I've used other brands that tear from the box just fine.

NOT SAFE TO USE. WILL CAUSE FIRE

The package was broken when arrived. I did not return it for few dollars but its a hygiene issue.

Sticks with food totally waste of money

One of the parchment paper was ripped/open from the side. 😒

Have to keep peeling off roll

I have never had an issue before, but this last order had defective parchment paper. Pretty much wasted tons of the rolls trying to either get the wax off or cut around it. Disappointed. I use parchment paper for tons of things. I’ve never had this issue  before.

Trying to be understanding that the parchment paper itself seems to be in new condition; however, you really never know what to expect when the packaging of the product looks to have been tampered with. If the item was not kitchen-use-related, I wouldn't be too worried, but the fact that I would be using this with food makes me a little worried, just not knowing who / what had previously come in contact with the parchment paper itself..

Really? Is this a Reynolds product?  Shabby outer box, already tore at one end. The parchment paper is very thin.  I do not believe it is by the Reynolds company I've used for 50 years.

Doesn't work with any Ikea or similar kitchen containers because it is 2 inches shorter and constantly loosens to create an issue when attempting to pull it out for cutting. It doesn't pull out and I have to take it out of the storage unit, tighten up the roll, put it back and then quickly unroll and cut.

About half way through this roll all of a sudden there were jagged cuts in the paper that went on for about 5 feet. I couldn’t use that portion of the roll. It seems like a manufacturing defect.

This package was ripped to shreds and look like it went through the Ape House at the St. Louis Zoo. I have to tear off at least a foot of the parchment paper to get it back to a decent useable length.

good product byt came crushed

The cutting system on this box is more of a pain that it is helpful.  The roll doesn't move easily, so trying to wrap an item can be tough unless you pull out more saran wrap than you need.  I would not buy this kind again.

It's parchment paper.Low review because the tear off strip is the WORST.I either fight w it and wind up with a ragged mess or go get the scissors.

Very thin parchment .. not as thick as when I purchased in store with the same brand

I didn't expect to receive a package like this.......looks like it is a used one.

This thing is hard to cut,we use is very hard.

Not so well. By the time it was received, the box was broken.

flimsy and way overpriced, get better at the dollar store

Mine came dent so was not easy to use

Package was open and torn

Works well but it went on fire in my convectional oven at 400 degrees. Luckily I was watching. Please be careful while using

Cut my fingers

The paper is loosely rolled without a middle pole. It is hard to roll the rest of the paper back.

This roll does not have that handy grid for measuring the length you need. Prefer the one from the grocery store. Same price.

The fact that the sheets are narrower isn't a benefit. What a pain when pizza sauce leaks underneath: (

I washed it up and used it. It used to be working OK. But I am surprised it was not checked before shipment to make sure it was clean when it was sent.

I don’t like the size and design of the parchment paper. It’s thin and has no guide grids! It’s different from the same brand I bought in grocery store. I don’t recommend!

I love using this product it's so easy for baking cookies and everyting else in the oven and saves on dishes.  Unfortunately both boxes I ordered arrived with a broken seal, won't return because I;ll use these two for crafting purposes.  If I were using or cooking purposes I would return!

Great product. Just a smaller package than I had expected. I probably should have read the description better myself. Otherwise, the product performs great.

The product is fine but the "cutter" does not exist....  it is pretty annoying to have cut a sheet when there should be a cutting edge

This paper is super thin compared to the last parchment paper I purchased (no, I can't remember the brand).  So far, I will keep it because I am using it for separating small pieces of frozen items.  I haven't checked yet to see how well this paper will NOT stick to the food items.  IF it does not work well, I will be returning.

This paper came in a roll inside of an already "opened old" box. I can tell the box has been re-used or was very very old as it had discoloration and lots of creases, bend marks..This was not a new package for sure. The paper was in a roll and held together by one strip of grey tape. Will not order this product online again.

Too wide for sheet pans. It's annoying to have to cut it down to a standard sizes cookie pan each time. Other than that, it's really good parchment. I can reuse a sheet for three batches of cookies. I bake a lot and despise clean up. This takes away that time consuming step.

Having this delivered made it worth the extra cost this time.  The box arrived crushed and it won't unroll very well but it's only parchment paper, right?  No big whoop.  My first batch of cookies came out fine so we're good.

The parchment paper itself was undamaged but the box was smashed, bigly. Ever try using this without the box and cutting edge? Not fun.

Pros: Paper is strong, cooks cookies well and is economical.Cons:  Have to take time to cut it to fit the pan. Cookies burn if same sheet is used more than three times.

it useful for me, I try bake for my son, But I didn’t like when I open packages, it also has opened!

Did the work as described, is it a little bit too thin ?

The roll is too narrow to cover a half pan cookie sheet. The roll is quite small.

Product is good, I know. Because, I have used before.But the packages is bad. When I opened it, it had already broaken...

The box was open. I hope this is not a returner item!

needed to be wider

Arrived damaged.

Product was intact but, box was torn on both sides.

This is decent parchment paper, it works well in the oven. MY issue with it is that it tends to be difficult to year in a straight line from the roll. Although, this is easier to tear straight than the wider style rolls. It would be beneficial if there was a cutting edge to assist in tearing straight.

Good parchment paper, but for the price, I was expecting a bigger box. My fault for not paying attention to the length. The same box and brand is a few dollars cheaper at the dollar store.

The quality was fine but not as good as others I have tried.Parchment paper has been so difficult to find in my local grocery store since March I was happy to find some online!

Pretty standard product.  Nice to have the measure squares delineated to help judge portions.

Yo know it’s parchment paper just over priced

A bit disappointing

Good paper but the tear off strip is worthless...we use scissors.

I cut needed squares for pre-making hamburgers, breakfast sausages.I now buy round ham from Aldi's. Cut open the package and cut the parchment paper for each one. Then I freeze them. It's the only way to grab 2 when needed, instead of defrosting them all each time

Have come to love using this stuff. Way better than spraying pressurized oil in pans or using silpat liners.The problem is the shipping method resulted in a smooshed flat package jammed into my mailbox.The box that is supposed to dispense the paper is unusable. Thankfully I had the box from a previous order and could transfer the roll. But what if I hadn't still had a couple feet left?Love the product, NOT the shipping process.

Really like this when used for a pan lining when baking. Also like the lines that help with creasing edges to heel the food in place.

I have use this brand before and it serve the purpose

Very good n non stick! Reasonable price as well!

This is good parchment paper, But I bought the smaller size by mistake (12 " instead of 15"). Not a bigissue but the longer width works much better for me.

Loved it and what is surprising, that it lasted for a lone time

always buy this brand! Really enjoy how easy it is to use and then toss when ready. If only delivery drivers wouldn't be so rough, had to throw away too many boxes to count.

I love this better than wax paper. Great to cook with or roll out dough or lay your cookie/ cake decorations on to dry.

The media could not be loaded.
                



This paper is easy to use and we use it a lot in the oven to cook chicken nuggets and chicken wings. Basically, just lay the paper in the oven, then put chicken nuggets on it, then turn on the oven, that’s it. The paper feels a little oily, and it doesn’t stick. Like it so far.

Seems like what you'd expect from parchment paper. However, it did arrive in a box that was already opened (concerning) and the box was kind of mangled. The seal on the roll was intact so I will still use it. I'm not going to send it back solely because of that...but the OCD person in my brain is screaming because my clingfilm and aluminum foil boxes look so well kept and then I have this mangy old box. I guess I will have to not be lazy and just buy it at the grocery store next time :P

Parchment paper is wonderful for Bakers. It prevents sticking in the pans and makes it easier to clean your pans. The only problem I have is when you tear some from the roll it tends to want to curl up. That can make it difficult to cut 2 size. It is worth the difficulty.

Well there’s nothing wrong with this parchment paper except I thought I was getting a longer width. On the other hand, it’s the right with for an average cookie sheet. Just pay attention to the dimensions if you care and are wanting the really big wide parchment roll.

I use this but ,had no idea it would go on fire in the oven. Thank God I was nearby

Parchment paper definitely beats greasing. I wish it was easier to tear straight and would lay flat while I dropped cookies on it but overall worth the money.

Pricy, but it has performed well for homemade pizza, cookies, and the like. Held up to meatloaf cooking on it while keeping grease from my baking sheet. This makes clean up easier!

Quality parchment but difficult to tear off to use.

Great liner for all types of oven wear. Makes clean up easier

Delivered on time and as described

The only prob...it was kinda of a pain to use because of roll. Doesnt want to lay flat.

If you're baking you need parchment paper. Love the cutting edge on this product, no crazy ragged edges.

Works well

Works well though a little thin.

Good product, fast delivery, safe choice.

Good

I like it for baking etc.easy clean up.

Would buy again

Good paper, met expectation.

Great

Good

Good overall

Reynolds offers parchment paper in several forms, including pre-cut 12 "x 16" Cookie Baking Sheets, 15-inch paper rolls with SmartGrid, and this 60-foot roll of 12-inch wide parchment. No matter the packaging, the parchment paper is all good, reusable up to four times in the oven, and able to withstand temperatures to 425ºF. The paper is made in France from wood pulp fibers and packaged in the USA. Reynolds doesn't say what it's coated with. The selling point of this 12-inch roll of parchment is its width. If you have baking sheets that are a little wider than 12 inches, this will fit perfectly and may save you time and money, as you won't have to cut it.My baking pans are narrower, however, so the 15-inch-wide, 36-foot-long rolls work better for me, and a like the SmartGrid feature, not available on the 12-inch paper, which is a grid printed on the paper that helps me cut a straight line. I mostly use parchment for baking meringues and chips made from various greens, especially those that tend to flatten out when baked, like radish or beet greens. When I make meringues, I cut the parchment after baking to put between the layers of meringues in my storage container. Parchment can also be used to steam fish in the oven or to wrap hard cheeses for storage. It's non-stick and heat-resistant, so it has many uses. The serrated metal cutter on the box works well enough.

Bleached and unbleached parchment paper can be used for all the same tasks, they have a fundamental difference that sets them apart. The first notable difference in these two types of parchment papers is their color. As you'd expect from the name, bleached parchment is white, while unbleached parchment is brown. This is because unbleached parchment paper is untreated and fully chlorine-free, while its bleached counterpart is treated with chlorine which gives of the white color. The two most common parchment paper coatings are silicone and Quilon. Quilon is cheaper but can't be used multiple times and it has a much lower max bake temp (about 375). Silicone is more expensive and can be used multiple times up to the stated temperatures. Although the width is 12 inches you can find larger sizes to accommodate larger width cookie sheets. I like the fact thats it’s chlorine and quilon free and fully compostable. I took one star off due to the width.

I have a small oven and use small baking sheets, so this parchment paper is the perfect size. We're very basic with our cooking, so this parchment paper works great for our needs. It's not too thin or flimsy and keeps our baking sheets nice and clean whether we're baking fish or cookies.

Great for reducing kitchen mess. Great alternative cooking liner to aluminum foil. Be careful to cut edges for liner to stay inside of the pan. It can catch fire but that is easy to avoid.

I have used bleached parchment paper forever, but I really prefer that it is now available in an unbleached format.  This is a bit thinner than the precut sheets I have previously used but the rolls are much more versatile.  These are perfect for lining bread pans as well as cookie sheets.  I can cut exactly what I need without waste.

It works good.  Not quite as think as I am use to.

Love these, they are thick and good.

thank you..

I lie the fact that the charging is fast and I has two ports which makes it easy to use on my two phones, easy to clean and it is very portable in handling .

Good use for baking lots of different things

I never used parchment paper before but got it for baking and it did a good job. Good price. Can't go wrong with the brand.

Paper is good, but cutting edge of box doesn't cut

Good

It worked when the recipes do not include oil but with oil, it leaks through parchment paper and to the tray. Therefore, have to clean the tray. It is easy to cut and after finish using it and throw away.

It's a good quality product

This item was a great investment for me because I am able to control how much parchment paper I need due to you tearing off the paper yourself. I use to buy the ones that comes in the box but after purchasing these, I'm going to stick with this one.

This is definitely a staple in my kitchen. I use it for everything such as preparing bacon in the oven and items in the air fryer. Sturdy. Easy clean up.

Just what we needed

The size is perfect for us.  We use this in our Ninja Flex oven.  The standard size 15 inch ones are too big for it so we always have to cut an additional piece that we normally have to end up throwing out as it is too small to use for anything else.

Excellent product!

Love for baking!

What’s not to like about parchment paper

This is excellent quality parchment paper.  I initially purchased a larger size, but the larger size is always out of stock. You can use this parchment paper for all of your baking needs.

Works perfectly

Nice foil

I use this mainly when baking/broiling in my toaster oven. It's a better size than the giant parchment roll that I also have.

Absolutely love this parchment paper! I ordered it here on Amazon because I had some points to use up, and unfortunately the box arrived in a beat up condition making it difficult to use. I'll just stick to purchasing it in  our local store to ensure the box is not crushed.

I was going out of town and had finished my parchment paper before leaving. I ordered this so that it would deliver while I was gone and it worked out perfectly. Item is as advertised.

Good to have in the home . The product works great at not allowing food to stick to pan! And easy to clean up mess

Good for baking cakes and meat in the oven

Thank you

very good

Parchment paper is a must have for baking.  It separates food from the aluminum pans, so aluminum does leak into our food.  Pans stay so clean and new looking.  I also use it to wrap foods that I will put into another container for gifting or for freezing.

Been using it since i was a kid.  Wont use anything else.

A useful option

Exactly what I needed and l love the smaller size…will purchase again when I run out.  But it does last a long time.

I always keep this in the kitchen and use it a lot for baking, holding sandwiches together, and other uses.

When ordering this product when you clicked on the 60 it showed the picture of the 90 and when you clicked on the 90 it showed the picture of the 60 and I believe the price is were also switched but the product itself is okay

I grabbed up several rolls of this parchment on sale for less than half the price that my local grocery charges for their store brand!  Reynolds parchment is excellent quality; I can use the same sheet several times when making cookies; it doesn’t break down even when roasting vegetables or fish on it.  The cheaper brands work ok, but are often thinner and will tear or scorch more easily than Reynolds.  Love it when I find such a great sale!

I love this parchment paper

We use this a lot in our air fryer. It is better than foil, that cooked food products may stick to.This particular product is the perfect width for the tray in our air fryer. Most similar products are too wide and have to be cut to the required width.

This foil is always a fantastic product.

for cooking meat. I really liked it. It did not leave any dirt or oil behind. I used it clean. I definitely recommend

Works fine!

I love using parchment paper and I love how much I got for the price. I use it all the time so I’m very happy with this purchase.

Lots of uses shelf lining and baking cookies on.

Very good I do a lot of baking so was wanting a strong baking paper

Better than tinfoil and spray

I use parchment paper every time I cook so I go through a lot. This package has a very good amount of sturdy paper. Doesn't affect cooking time or temp at all and makes for easy clean up. Definitely a must have in my home!

I used these for my cookie batches. It works like any other parchment should

It does not stick to steaks in the freezer.

So happy to find a 12" roll. If you prefer that to the standard 15" I highly recommend. I was always cutting down the larger size so this is great, and as a bonus it fits in my wrap organizer now.

This brand is best for tin foil hats.  I am relieved to say that not a single alien read my mind while wearing a Reynalds hat.

It’s of a good quality and quite handy

I would say it is good

I used it on cookies sheet.  Cookies do not stick on the paper !  Also I don’t have a hard time cleaning the cookie sheet.

Just as ordered

Just what I wanted I can cut the size I want

Good paper fair price

Love this brand! Thanks

No mess or burnt pans if you are using them! The crust is much better when used for certain baking. The right size if you are using a relatively big baking tray.

You can't go wrong with Reynolds.

I purchased these for a paint and sip activity for a bachelorette party. I checked out Hobby Lobby and other craft stores and these ones were the cheapest for the greatest variety of brushes. Performed well for amateur painting and easy to clean. They seemed to be durable enough for many uses.

If you run your own art classes or have kids and don't want to spend a lot on brushes, these are them. They worked perfect for my art classes. They held up perfect for all my painting needs for my students.

I loved this buy because the same brushes at Walmart are twice the price and these are cuter. They are very soft and rinse easily. My kids can grip the long handle very well.

Are perfect for my crafting projects...good price!

For the price and the amount of brushes this is a good option.  I use for general crafting with various paints and glues.  I also use to odd areas when painting walls and cabinets to get into. You get a variety of bristle shapes to fit most needs.  I've ordered this many times.  They hold up if you remember to clean them which I am bad at sometimes.

These are nice brushes and it's a good variety of sizes and shapes. I've used them to paint with tempura paints and they apply the paint smoothly and I haven't had any bristles come loose.

I only used them a few times. The bushes were nice while they lasted. They felt good in my hand and held the paint pretty well.  Sadly, the metal tops that hold the bristles to the handle fall off way too easily. When rinsing the paint off of the brushes in plain water several of them came apart. Cheap adhesive I guess.  You get what you pay for.

I got these to do face painting and it was very important to me that the brushes were soft. The kids only complaint was that the really small ones tickled. The brushes also washed out really well with no residue.

Love these paint brushes. I can paint straight lines without being concerned about uneven bristles

I just recieved these this morning and upon opening them and feeling the bristles the bristles began to fall out without much force at all. If you want random hair bristles in your painting then these are great for you but if youre like me and dont, id stay clear of these. Bristles are falling out on almost every brush but especially the biggest one in the set as pictured. And thats before using them once to paint i cant imagine how much would come out while painting.

Not sure what world this is considered pink but it is not. More peach.

I ordered these just as cheap brushes to use in my normal crafting. One of the packs was already open and half the brushes in it were rock hard. I tried to rehabilitate the cheap brushes in some brush soap couldn't make a dent. I know these aren't high quality but I would expect to be able to use them.

These brushes are very cheaply made.  When you rinse them and try to dry them, they break.  Good thing I have 20 of them to work with.  You get what you pay for.  They are good for one time use.

Brushes don't stay in

I was excited to have some good sets of paintbrushes, but after 1 painting half of the first set broke at the end of the metal part. I wasn’t pushing down on the brushes or anything, just painting normally. I’ve never had brushes so flimsy, so that’s unfortunate.

The color was the wrong color according to website.TheBristles of the brushes come off easily. The dollar tree paint brushes are better than these. They only last one wash and one painting before they are ruined I highly suggest you not by !!!!!

These are of very low quality and are terrible for model use. Not for plastic or any models.

The advertized photo shows the handles as a cute pastel pink. The actual color received was an ugly yellow-ish pastel peach.The ones with blue handles arrived exactly as depicted in photo.

The brushes do not work well for painting in acrylic. They don't hold a line well. I would not recommend these for fine art work or detail craft work.  Otherwise they are fine.

On the first use of a couple different brushes, the bristles were falling out while I used them and by the finger fulls when I was cleaning them

After using most of the brushes in this set twice, the brush separated from the handles after cleaning. Poorly made and I'm sorry that I purchased them.

Don't waste your money. I used one to write words. Excellent job. When I rinse it, the head fell of!! These are garbage. Dissapointed

These brushes would be perfect for paint by number. Largest brush is size of my tiny pinky finger. Very small brushes.

I've used these one times and the glue for the handles came undone and bristles feel out of every brush I used

My daughter was so excited for her new brushes. She was pretty disappointed when the brush end fell off right away one one of the brushes.

Thought they would work fine for what I needed.  And they would have if they didn’t come at n me!

Anytime I tried to paint with these, bristles fell out onto my painting. Very upsetting :( was hoping for some nice paint brushes on sale for Black Friday but instead I got cheap broken brushes...

Please save your money.  These brush's were only used once. After they were cleaned and dryed. The paint cracked on the handle from the brush to the top.

Relatively cheap but I knew what I was buying so I was not surprised and I’m not complaining.

Whole painting with these brushes I noticed small hairs in my painting. Very disappointing!

Okay well firstly..they shed, more importantly they break..this is a picture of one I didn’t even use and it snapped.

Every brush I used broke the first time using it. I would never buy this product again! Money down the drain.

The top part fell apart from the stick...poor quality

Nearly all of them broke or were already breaking within the first use or a couple were already cracking at the base when they arrived. I was very dissatisfied

1st brush separated on first stroke. Do yourself a favor and invest in a better set of brushes.

My kids used these and wishing 5 minutes the heads of 5 different brushes snapped off

Brushes came in poor condition, quickly degraded into worse and worse quality. Lost bristles faster than my sanity attempting to do any detail work with this brushes. Find other cheap brushes to use.

I wanted some brushes for fine lines. Theaw brushes are awful. Do not but these. They are too still and paint doesn't flow well to the end. Just awful. Really.

They just keep breaking. Cheaply made. So so bad.

The brush kept falling apart

This is so cheap, I barely touched it and on the first use it snapped off.

These paint brushes are garbage. The little hairs come out of the tips, I’ve already had to throw half of them away.

Very cheap brushes 2 days in and it broke

I’m really upset that I bought these. I was hoping for a stiffer brush. Very flimsy and no stiffness to it.

They are really small. I am a beginner that enjoys paint nite and was looking for larger brushes. But these work fine for smaller paintings.

Awful. Wish I could get my money back. If I could rate lower I would. Completely a rip off.

Worst brushes ever! Completely falls apart during painting and cleaning.  I am so disappointed.

Misleading description making it seem like you will receive 40 instead of 20 cause it says 2 pc 20 so that was disappointing

three of the brushes were broken when it arrived

It was ok, but not for the real painter out there. Invest in beter

You get what you pay for. They look pretty, but are poorly made.  The metal brush collars come off, and break easily.  I'm having to glue them back on with hot melt glue.

These brushes are very weak. The part of the brush where the gold head connects to the wooden handle breaks very easily, especially when being cleaned. Otherwise, they work alright.

Initially, I was pleased with the look and feel of these brushes. Perhaps if I only intended to look at them, they’d be great... but I actually like to paint with my paint brushes, which is where the problems immediately became apparent. From the first time I used the first brush to apply paint, the bristles started falling out one here and one there, but within 5 minutes, they were coming out in clumps, sticking to the surface I was painting. What a disaster, trying to remove the bristles from my project which inevitably marred the paint, which had to be fixed repeatedly. This is just unacceptable at ANY level of experience. Not for kids, not for beginners, not for professionals. DO NOT RECOMMEND.

I'm plssed that the "PINK" brushes are a very light PEACH color. not at all like the add.the brushes are mid. they're exactly what you'd expect from cheap brushes. they work fine. but I feel massively lied to about the color. super disappointed, pink is my favorite color and I wanted vivid, bright pink so they'd be easy to find and tell apart from my other brushes.

Yes, the photos show the quantity of small brushes. You really only need 3-4 sizes and more large brushes and not so many little brushes. Not sure how well they will last.

Compared to other just slightly more expensive synthetic brush sets, this one is awful. If you are using these for simple crafts, they're fine, but if you actually want to paint a painting, they make it harder. The end of the large filbert brush was strangely sparse at the tip and the shape was all wrong, which rendered the brush basically useless since the pigment doesn't flow down to the edge of the brush consistently. The round brushes do not form a point well, and again have these weird wispy tips with stray long fibers. A single water brush would be more useful than this whole set.

I did not like how the brushes were marketed - I thought it was 2 packages of 20 each - instead it’s 2 packages of 10 each cheap, small paintbrushes.  Not a good value for the price.  Very short too. Better deals at craft stores.

I purchased these paint brushes, and the very first time I went to clean them, I had 2 break from the little metal part. All I did was go to dry the brush tips off with a paper towel, and the tips broke clean off. If this would have happened with a single one, I would not care, but 2 within a few minutes of each other, afther the very first use? Nope. Absolutely disappointed in the quality.

Very disappointed in these brushes as I was looking for ones that I could use for detail. The brush fibers are all uneven and fibers were pulled away from the rest, making extra marks where I didn’t want them. Got these because of the reviews and I’m annoyed I bought two packs because the reviews said they were so good. Maybe I got two bad batches but the next time I paint I’m going to have to order new paintbrushes. I will be paying more for quality.

Not good for painting acrylic on canvas, bristle length from feral is just a bit too long and the round brushes are really not tapered for getting in small areas with any accuracy.  You need brushes for your children, these will do.

First, the first package of them got delivered to the wrong address. Amazon replaced them for me and the ones they delivered arrived a day later than they said they would be. The brush handles themselves are sticky and just unpleasant to the touch. Not great for something that I'll have to be holding while painting... They are also VERY thick. I wouldn't call ANY of these brushes small enough for detailed painting (which is what I ordered them for).

As soon as my daughter removed the brushes from the package, one of them fell apart. The brush tip came off the handle.I had to use super glue to fix it.

No matter what kind of paint I used these brushes leave brush marks. Maybe good work a kid doing water coloring.

I am not a fan of these paint brushes at all. I bought them to paint on a canvas. Before I was even half way through my painting the bristles started falling out. I had to pick so many bristles off of my canvas it made it so difficult to paint a good picture. I’d definitely not buy these again.

These are not made to last more than just a couple of uses. They easily bend and snap apart, but for the price it isn't unexpected. I probably would spend a little more next time on better brushes though as these haven't even made it 3 months.

the shipping was without a doubt super fast, but the quality of the brushes didn’t last long. pieces of hair from the brush began coming out after a second use which effected some of my paintings. i wouldn’t recommend for those who paint faithfully. this is more of a beginners brush for young children.

I ordered these to do paint by numbers.... I was hoping for small detailed brushes along with the big ones and that is not what you get. Also the pink color is more of a white. I would not recommend these if you have smaller details to paint.

This is the type of set I would get for my nieces and nephews. I was not impressed by their quality of hair but it does the job. I would gift this to someone who is a beginners because the hairs are stiff to create great lines but soft to add texture.

Was given the wrong color but works nicely

Very thin handles, short. Disappointed

Several brushes lost hairs in paint( acrylic) but not when I first inspected them right out of the bags. Adequate for someone just starting out if you know they won't take the time to clean the brushes.

A little disappointed, they were not the brushes I saw first when ordering. Those were clear bristles and were angled. I will use these and they are good brushes, already had same, but was wanting the angled ones. Would have only bought the clear gloss otherwise.

I have only had it for a couple weeks and a brush head came off the wood handle. I've only used them twice. They are beautiful brushes and work well. Just not impressed with quality.  Not sure if I should return or buy another brand..

The paint brushes are good quality for the money but are too big for paint by number sets

Just terrible! They barely hold the paint and are difficult to get the paint off the brush onto the canvas. These may be good for kids projects but not for adult painters.

These are very cheaply made, half of them fell apart after two uses

By the photo, I thought these would be plentiful, but when they arrived, they are teeny tiny little brushes. And if there were 20 in the set, I'd be surprised. Never order again.

The heads break off during use and when I wash them. I’m glad I got as many as I did bc they are so flimsy. The head falls off of one every wash.

The only reason I put one star for the money is bc alot of the tops came apart so I had to super glue them back on

The brushes are way too soft for any fine details or lines -- I'm doing miniature work in acrylics and this purchase was waste of time.

Ok if you dont paint mich but not worth the money

Most of the brushes are fine but one of my brushes brisols all fell out before I could use it  wouldnt recommend buying.

Got double the brushes for the price of 1. The brushes are very light weight and are inexpensive. Used them with face paint and they seem very cheaply made but can make them work for now.

The bristles started falling out on these my first time using them.  The price was great but the brushes are not so great.

Not the best brushes, my set had hairs sticking out on one of the brush and another is crooked. But it gets the job done for beginner acrylic painting.

The first brush I tried to use the tip came off. I ended up taping it back on to still use it

You get what you pay for. These keep falling apart. The brush detaches from the stick part way too much.

Bristles are uneven and had what looked like old painter ink on one.

I find the brushes of poor-medium quality.  I paint every weekend and clean my brushes meticulously and I already have hairs coming out of my brushes.

The hairs were coming out the very first time I used several of the brushes. Not for serious artists.

The overall quality of the brushes is not that great. I used once and the bristles are starting to fall out after once use. I would have been better off going to Michaels.

Be careful while cleaning them. Either the bristles, or the entire brass piece holding the bristles will come off in your hand. 😭

Horrible detail brushes..not trimmed, random bristle lengths.  Not recommended for fine artwork.

Not ideal. Won't be buying again. Spend money on some actual paintbrushes. The hairs spread out within the first day I used them.

The hairs came out easy on my projects.

You press them when painting a and they brock

There are better value brush sets than this one.

The brushes are not made well. Stray fibers, fuzzy tips. Ok for little kids not for serious painting.

Good enough for grandchildren.

The brushes seem fine but they are definitely not what I purchased in the picture advertised. I’m sure they work fine, they just don’t present the way I pictured at all; I’m using these for an event, so I wanted them to look a particular way. They aren’t shimmery, they’re a flat color and more peachy looking. They also have numbers printed on them, some of which are smudged slightly.

Its ok

Lots of brushes… very generous…quality fair…no spring back on bristles.They flair out and do not return to shape… no spring in their brush.

These are great for work brushes when you don’t want to use the “good paintbrush” to apply something. Probably fine for other mediums but I’m working with watercolor

needed round tip.  most were flat

Breaks eay

These paint brushes aren’t the best in the world. They feel more like cheap number 2 pencils than paint brushes, but you get what you paid for. If you’re a beginner painter or a hobbyist then these will suffice.

Didn’t like the brushes

Brushes looked to be well-made and a great value. However, after being used a few times , bristles became misshapen and did not regain the original shape. I would not recommend for oils and solvent used in thinning and cleaning.

They work but don’t last long at all a few uses and toss them differ serious projects

I haven’t used them yet so unable to give an accurate rating

I usually buy good brushes. These I sent to my sister who is just starting out painting after a stroke. They are adequate for the present time.

For the price, these brushes do the job I need them to do. But they don't clean up well and lose their point if I look at them wrong. I think it was a good idea to get these as a beginner, but I quickly learned that I prefer spending even just a little more for one nicer brush than having a bunch of these cheap ones now loitering in my space.

These brushes are somewhat good for the price. If your looking for something cheap to use, and not particular then get these. i Recommend for beginners

the brush itself is very nice and what I was looking for. but the quality of the build is what you pay for. the handles fell off almost all the brushes immediately after opening the package. Like I said, brush quality is very nice. Honestly haven't had the chance to use them yet, so I really don't know how they hold up to the paint or thinners yet.  glue the handle back on and have a nice cheap set of brushes.

I do paint by number art and I’m always looking for a good set of brushes. These are ok but I noticed that the bristles don’t stay on to the colors very well and tend to streak and smear.

I bought these for painting miniatures. Not the best brushes, and somewhat soft (they don't have a lot of spring to them) but they suit my purposes. Probably wouldn't buy again, but they are holding up after months of use, so that is a plus!

Not sure an artist would use these.  Quality so-so

Brushes are soft witch is nice to paint with but they seem to fall apart very easily and that's the down fall mine didn't last long at all before the tops started falling off kind of bums me out

Vibrant orange bristles with peach handles.

I failed to look at this before I purchased.  But these are strictly for detail painting.  They are very small.  I will make use of them, but you need to be sure about what size you want and make sure you convert from cm to inches.  I'm glad they weren't terribly expensive.  As they are basically taklon, I'm sure I can use them as I do a lot of detail, but I really wanted a full set of larger brushes.

For little kids yes very nice.For beginning painters not recommended.They do not hold form well.

I bought these brushes because I needed some obviously and they’re okay I guess but the only thing is that the pink brushes are discolored and look more peachy instead of pink.

I purchased these for a Brain Break Activity for my Summer Music Clinic.Most of them survived, but a few of them ended up like this. My students were not in anyway rough with the brushes so not sure what caused the break. But broke on first try. I'll get new ones and different ones.

i guess it works… i will try

Was a little disappointed the handles loosen quickly and easily.  Some just falling apart.

The brushes are very stiff. I don’t see how you would be able to use them for watercolor or any fine art work. I bought them for general use in my metalsmith studio for applying liquid fluxes, patinas and firecoats. They may be a little stiff for some work but I am hoping they soften up with use. Might work well for heavy handed children’s use.

Just received these today. I ordered pink for my daughter but these are NOT PINK. They are a light peach. Don't know about the quality of the brushes yet, but disappointed with the color.

Ok. Not very sturdy for my use.

I would have liked a little bit more variety in terms of brush sizes. Cleaning them was a bit difficult as the paint sometimes would stay stuck in the bristles even after putting them in water for awhile. Great for beginners, jowever, it would sometimes get blotches on the canvas. It definitely needs atleast 1 big brush in the set since the biggest is pretty small.

They don't seem to last very long.  You get what you paid for.

They were nice and easy to work with, but when cleaning some broke. The brush came off the stick. Easy fix but still annoying

The item needs better glue to keep the thing together. During the first use the brush separated from the stick.

These brushes have worked well for me other than the colored coating flakes off of the handles and is distracting while painting. You have to watch the chips don’t fall off into what you’re painting. This happened my third time using them and every time since. They should have left the handles bare wood.

They are okay. They came in more of a peach color then a pink color. But what can I do. Wouldn't buy again.

There are 2 sets, now I know why, there aren't many in either set z c but I fit the 2 set desk because I'm buying for 2 different types of painters. One paints with water, the other paints with oil paint.

You really get what you pay for with these. They started to fray pretty quickly, and I’ve only been able to really keep a single one shaped. Not the easiest to clean paint out of either. I’d recommend spending a little bit more to get brushes that last.

Decent brushes if you aren’t looking for something very permanent. The paint on the stick of the brushes started peeling off and the head of the brush fell off a few times as well. Other than that the brushes painted really nice and smoothly for the decent quality.

These are pretty good for beginners but after a while they start to peel and sometimes u can put up with it but sometimes the chips fall on your painting and that's annoying. They last pretty long tho. I think I purchased these about 6 months ago, maybe more, and they're pretty much still standing

It is a good deal as long as you don't expect excellent quality. They serve the purpose but we lost a few on the first use when the brush heads just came off. Easy to glue back in but qualityneeds work

You get what you pay for. They're not excellent, they are stiff and not easy to use. I use them for pastry decoration so they were useful for me, but as brushes, they are worth the cheap price you have paid.

For a long time I had one of these paint brushes but I never could find the right one a Amazon really help me The bristles are nice it doesn’t really show up on the camvas

Brushes are ok for beginners but for delicate painting they seem to have too many stray hairs on them, I have to keep tweezers nearby to pluck the wild strands off .

The brushes are so flimsy that you can barely get one use out of them before they break and fall apart.

Brush heads flew off on first time use. Bristles left lots of streaks too.  Otherwise fine.

When they came in everything looked fine and once I opened the bag the bigger brushes we’re fine but the small thin ones and bristles that were all over the place and very hard to paint with

The paint brushes are stiff

it is what it is

they work well but they are slightly uneven in terms of some of the bristles are probably glued on weird, but they still work well for me because i do background paintings anyway so they don’t need to be perfect

These are not the best brushes, but let's be honest. Good brushes cost good money. We teach an art class to seniors with Alzheimer's and these are perfect for that purpose. They are solid brushes and last several months before needing to be replaced.  Sometimes the necks pop off after a few months so just know that's the quality of these. I'm so glad for them for our purposes, which is why I'm doing 4 stars here. I recommend for non-professional art classes.

Great size assortment, good quality, great price.

When the package arrived the bag was intact, but all of the paints were in the bottom of the bag and the box was destroyed inside. The products purchased were fine. But now I can’t put the paint in the box

Nice paint brushes for doing ceramic work. There's a great selection of sizes.

These look nice, good price, quality looks decent. My only issue is that they were supposed to be delivered the day after I ordered them, but the shipping kept getting delayed which delayed which hindered my project timing.

Got these to use in my craft room. The variety of sizes is perfect for my needs.

These are great little craft brushes. The fibers don't come out and stick in your project and they also don't leave brush marks as long as you take care of them. I got a double set at Amazon for less than I would have paid elsewhere. Well worth it.

Really nice and soft brushes

Works

I have been using these off and on for painting miniatures.  They work well, so no complaints there.  I will mention that I got 2 of the size  brushes instead of a size 6.  Not really a significant issue for me, but prevents me from rating 5 stars

Good a few paint & Sips!

Not the greatest quality but they’re what you expect for the price! Good for kid painting and light projects but I wouldn’t plan to do much more with them. The brush themselves aren’t very thick

I got these to paint tote bags, and they worked pretty well. The only thing is that the metal clasps aren’t super sturdy. I snapped one while cleaning it. Other than that one, they all held up. And there’s a variety of sizes, which is helpful for painting large and small details. So overall, a good set.

I bought these for my middle school classroom and overall, I'm happy with them. The construction is pretty poor; the crimping is much too loose, so you'll need to spend a while finding all the loose ones and super gluing the brushes onto the handles before kids can use them (otherwise about a third of them will just come apart). That being said, after gluing, these have worked really well for my students - the variety is great, the bristles don't fall out all over the place; for the price, I think these are a good value. I would probably buy them again for my painting class, but next time I might have kids do the gluing lol

Great value, not an expensive brush selection but for the price is great value.  A more experienced artist requiring exception results would not be happy with these less expensive brushes.

This is a great starter and budget set. They worked well. I had slightly mixed results. The fine tip 2 kept its shape well and helped me zone in my paints in tight areas. Two of the slightly wider brushes had issues with maintaining shape. The one took on the paint color. The tip is now green. Two of the brushes stopped being pliant while painting. Although the paint I used was drying quickly. Which may also be why they were difficult to clean. So, start with these and upgrade as you can.

Grandparents' Day at our center. The children were able to hold the brushes with great ease.

My girlfriend wanted to try painting for her birthday these did the trick as we're just painting for fun. Good option if you're on a budget or for your kids

This is a good set of brushes for beginners or kids.

Good

These brushes are great for youngsters they are stiff and hold their form well but do not hold a lot of paint so possibly not as messy.

They are  nice brushes for beginners and  easy to clean.

My expectations were lower that I expected. They actually work well for face painting.

The little hairs may stray or fall off into your painting (which is annoying), but I keep buying them. You get a lot for a cheap price and it’s worth it. Plus if they get ruined, I don’t feel bad throwing them away. Does it’s job.

Brushes are durable, easy to use and easy to clean.  I work on many different projects and these work just right for each one.

This seems like a nice little beginner's set, I bought these strictly for the purpose of basically junk brushes to kind of mess around with whenever I was doing watercolor painting. But if you want something that's pretty cheap and you're just starting out and don't want some super expensive high-end brush and these will work just fine as beginner brushes or just hobby brushes they pretty much serve their purpose, although one of them that's in the second picture was particularly uneven but I might have just gotten a bad one, stop being said out of all of the brushes there was only one that really was kind of uneven so that's fine to me.

These brushes would be perfect for beginners or for someone that is not doing artwork for a living. They clean up OK but they do have a tendency to lose the bristles. I probably would buy again because it is a good price if I beat one up I don’t feel bad about throwing it away.

Not terrible, they work and have good sizes, just won't last forever

Hello all, I paint miniatures for about 2-4 hours a day and I am constantly going through brushes. The ONLY good thing that these brushes are good for is the rough stuff. I legit had all of my round brushes come with their tips curled and I bought two sets. If you're trying to do detailed work I would not recommend using these, but if you're looking for a cheap stick with hair on it to lay down some quick thin coats and then when the brush is used up, using it to add the nasty stuff to your bases; You're all set.I gave them 4 stars because the tips were either curled or frayed before opening. Otherwise I would've given them 5 stars for the price and my intent with them.

Nice choices

I was surprised to see how small length and round they actually are. They're about the size of the picture themselves!

I grabbed a set to paint in tight nooks and crannies on an outdoor display and they worked perfectly. This is another product that its simply not worth the time to try and clean and reuse them again as for as cheap as they are throw it away and start with a clean fresh brush for the next color. Paints well and would recommend.

I thought this was a very good product for a 2 hour make-and-take class that I conducted.  It provided many size options to meet the needs of the students and the bristles cleaned out quickly and easily so as to move right along to the next color, etc.  However, I must say that after only about 4 or 5 rinses, the water apparently saturated the handle enough to make the blue start to flake off and that became very irritating to a lot of students as it sometimes got into their project area.  I would recommend being very careful in the washing clean process so as not to get too much water on the handles.

This product is fine for any kind of beginners

The brushes work fine with acrylic, watercolor, and powder pigments. The only complaint is that the brush metal sleeve will detach from the handle if you tug on it while washing them. Nothing a drop of superglue can’t fix, but they could have tried a little harder there 😂

Easy to hold.

Good for the price! They break easily but they're really nice for an amateur like myself.

These are great!  Just don't count on much for durability

I've painted with them two days in a row, fairly good however the some bristles are starting to stray and I'm petty sure they hold in moisture (grey water went all over one of my paintings after cleaning them and a little green paint has come out too) plus they almost instantly transition into a brownish orange color. But I am a pretty new to painting so this could be my fault.

I bought these for dry brushing since they were cheap but I ended up using these for other things as well. They are pretty good brushes for the price and pretty good for a beginner who doesn't know if they'll enjoy painting or not.

I got these because they were cheap but not *too* cheap. I needed some new brushes for an indoor mural I'm working on and these do the job. They're cheap enough that I don't really care if some of them are bad, or if they get ruined quickly.  I would recommend them for beginners, art teachers, and anyone who wants a decent brush that isnt $10 a piece and doesn't need to be *perfect*

Nice set of budget brushes, and a good value for the double set you get. These aren't super high quality, but the set includes a great variety of brushes that fit most needs for small paint needs. I use them for modelling and 3d prints that need a little extra flair, and they are awesome for that. The brushes seem well crimped, with very few hairs separating while using them, which is usually a problem with the cheaper sets. Would certainly buy these again.

I bought these for an outdoor stencil.  Didnt cost much so I threw it away when done. There are a lot of shapes to choose from which was nice,.

nice brushes

Great product for beginners. I would recommend.

Will be used for my spring/ summer project and love all the different sizes.

with this package i will have brushes for years

Can’t wait to use them

This is good quality for the low price 👍

Would recommend to any painter. Fast delivery.

These brushes are so good they nylon hair tips are of great quality and they are just a pleasure to create art with.

Use it for DYII projects

Very good

I love these paint brushes! They have sturdy wooden handles, they’re easy to clean, and come with a variety of different sizes (10 total). Love the reusable plastic case as well. I would highly recommend!

A good set for painters of all levels. Much better than the brushes that come with paint-by-numbers sets, which is what I am using them for. A great value.

Very nice product... I use them to assemble model projects with my grand-kids and we enjoy using good quality brushes...

Everything I’ve purchased has been top quality, always exceeds my expectations and delivery is always prompt and on time.

My old paint brushes were worn out so I bought these and I could not be any happier they are the perfect high quality brushes.

I made a painting for my birthday and it turned out better than expected!

Good brushes so far. Can't beat the price.

great value

Well made

like

These are great fro the price, if you keep them washes they should last fairly long! Not streaky when painting  too

They seem great no Bristles have come Out they were packaged well And they even have a little pencil case with them basically so that is helpful for storing them afterwards, along with my other paint brushes and other Tools I use for painting Pretty good variety of brushes would've preferred may be a few more smaller, fine tipped kind Brushes that were a little more square shaped But overall, pretty happy and would recommend for the price

Good selection, very nice brushes

Fun and work great

I ordered it for my daughter. The quality is super. I am 100% satisfied with the product.

I wanted to fix a few scratches on my car but realized I didn't have any small brushes so I ordered this set as it had varying sizes that I thought would be perfect. The set was inexpensive and the brushes were good quality. I used the smallest ones for the touch up and they worked perfectly. The brushes cleaned up nicely and I'm planning to use them for a few tight areas on my walls where I can't get a normal brush in. Overall very happy with this set as the bristles are just about perfect, stiff enough to put the paint where you want it and soft enough where they don't leave lines. Highly recommended.

Used these at a camp for extra face painting brushes and they were great for that!

These brush sets are well designed unlike many others that are flimsy and their bristles fray after only a use or two. These bristles have maintained their shape after many uses. Great value!

Great value and lots of variety. Very soft. Used for a kids face painting class. Also comes with a resealable container for transport.

No hairs have even up on my paintings yet! Coverage is a little lacking, but over great product, definitely buy again!

I bought these thinking it was 2 sets of 20, but it is actually 2 sets of 10- totaling 20 paintbrushes. They are good quality for the price point though. I used these for a kids paint party and they worked well for their purpose. No shedding, good coverage, and held up well even after multiple paint and washes.

You can usually tell as soon as you handle a product if it will be great or junk. From the quality packing to the construction of the brushes, this brush pack is worth a lot more than I paid. The brushes paint smoothly, are easily cleaned, and can be used repeatedly without degrading. There are multiple sizes of brushes to choose from. I will buy it again.

I wanted these for craft acrylic paint and they work perfectly! And I love all the color choices! Excellent brushes, I would recommend to a friend!

These are just like another few blue sets around here, but when I bought them, this was the most economical way to buy tons of cheap touch up brushes.

Love the price and all the different brush styles you get with these! The bristles don’t fall out despite little crafter use. They worked great with acrylics and glitter!

The brush heads are nice and clean.  No loose hairs to mess up your painting.  The brushes clean easily and are easy to hold.  I recommend these for beginner painters and kids will love them too.  The handles are good quality and I was able to use the heads of the handles to make perfect dots.Thus is a great set of brushes.

Some of the best lower-priced art brushes I've found!

Bought them to model paint.  No issues with the quality.  Variety of brush tips to allow for various detail work.  Can't beat the price point for the set.

Good buy! Would buy again, arrived on time and as described.

The BOSOBO Paint Brushes Set is a gem! With 20 pieces in 2 packs, these round pointed tip brushes are versatile and perfect for various art projects. Whether you're using acrylics, oils, or watercolors, these nylon hair brushes deliver precise and smooth strokes. They're great for face and nail art, miniature detailing, and rock painting. Plus, the blue color adds a fun touch to your art supplies collection!

Purchased these for a friend's sip and paint party.  Great quality and easy to clean.

I use these brushes with angelus paint to customize shoes and these brushes are perfect for it. They are great. No shedding and hold up well. I will continue to use the brushes.

ordered a case of these Kleenex hand towels when I opened the sealed Kleenex box there were only 5 boxes in the case. the case was sealed so this is how Kleenex shipped to amazon.  when I went to tell amazon that there was only 5 instead of 6 in box I had to call the manufacturer.  first I contacted on line on response then I called they tried to defer me back to amazon but its not amazon it the manufacturer packing process that shorted me.  I wanted to send back the whole case for a new one and the only thing they offered was a $3.00 coupon which by the way does me no good can't find them in the stores which is why I order from amazon.  so I'll just suck it up because Kleenex can't back THERE issue...not a big deal but big irritation that there issue becomes my loss........

I dont know what's going on with these. I use to absolutely love these. They felt so soft almost cloth like. I use a case a month. And now I seldom get them because most of them now feel like they are made with fiberglass. Please bring back the soft tissue!!

I've been using these since before COVID. They're so soft and absorbent and great for when you have multiple guests going in and out of your bathroom. The one star is because the "new boxes" are gosh-awful ugly and only 1 box might go well near wine bottles. I bought a set because they're cheaper but couldn't wait for them to run out so I could go back to the old style boxes because the new ones don't match with any decor! Sorry Kleenex but your "design team" needs to rethink these new looks!!

I would have liked to give zero stars if possible in rating the product I received!I have purchased Kleenex hand towels for years and through Amazon and they have been well worth the $$, soft, pliable and wonderful! The Kleenex towels I received were not the ones pictured in the upright containers as I always received, which are so soft and amazing. The ones I received, and unfortunately opened already because I figured they had just changed the box shape, feel like the towels at the gas station you use to clean your windshields with, nonpliable, harsh, easily ripped, and definitely not something you would want to dry your hands off with. They are not worth any amount of money, much less the $40 plus I paid for them. Shame on this vendor for misrepresenting this great Kleenex brand with the mess I was sent! Amazon, do something about this misrepresentation!

UPDATEDREVIEW: Went to purchase for a 4th time and the price has more than doubled. $16.99 -$18.99 and now $44 fir the same amount. /// Original Review: I really like having these in the house for guests.. They are pretty asorbant and you only need to use one. The box makes it easy to display on a towel rack or next to the sink. They have especially been nice to have during the pandemic - helps keep things extra clean! I also purchase a second set and sent it to my parents. The colors in this set of 6 are a tad funky. I would prefer a solid color or something that isn't as gaudy. Twice I have had boxes not open easily and the plastic opening tears. (See my picture.) Still a wonderful product and will purchase again.

The new prints on the boxes are ugly, they do not look good with my decor.  I am very disappointed that you shipped me these prints.  The picture shows just one of the assorted prints that I WAS getting and I am wondering if you will be able to ship those prints.  If not then I will have to end my subscription

This shipment contained 1 completely used box of towels and another partially used box.

This product looks great in theory. I bought the 6-box pack in hopes it would be a nice addition to our household. But upon attempting to pull out a single sheet, 14 sheets came out with it! It's extremely challenging to pull out a single sheet. So now I have a stack of 13 sheets in a pile next to the Kleenex box dispenser.

These paper towels are extremely convenient, but the last couple years they have had regular manufacturing defects:  The plastic film isn't fully perforated (as was the case with my last order) making them hard open.  Many time the sheets are rotated in the box in such a way that they don't come out easily or come out in huge bunches of 3-5 sheets.  Company should make more effort at quality control.

I have had an auto refill for years, I don’t know what or who created current designs on boxes but terrible. I will cancel subscription, boxes match nothing :(

The cardboard carton from Kleenex contained six disposable hand towel boxes.  One of the disposable hand towel boxes was completely empty.  So I paid for six and only got five.Probably not a problem with the vendor, they could not have known.Problem was with quality control on the product.  Kleenex packed and shipped an empty hand towel box.

i love the product but who ever packed it needs a lesson  it was virtually impossible to open without damaging he product

One of the six boxes we received was sealed but empty.  Someone else's review mentioned the same thing.  So this isn't isolated, check your boxes.

Very bad, this is the fourth (4) time of no delivery from Livermore, and you keep sending my order request to them knowing that they do not deliver to Hayward Ca, 94541, maybe you do not care about my business. Why ?

These are much bolder pattern multi bright colored boxes that aren't even compareable to the original ones to blend/not clash with my decor. Actually these patterns are not complimentary to any decor.

DO NOT LIKE THE NEW EXPRESSION DESIGN,,,,MY BOXES OF KLEENEX WERE SQUASHED,,,,I AM CANCELLING MY ORDER!  FJ

I thought i was getting boxes that look like the fog or fruit instead i received hideous boxes that are too ugly to display- what a bait and switch

The box they were in looked like it had been through World War III.  The side of the boxes were crashed in,  Extremely disappointed !

Waited soooo long for this order, which was supposed to be the boxes that sit on the towel bar. When they arrived it was all boxes that sits on the sink (which we don't have room for). It would've been nice to get a notification of the substitution, which I would've cancelled.

I don't like the new designor color go back to the way it was

New boxes are bright and child like in design.  Does not go with most decor

I regularly order this product...a box of 6.  One of the 6 boxes arrived sealed but completely empty.  We paid for 6 boxes and received 5 + 1 empty box.

Upon receiving the package, we realized that on of the boxes was empty. We did not receive the full amount of paper towels as was stated in the order details. Other than that, the product is great! It meets our needs and would like to keep ordering this product, but not sure if we will if Amazon isn't checking this particular product before it gets sent out.

All boxes were wet in the shipping box

The box was totally damaged and the contents inside were damaged as well rendering them unusable.

I like the items I purchased only problem I have is one of my items was missing

The package arrived  unopened, but inside there was 5 boxes full of tissues and one that was empty . No tissues in one box.

DONT ORDER!!! only 4 in box that is fully sealed, all tissue boxes damaged!!

One of the boxes of 60 Hand Paper towels was sealed, but was totally empty. No Hand paper towels were enclosed in the decorative box. I should receive credit for this box of 60 Paper hand towels or a new box of 60 Paper hand towels should be sent to me.

Very damaged and weird thing is that the outside shipping box was perfectly fine!  No dents no nothing, just the individual boxes were trashed.Does Amazon treat all packaging like this?  Not very satisfied at all, very disappointed.

I have also received a shipment with one, not sixty, only one towel in the box. It would be funny if I didn’t pay for it. Since I’m not the only one this has happened to, obviously there’s a production/quality assurance check issue. I want another box sent! Buyer beware!

I ordered the six pack case of this product and as I was unpacking the box, I noticed one was extremely light.  Upon examining it, it looks normal from the outside but you can see by looking in it, there are no towels in the box.

The 1st  box I purchased was great.They were thick and large, very absorbent!!Then I couldn’t find them anywhere.I ordered them when Amazon had them again.These are the worst!! Thin, small and I will never buy them again!!

I ordered this in January, 6 boxes usually last me a few months. I got to my last box, and found it was sealed empty! I'm very upset to have paid for an empty box. Too late for my return window!

I just opened the box I had delivered last January. It was supposed to contain 6 boxes of hand towels, but there were only 5 boxes inside.

Hate the juvenile pattern

the dispenser is more like a giant tissue box. I wanted the one on the picture because I can use it on my towel rack in place of the traditional hand towel

Just start opened box and thought new packing wrong. The Kleenex hand towels are wonderful But what I received was more like sandpaper.  Try ordering again.  My husband can use these in the shed.

I love these towels, but my last shipment of 6 were not really fit for public spaces.  The boxes are all misaligned.

Box arrived, beaten up’ per amazon delivery notice Pic. Then of course before we got home the sprinklers came on in the neighborhood. Two out of the box where somewhat usable. Misshaped... but usable. Love the product. Delivery bad.

I bought these for the bathroom more for sanitary reasons.  I found myself wrestling with the box trying to get a hand towel out to dry my hands.  The box is very large and takes up quite a bit of counter space.  Most people mistook it for a tissue box as opposed to a hand towel, so it really served no purpose.  People didn't use them because they thought they were drying their hands with tissue.  The concept is good, but they are not very practical.

I think papertowels/napkins/toilet tissue should not have an odor, AT ALL! I purchased these to use to pat my face dry after washing before bed. Thinking of bacteria on a towel & thought these would be better to be able to use & toss. The odor is not that fuel smell you get when something has come over on a ship & was stored way down under. It's more of a bad onion odor. I will finish them up in guest bathroom for drying hands but will not use on my face nor will I purchase again.

I love the hand towels but they changed the design of the boxes. They used to be classic and go with any decor and now they are bright bold colors in bright purple, bright pink, bright orange and bright green which doesn’t go with anything in my home. I sent them back. I thought the patterns were ugly as well. Bring back the original designs and colors PLEASE!!

If you're using it upright rather than on your towel rack, there is no weight to it. So you have to use two hands - one to hold the box, the other to pull the hand towel.

The Kleenex hand towels are thick enough to dry hands. What I dislike most and will not buy again is that they stick together. I have to use a wet hand to separate them. Guest will have to manually have to pull apart due to the way they overlap one another. If this was fixed, I would definitely buy again.

Sometimes have to use two towels when I only had to use one in the past. The new towels are less dense, thinner, and transparent compared to the old. It’s clear they went cheap and don’t care about their customers. Will no longer be purchasing due to high price point. Can’t justify using twice as many and still paying the same price unless they revert back to the original thickness. Disappointing.

I purchased these towels to dry my face after washing off my makeup because disposable towels promoted for that are more expensive but these smell absolutely horrible once wet and are not that absorbent. I expected better from Kimberly Clark

These hand towels are great to have in the house for the guest powder room, especially now that people are able to start visiting again after the pandemic.  Just place on the towel rack and no worries about everyone reusing hand towels or where to put little paper guest towels in a small guest bathroom.  Very convenient and hygienic.  Already placed one box in the guest 1/2 bath.  The only issue is that the boxes were crushed, not the shipping case, just crushed when the shipper was opened.  I'm keeping even though the boxes look battered because I need them and will just tell guests that unfortunately during a pandemic we can't expect things to be perfect.  Would definitely buy again but hope that when I open the shipper in the future the boxes are in better shape.  Giving 2 stars not because of the quality of the paper towels, but only because of the crushed boxes inside the shipping case.

I had high hopes for this product especially because of the efficient-looking dispenser. The quality of the towel is decent enough but it’s not a good product.First, the dispenser looks way too much like a Kleenex box which is confusing to guests using the powder room.Next, the other reason it resembles a Kleenex box (besides the word Kleenex on the side) is that the towels are barely larger than an unfolded tissue. This makes a “one and done” approach difficult especially if you have inefficient hand washers…like kids…using the powder room.Finally, the thickness isn’t there either. For the money, they are aesthetically convenient but don’t work well.

Disliked the colors of the boxes….

This is the second time that I Purchased this set of boxed paper towels. But This time I received a completely empty box and then one of the other boxes was only half full of paper towels. I know this could have just been a mechanical error somewhere on an automated assembly line somewhere but I feel the weight of the boxes could have atleast been checked so that I wouldn’t be charged real money for a box and a half of air :/

I have been buying this product at Walmart for a few years now - perfect for guests, sanitary and  attractive on the counter top. However, due to COVID, I ordered it from Amazon. The order was a six pack. All six of the boxes are coming apart & need to be glued at the top & sides. One of the six was smashed on the side & bottom, i.e., will not stand up on the counter top. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE CONDITION OF MY ORDER AT ALL.  There was no protective filler between the shipping box and the hand towel boxes. The towels, however, I am assuming to be as sturdy & absorbent as in the past so giving it two stars.

The item description says that you get 6 boxes of hand towels but I only received 4 boxes

Never ever had this happen…..I’ve ordered this product in the past and have always been satisfied….I got this box of six inner boxes and there was only five inner boxes in it. I’ll send back and won’t purchase again. I’m very disappointed because these little boxes are the perfect size for my camper and small guest bath.

Was excited to know I could order them, very difficult to find. So, ordered a case. Product arrived quickly. Product themselves looked and opened as if they had been stored fir a long time in a damp location. Opening strips stuck to box top. Boxes didn't seal propery, just over all "old" boxes. Look and on counter.Still love the product just not the packaging when ordered.

This paper product is an expensive alternative to paper towels.  It's value is it's a better presentation than paper towels.  The paper isn't absorbency and weak.  I wouldn't recommend this product...recommend going with paper towels.

I use this product in the bathroom one is pale green the other blue, the boxes I was sent are modern stripes with gold and pink and brown and gold yuck, what happen to the solid colors blue , sand etc. I am  not happy with color of boxes and have  had to take towels out of box and set on the side of wash basins. I don't plan on purchasing again as the boxes are ugly and don't go with the calm colors in my bathrooms.

Have a feeling that these boxes are ones that don’t pass  the Kleenex quality inspection. The boxes  are poorly made and I’m pretty sure will tear apart when you pull one of the paper towels out of the box.  What a waste of money

Horrible colors for a normal bathroom. I didn't know that this was what I was getting.

So disappointed in this product/purchase. This I thought was supposed to be wet wipes. Not wet wipes so they don't serve my purchase. Then my caregiver says they are rough. That they do not glide on the skin. She has the smoothest skin and it snagged. She has a lot of experience with these products from many years experience.

Smashed dented boxes

I purchased because I love this product but I'm extremely upset because I was charged 3 times for 1 order and Amazon can only see I was charged once. I'm currently disputing it with my bank but this was a pain in the neck to deal with.

The product is good. Unfortunately the box of 6 included one empty box. It had no napkins in them just the box. That was odd

We order these tissues on a regular basis, but this time when the case of six boxes of tissues arrived, There was one the was completely empty!  It was sealed just like the others, but totally empty!  I have not opened it, in hopes that I can trade it in on a full one!!!

When they showed up three out of five boxes were soaked and destroyed, very weird because the outside of the box was not wet. I will not ship these back but would like them replaced

It was a box for 6 boxes but there was only 5 boxes in it. What is up.

More absorbent than most paper towels.Box designs are cute. Expensive so only used in guest bath

Another empty box.  Box 3 of 6 was totally emptyThey need better QC!!We prefer paper towels over cloth as you haven’t a clue as to how long the cloth towels  have been there! Cloth towels are always damp and just breed germs

They would work greater if they charged you for 5 boxes instead of 6 boxes. Because I only got 5 of 6 boxes of these wonderful towels. Since I can't get a 1/6th refund from chatbot the price per box went up. Get me?

Nice idea but the towels are really too small. It takes two to get your hands dry. Won't order again. A roll of paper towels works better.

I did not like the product; the towels were too soft for a paper towel, also the content was less than i expected. I will go back to my usual order of PACIFIC BLUE, even though i was trying to save money, this was not a bargain for me.

the towels themselves are great, but I was shorted one box...only had five boxes in the package.

I felt these Kleenex towels were not as soft and absorbent as I would have liked. They should be larger

Softer than the previous hand towels but feels much more like facial tissue. The size is smaller too.

I love these towels everyone who visits me loves them

Excellent absorbance and softness but would use more if larger.

Very unhappy.  The case had 6 boxes but one box was sealed but empty.  There doesn’t seem to be any way to contact customer service.

Even though six boxes of these hand towels are supposed to be in one package, upon opening, the box only contained five boxes .  I am disappointed in not receiving what was advertised.

Boxes were all warped.

love the product but they came all beat up. Not all of them but enough. Pain in the neck too send them back. Have to make do.

Boxes where damaged

Only received 5 boxes instead of 6

The ugly new colors don’t match anything in my bathroom. I liked the plain geometric colors better because they looked OK upside down and they had a removable label. The color and the advertisement is upside down when I put these on my towel rack.

Box and contains were both damaged

My order stated there were 6 boxes.  I received 5 boxes. Missing part of the order!!!!

One box of the six was empty. Factory sealed, no tissues???

These look cheap when mounted in the bathroom. Consider a hand towel holder or something different.

Please send 1 box please.

Shipping box and individual boxes damaged. Not pleased with order.

Case came damaged you could only see after opening

Really like the convenience of having these in the bathroom, especially to get away from dirty/damp hand towels. But they’re really not very absorbent at all - it’s almost like they just smear the water around your hands when you use them. They’re ok, but we’re not exactly thrilled.

The shipping box was damaged before being shipped and was repaired but one box inside was damaged and torn tissues not cool

I have been  buying these for years, but now they are rougher; not as soft to the touch. I am disappointed with the latest batch. First, toilet paper rolls got smaller. Now this is not as soft.

Nice soft white paper towels in a decorative box. I keep one under the sink in my bathroom and another out in the guest bathroom. It’s a much more sanitary method for guests.I was a bit disappointed this time. The outer, Amazon box was undamaged. The inner product box was crushed on one edge. 2 of the decorative boxes were too damaged to use for guests. This was obviously damaged before shipment as the outer box was undamaged. I will keep them in my bathroom cabinet and will use them so decided not to return. Just disappointed.

Their box is a loser.  It has a lean-to design, that is terrible.  The towels will not come out without a fight.  Almost impossible with one hand, therefore useless for a handicapped person.  I even looked for a dispenser for them but did not find one.  I will not buy them again because of this.

Seems to move the water around my hands without drying. OK for guests I think.

Not quite what I expected,  but it's okay.

These are thick.  They don't come out of the dispenser very well.  They are "ok."  Would not buy again.

Up until my last order of this product, I had no complaints. Now I notice that the towels are smaller than before (previously 9.1 x 9.1 inches, now 9.1 x 8.0 inches). Also, the material feels rougher on my skin. I’ll be thinking twice before buying these again, especially as we’re getting less product for the same amount of money.

I do love these hand towels in the bathroom.  However, the boxes they show on Amazon are vibrant and colorful and I wish that is what you would receive.  Instead you receive the old boxes with horible colors of gold, silver and gray.  Very Very outdated and so disappointing.  Wish they would sell you what they show!!

PLEASE bring back the old designs.  The new designs look like a bunch of girl scout cookie boxes. What were you thinking.  Neutral colors please or at least give us back the option to buy the old designs.

Have used these for years, love them, unfortunately Kleenex just changed the color of their boxes to more psychedelic colors.  Not a fan.  Please go back to your previous non descript colored boxes.  Thank you.

I got the ugliest boxes ever. Not the pretty, cool ones in the description. Must be old stock nobody wanted. I had to just take some out of the boxes to put in mt guest bath.

We had a gathering at our house with lots of guests. I liked the idea of having individual pull-down towels in a dispenser. Little did I know that they don’t absorb water. In our utility bathroom we used a roll of paper towels on a coat hanger and they were so much better!  Not as pretty but more functional. I think these are made of recycled plastic.

These hand towels are nice, but seem to be a little thinner now than when I first used them at someone's house a year ago. Also, the boxes used to be a nice neutral gray and white pattern, blended with anything, but these!? It's like a committee was tasked with designing the ugliest, most noticeable combination of patterns and mismatched colors imaginable. Ochre yellow, pepto pink, and teal??! I'm currently looked for some sort of dispenser, because even if I had a towel bar to put these on (& I don't) there is no way I could live with the boxes as they are. Hence only the 3 star rating.

I use these towels in spite of their shortcomings.  They are too small to dry your hands thoroughly.  When they get wet, they won't dry your hands any more.  I always walk away from the sink with damp hands.  One advantage, they are much more sanitary than an ordinary hand towel.  If you have a lot of people in your home, they are not a good value.  But, they will help prevent the spread of illnesses.

I’ve order these a lot and they’ve always looked great.  The boxes are destroyed. Not happy, because I have these out in the open.  It’s fine for just us, but not guests.

I normally do not have a problem with buying these and love my value for the amount I spend. Yet this time I had ordered extra without realizing so I was giving 4 to my bestfriend and when I was having my daughter put them in her bathroom, the box was empty. Now I am worried out of my other boxes how many are empty. This was a tad bit upsetting when I saw this because I paid for 6 and only technically had 5.

Opened the box to find there were only 5 individual boxes instead of 6.  Lesson learned to open the package as soon as it arrives.  It’s too late to return or request a refund.

The boxes are very colorful.  Other than that, I was not pleased and will probably not use these.  I feel paper towels work better for absorbency.  The boxes were not damaged enough that they could not be used, but they were dented enough not to be attractive.  Since they are Kleenix brand, I thought I would be pleased.

They are just ok. If we had the towel bar to put them on, it would make taking them out of the dispenser much easier. I am just trying to keep everyone safe here and we had several people for a late Christmas, so I purchased them for that purpose. Not wanting to use a hand towel for everyone. Not sure I would purchase them again unless I had the towel bar, and I'm not sure where to purchase, since you would need an exact size.

I love Kleenex hand towels to stop the spread of germs. A clean, fresh, dry hand towel every time. However, these boxes are ugly! Pretty, colorful boxes would be nice to match bath decor! How about blues & teal?

After considerable delay, I received these paper towels today, expecting them to be in boxes angled (as pictured) to fit on a towel rack. These are packaged in rectangular boxes very similar to facial tissue. Although disappointed, I'm not sending them back. I just have to place them in an alternative place for dispensing.

Received a case of paper towels and one of the boxes was sealed and empty!  The towels are OK.  For the price, it’s probably better to put out a roll of paper towels.  Read the reviews!

The product themselves are fine. When I got my box though it was already open.

I’ve ordered these from Amazon before without any issues.  Today’s order arrived inside a large box, but the actual case of hand towels was damaged.  All six boxes were damaged.  I’m not going to waste time sending them back due to a need for the towels right now. However, it really defeats the purpose of ordering decent looking disposable hand towel dispensers if they’re all beat up.

Boxes come open which I just tape. Box designs/colors are awful; minus 1 star. The price is not good; minus 1 star. These can be purchased at most grocery stores for $2.50 a box in better colors and designs, so even with subscribe and save, the price is still awful, especially since you are buying in bulk at 6 packages per shipment!

Not a great value need to be around 1.50 a box to be economical. Average person could not afford to keep supplied.

Really like this product.  Have purchased several times over the past year.  This most recent order was missing a box, received only 5 boxes inside the master carton.

during this pandemic, instead of hanging a hand towel in my guest restroom, I thought I needed this.  It's a good idea, but I realized it's just paper towels inside a fancy box.  60 towels/box were used up in less than a week, then this item become pricey.

I ordered the Kleenex brand after having used Vanity brand disposable hand towels. Big difference, and not to the good! Comparatively, Kleenex hand towels don't hold a candle to Vanity as they are thin and flimsy. Wish I had not bought the six-pack box because I can't stand to use these long enough to use them up. I'll give them away.

I would normally rate a 5......We like these and use them in our RV as we travel.  However, this shipment has an issue.  You have to pull each towel apart, which is aggravating and not typical.  So this make me wonder is this is why the cost was less that what they usually are.

Product I received not what was pictured in photo. Received the commercial Kleenex hand towels, not the household grade Kleenex box that was pictured. Commercial towels have many more in box but are lesser quality (harder and thinner).

Amazon did not even put these towels in a secure box, just thrown into a large box so when they arrived each one was destroyed.  Could not even use the box as the sides were all busted up.

I believe the package could be better marked as to not disposing  of them in the toilet. There is only one small illustration on the box and kids and adults need something more visual as we are so used to throwing kleenex, TP, etc in the toilet.

I prefer to use in guest bathroom, especially during cold and flu season.  So much better than nasty reused fabric bathroom hand towels.

I ordered the box of 6 expecting 2 of each design. Only one box of the design I especially wanted came in the order. Disappointing.

This pack of 6 boxes arrived fine, and I love the product. But when I got to the 5th box, I realized it was totally empty, and still sealed. Check them all when they arrive, b/c I'm now past the "return" window!

When I opened shipping box, there were only 5 boxes of Kleenex, not 6!  Not a biggy, after reading some of the reviews, some people gave,,  but I paid for 6..

Unpacked when they arrived only to find the decorative boxes were all beat up and dented in on the sides.

Box inside was crushed and all 6 hand towels are crushed somewhat. Have ordered before and not had this happen just subscribed to this item will decide after next shipment. These are displayed in bathroom for guests to use!

These Kleenex Hand Towel boxes are "SECONDS."The decorative box sides are not glued correctly like the ones bought in a store.

It's convenience use in the bathroom especially when you have guest visit. Quality is ok, but price is very high, wish it can be cheaper.

cost & softness.

They were smaller than I expected.  I was wanting nice, large thick type.  These are small,  near Kleenex size, thin and not great at all. Really disappointed.

Nice option for hand drying in a bathroom setting but there should be more towels per box since it takes about two towels for every one hand washing to truly dry your hands.

Good product, but seems they are now using thinner material towels.

I like that they come out one at a time like a tissue box but they are much smaller than I expected.

Received five packs, not six and one pack was completely empty, although it was sealed and unopened.  Quality control needed!!  The lightweight box should've been obvious.  Disappointed!!

HATE THE NEW DESIGNS!!! Bring back the old ones please #kleenex The old solid colors at least looked more subtle than the gody looking gold marble designs!

got to say, I have just been a lucky shopper lately Lol.   First and foremost, everybody has been so helpful in their reviews.  It has really helped me make better buying decisions this Holiday Shopping Season.   I decided I wanted to make sure I left detailed feedback on some of the purchases I made in the Fall; with the hopes that I might help someone else.  I thought I was going to be leaving the good the bad the ugly.  But, I can't find a bad thing to say about these disposable hand towels.    When I decided that I wanted something like this, for bedside; I was thinking of it, as a luxury purchase, paper towels dispensed one at a time, fancy.   It turned out, that right from the beginning, this pack of 6 individual boxes of the Kleenex Expressions hand towels in the one at a time box, was a good value.       When they arrived and I started using them, I realized just what a gem I had found.  These are amazing.   They truly are a 3 in 1 product.           They are as durable as any premium paper towel on a roll I have ever used.  So, they work great wet, as a cleansing cloth.   They're very absorbent, one towel dries your hands and forearms thoroughly without falling apart.     They have this stretch to them & are perfect for holding a sandwich or some chips.  Sometimes, I hate to throw them away, the hold up so well.      After using them to hold a snack, I'll often rinse my hands when I'm done eating, dry them with the same towel, & then take the damp towel and wipe down my tablet.  Absolutely lint free glass cleaning!  That's use number 2 or 3 and why they would be amazing in the woodshop or the car!    Thirdly, and this is the best part for me, they are crazy soft.  I got a 6 pack of tissues at the same time I ordered these, but these towels are truly just as soft as these tissues.       I absolutely love that.  I have been forever looking to find a tissue that could hold up to being used like a napkin, when the need arises, in the car or the bedside or kids room.     But, wow, a sturdy, lint free paper towel, that is as soft and gentle on my delicate nose, a paper napkin, that IS as soft as a tissue, is eve even better.      I know I am going to be obnoxious about trying to get my family to try these.   But I can't help it I always thought it was a problem to solve (tissue falls apart / paper napkins are rough) and now I've found a solution.          SO far so good with not irritating my sensitive skin, but it is early days for that.  SO, I will update about that when I've gone through a few boxes.  This box is lasting me a long time.  I keep thinking I am finding excuses and using too many.  But that just goes to show you go through towels that can't do the job much faster.       I have medical issues and spend a lot of time in my bedroom, so those are great uses for me.  I would say the average household would love these in the bathroom, where you guests and family can pull out just one clean towel after washing their hands.   They don't need to touch a hand towel and the don't need to contaminate a whole role of paper towels trying to get one.   SO great for kitchen, bathrooms, laundry rooms, nurseries and my favorite place bedside.   But, be warned once your guests have felt how soft they are, they'll be reaching over the tissue box and grabbing one of these if they feel a sneeze coming on.

These are soft enough to use on the face, but the absorbency is good enough for the hands. Size is not too large and not too small; one is enough. The box art is colorful and comforting, its size compact, dispensing works as it should one at a time with towels easily removable, and it doesn't expose the towels below to water. You don't need to purchase a separate dispenser and can recycle the cardboard box. Don't throw away your cloth hand towels, but for guests or when you want to use paper these are useful, substantial, and convenient.

Kleenex Expressions Disposable Paper Hand Towels have been a game-changer in my household, especially with the chaos of kids and constant germ spreading. These little wonders are like superheroes in the battle against germs. They offer convenience with a friendly touch, ensuring a quick cleanup without the hassle of constantly laundering hand towels.  Let me repeat, to those busy Moms out there: no more constant laundering of those dirty hand, kitchen, or bathroom towels!What's truly remarkable is how (PSA: in my opinion only) they limit the spread of germs. It's like having a secret weapon against those invisible invaders.  When friends and all the neighbor kids constantly are running in and out of our house, I feel more confident in maintaining a clean environment.With the caveat of a higher price tag, the peace of mind and the reduced risk of illnesses circulating in the house is priceless. Plus, the stylish designs on the towels add a touch of flair to the otherwise mundane task of hand drying. If you're looking for a practical and effective solution to minimize hand towel washing and maximize clean hands all around, these disposable paper hand towels are worth every penny. Highly recommended for households where hygiene and convenience are top priorities!

These are fantastic and decorative to have in my bathroom when I have company. Reduces the amount of hand towel changes in washing. Very sanitary.

We’ve used Kleenex brand hand towels for a few years, mostly the large box with a stiffer but equally absorbent Kleenex towels.  But this version has flipped it!  I never knew you could turn it upside down and place it through the top of your towel rack and pull the towels out from the bottom. Bingo!  Try these. We don’t use to completely replace a washable hand towel, but the single use towel is a great option.

I got these for my two bathrooms so my kids can stop using hand towels or paper towels to dry their hands. They’re tough enough to absorb and soft enough to wipe your face without hurting your skin. My kids say they smell like Doritos Cooler Ranch and they swear by it. I… I just don’t know. There is a slight smell to them that I can’t really place, but it’s not anything that would stop me from buying these again.

I love these. They are great for my guest bathroom and absorb well. The only thing I'd change is to make the boxes solid colors like cream, white, green, or pink. The hideous patterns don't go with any of my decor. In that way, it's kind of embarrassing to have them in the guest bathroom. Will be looking for a replacement as I just can't do the ugly packaging.

This hand towel is superior in softness and absorbency. I'm glad I ran into this product since it's been really helpful to have in our bathrooms. It can absorb a good amount of water quickly, reducing the number needed per use. It is hygienic due to single-use which reduces the risk of cross-contamination compared to cloth towels, which can harbor bacteria if not laundered frequently.I also find these towels to be versatile. It is useful not just for hand drying but also for cleaning spills and wiping surfaces when disinfecting the bathrooms. There are no dispenser issues encountered because the box it came with can easily be flipped over and it dispenses the single-use towel.  For the cost, I find this reasonably priced for a medium-sized household like ours.

I started purchasing these disposable hand towels after an elderly family member moved in with us and we noticed our hand towels getting really grimy and I didn’t want to dry my clean hands on them. I keep a box of these hand towels under every sink.They’re thick  and absorbent, unlike the ones provided in most public restrooms, so it only takes 1 to fully dry your hands. You could opt to use paper towels instead, but these are definitely softer and like tissues are dispensed one at a time. They’re actually sturdy enough that after I use one to dry my hands, I usually also use it in to wipe down bathroom surfaces to keep things clean and also so I don’t feel as wasteful for using disposable paper products. They don’t pill or break apart, so they’re excellent for tidying up. The boxes are also cute.

I love these hand towels.  I've been using them for years!  They are a good size and one is good enough to dry your hands.  They are soft and are absorbent.  I think they are a great way to stop germs from spreading.  I just don't like the concept of everyone using the same towel in the bathroom to dry their hands, and because it gets so much use it's always a little damp.  And who knows how well everyone is washing their hands?  And then company is using the same towel.  And who knows how well they wash their hands.  And even though that towel may need to go to the laundry, no one is going to do it, except me so it becomes my responsibility.I feel like in my household, we are not sick often and even when someone gets sick it is easier to contain to one person (except when the kids refuse to stay out of each other's faces even though their sibling is obviously sick- that doesn't help).  I believe these hand towels do help to keep us well.I have them on subscribe and save and never have to worry about running out or lugging them home from the grocery store.

Use on my guest bathroom. Would purchase again

I keep a box on the vanity in my guest bathroom for those that prefer a personal towel after hand washing.The box is bigger than what would fit on my towel rack and would have  given five stars but for that.  The price on these was good compared to what I would pay in a grocery store.

One of the boxes was completely empty. no towels!

Buying in bulk👍

Love the napkin set but I wish the print on the boxes was more simple or at least solid colors.

COVID sure did bring the greed out in organization's like Kleenex.  I love the product but the price is ridiculous.

Perfect for sink of guest bathroom. We bought these during the pandemic and have continued to use them so guests don’t have to use a common hand towel. They are sturdier than paper towels.

For guest bathrooms, instead of people using the same towel, use a box of disposable towels. Dries just as well and is more sanitary.

These are great,and surprisingly a better deal on Amazon than Target and Walmart.

Thinner than I thought they would be.

They are perfect. The only problem was 3 of the boxes had their corners crushed.

Good quality-Quantity could be more for cost

These paper towel boxes came in very handy for a kids Lego themed birthday party! Just unfortunate that one out of the six boxes did not contain any paper towels. Doh!

I’ve ordered these for 3 years or more. I love the product. They recently changed the outside box. They colors are too stark and don’t match anything. A simple white or grey option would be nice.I’m over here trying to think of a crafty way to cover up the gaudy box.

If you read the small print it will tell you that you won’t always receive the colorful ones you thought you were ordering

We ordered these for home dialysis and they are perfect for what we needed. Easy to dispense, cloth-like texture, and softer than the harsh paper napkins in public restrooms. There is a bit of an odd, light smell to them that is somewhat sour, maybe from being stored in the box, but they’re definitely not scented. It’s not enough to make me not purchase them since we only use for the hands and the scent doesn’t linger, but I wouldn’t use on my face for that reason. None of the boxes arrived empty, like some other reviews mentioned, that was the first thing I checked upon arrival. Will continue to purchase these.

Love this  product, however this set was way too flashy.....back to a softer look....I loved the previous ones I received.  It is a brilliant discovery for me, really cuts down on the laundry

Since Covid these are the new safe guest hand towel. They are convenient but too expensive!

I usually only use bounty paper towels; however, I saw these in the store one day and thought I would give a try.  I actually like using them.  The pop-up feature and quality of the sheets are what I like most.  I will continue to buy and use in the kitchen in addition to my bounty towels.

These paper towels are fantastic. We put them in all of our bathrooms. They are absorbadent and one usually does the trick. My only issue is they are a bit pricey on Amazon.

Papers easily fall apart if your hands are very wet.  Also difficult to get out of box.  I like to use them after my skin care very soft on face.

Great value...will recommend

These disposable hand towels are admittedly not the best option for the environment, nor are they the most budget-friendly or decorative.  But with health and safety issues being what they are, they are MUCH more sanitary than multiple people using the same hanging towel to dry their hands.  The box hangs upside-down on a standard towel rack for easy, pull-down access with wet hands, while the rest of the towels stay clean and dry - no fumbling with a roll of paper towels, or getting folded disposables wet (read: germy!) while trying to lift one off of a stack.  They're also thick enough that one towel does the job very well.  They're getting hard to find (just like most paper products these days) - I'd suggest stocking up now if you can.  My household won't be without them.

Nice and thick so you only need 1 at a time. I just wish more came in each box.

... more expensive, and boy, do i hate the box.  if you buy in multiples, they don't stack unless you lay on their sides - it's annoying and wastes space in my pantry.  why not design a simple rectangular box like my old Viva towels (20% cheaper and sadly discontinued), or a regular Kleenex box?  otherwise, they are about the same size and softness.  just please, lose the angled top!

Worked it purpose, but over priced.

And great for avoiding towels used by family if you, or they, have a cold!I would like more of an assortment of colors and patterns of this group of 6 — only 1 is different, and only 2 other patterns for the other 5 boxes.

I love the size and convenience of the box...These are very convenient for bathroom hand drying. You can set them on the hand towel rail or on a counter.The paper towels are soft and absorbent. The only con is that sometimes they have a strange smell, which I really dislike and transfers to your hands when drying

Make sure to track prices, or check for deals, I've seen big price swing for this pack of 6 box.Use almost daily for a face, towels are soft, softer than usual paper towels, but smaller too, almost half size.

I really like this product but you’ve gone from $21 and $36 so I will not be purchasing again. I believe this is extremely high and I can get it somewhere else a lot cheaper surely did not expect us of Amazon.

Convenient, pop-up, pricey.

As I took out the six boxes of Kleenex Hand Towels, one of them was very light. It was sealed but totally empty. I think it was a manufacturing error.The other boxes are fine, are absorbent and soft and do a good job for drying hands or wiping down the faucet and countertop.

Not the best paper hand towels that I have purchased for my bathroom, but good enough.  I plan to repurchase.

These are handy towels, but I bought them to sit on top of the towel rack like they show in their advertisement,. But when I got the box and positioned it over my towel rack, it quickly fell between the rack and the wall and there was no way to get it to stay in the position that was planned, so now it just has to sit on the counter. The towels themselves are a little small, I would have liked them to be just a smidge bigger and I find myself wanting to grab a second one to really get my hands dry. I’m not sure that I’ll buy these again due to the fact that it would not sit on top of the towel rack

I use theseTowelettes to dry my face or wipe a quick spill. Quality however has changed, simply not as soft and the size has shrunk.

Love it for quick convenience for visiting kids & guests during COVID, but also hate it coz it's not made of resourceable source like Bamboo and is rather expensive too.  (However, I do "reclycle" all paper products on my end...so it does get reused)  Hopefully, KLEENEX is replanting a crap load of new Trees?

Using these for years. Price keeps going up and seems either thinner paper towels or fewer. Boxes slightly smaller, and run out faster.PERSONAL ISSUE: TISSUE BOX COLOR PATTERN & DECORATIONS.ALL LOOK PRETTY BAD.THE UGLIEST ARE ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS WHO HAVE "ALL NEW DESIGN" CHANGES.Case in point. The new print colors on the box are far uglier and can't imagine any going well with any color bathroom or decor.But it really doest matter. Just saying. :)

Out of 6 sealed boxes only 5 had paper towels in them.  1 sealed box was empty.  Other than that, very good soft paper towels.  Dries your hands really good!

I personally like using this over hand towels because of how sanitary these are. They are very absorbent and replacing it is easy. It would just be nicer if you got more towels for the price. I would still keep using these though.

Using in for 1/2 bath for guests, using on towel rack pull is convenient and no towels needed. They are soft and don’t fall apart. Fixed income or I would use them in every bathroom

there isn't anything to not like about these towels. the box design is such that you can set it upside down on a. towel. bar and get the towels as you need them. I use them when I'm soaking in the tub and watching a movie. I can easily keep my hands dry to change web sites and not. drip water on the. keyboard.

I like them very much. This is better than just providing guests with a paper towel roll. The slim package fits everywhere.

I like to use these disposable hand towels in my bathroom

I use these disposable hand towels in the bathroom and kitchen. It is convenient and easy to use. I order them from Amazon so that I never run out.

Awesome sellerHighly recommended!!

They are very  durable and use them foe our guest  I keep a box in my car.

I have used this product for many years. I am a messy guy but under control where ever I am

I have been using these for years and buying from another Retailer.  Recently saw them on Amazon website.  Same item - much better price!

I love these hand towels. They are so much nicer than a paper towel roll and easier to grab just one. The packaging is nice. It looks great on my counter without messing with a paper towel holder. They are absorbent and sturdy, great for pretty much any cleaning job or just drying your hands.I do a lot of sourdough bread baking. An important thing people don’t realize is that you don’t want sticky dough to go down your drain as it can turn into dough cement. So I use these paper towels to get most of the leftover dough out of the bowl and utensils. I bake several times a week so I go through quite a few hand towels and after trying different kinds of paper towels, I liked these the best.

I have 3 sons and they are always soaking the hand towel and knocking it off the towel ring. These are perfect to use in their bathroom. One and done! No more soaked hand towel.

I normally don't like to use disposable towels, but these are great guest towels for company.  When I'm home alone, I air dry and re-use.

I will never stop using these towels. They are great to clean with or dry your hands with.

Excellent product

It’s the little things that matter and this was a BIG hit at my baby shower. I had over 100 people and using a towel for people to try their hands just didn’t seem right. These one time use, disposable were perfect for cleanliness. Their quality is great. Thick and don’t rip as they get wet. This is worth your money.

Just what the title states. I have been married for 52 years, if she likes a product, I buy it for her. Shooting for 53.

Nice weight towels.  Each guest has their own towel...not a wet one with someone else's germs

Great for having guestsMuch easier and more convenient than having few hand towels and keep washing them everyday

I love this product! Instead of reusing a hand towel to dry, you get a fresh clean pop up towel. More sanitary and in a pretty little container.

On time and as described

Perfection! I use these as “Disposable Face Cloths” in place of a germ infested hand towel. Cute colors, great value for money, soft yet durable, the most sanitary way to sip your face off after cleansing!Can also be used as disposable hand towels in the kitchen and other places throughout the house. Lots of versatility with these individual towels.

These are great to use when company comes over instead of towels. They're absorbant and a good size. The boxes have pretty designs.

Love em. Far better than regular Kleenex.

Ever since I first tried these I am hooked.  I keep them in my bathroom and my guest bathroom.  Never have to wonder if a towel is clean for them to dry their hands.  I wish they came in more colorful boxes and/or solid colors.

You get a clean dry towel every time you pull one out of the box.

Love having these for guests to use or quick clean ups

Nobody wants to use a damp towel to dry clean hands! This is perfect for entertaining! Everyone gets to use a fresh towel! As oprah says...you get a towel you get towel and you get a towel!

handy on the boat, camping and picnics. Not as cheap as napkins but worth it. Will order again.

This was a 2nd order. Like these in guest bathroom. More sanitary.

These are great for small bathrooms or large bathrooms that don't have a place for a hand towel hook.

These did not seem like a practical purchase, but I love them. I put one in the guest bath. They are handy and you don't have to reuse a hand towel that someone else just used. I put a box by the front door and one in the kitchen during a family get together. Quick, handy easy to use. Nice little upgrade.

I have these on subscribe and save.  I use them for my guest bathroom.  More sanitary than towels when you are entertaining and have a higher volume of hand washing going on.  Great price compared to grocery store.

I was so happy when I found that I could still get these on Amazon.  I put them in the bathroom.  Every guest knows they have a clean towel.

Works great

Now that I found these I can’t live without them. They are so much better than reusing a dirty towel. They are on auto delivery and will be forever.

Use it as a hand towel in the rest room

A great replacement for real towels. No longer drying my hands 🙌🏽 on the same towel over and over

The product was as I epected

Less laundry and very easy to use

These are great to keep in the car. The thickness of the napkins are great but they are also soft! Great for car clean ups. My daughter gets car sick so it’s so nice to have these on hand. Great for big and small messes.

These are very durable and you only need one to dry your hands. They fit over the hand towel bar and you can buy containers that fit on the wall. I really don't like to use cloth hand towels as I have 4 little granddaughters and I'm never sure how thoroughly they have washed their hands. I feel these towels greatly limit the spread of gems. Very satisfied with them and highly recommend.

We typically order this product every 3-6 months and haven't had this issue before. The box came sealed, but there was no parchment paper inside. We have had dented or damaged boxes lately, but empty is ridiculous. Amazon told me to contact Reynolds, Reynolds told me to contact Amazon. I realize at the end it's only a few dollars, but their quality control needs a recheck. We use this paper for most oven baking and it works really well. We usually prefer to buy the Reynolds brand for it's better quality, but this may force me to start buying a different brand in stores.

It says 15” above the image, and I ordered it based on that description.  What arrived was a box of 12” parchment.  I even returned/replaced it thinking it was a warehouse picker error, but the replacement was identical.  Upon reading the blurb below the item more carefully, i realized that the vendor describes it there as 12” wide.I could have ordered their actual 15” big roll, but was so irritated at the false listing that I found what I needed from a different manufacturer.  Excellent woodpulp unbleached parchment, which arrived in a wonderfully sturdy box with supersharp cutter for the same price as the 15” Reynolds (which evidently arrives in a crushed box, according to multiple reviews).  So I got lucky.

Have ordered this parchment paper many times and the package it comes in is always undone. Will not order again.

I normally love unbleached more environmentally friendly products, but this one is not good at all. The box's razor side isn't sharp enough at all so the paper can't be ripped out well. The paper itself isn't very non stick and oils and such soak into it. Kinda hard to explain other than that but I really disliked this product.

I like the parchment paper but the box or whatever you wanna call it it’s terrible!! It always falls apart and when I go to cut my paper it always rips terribly crooked! I end up having to use scissors and cutting it myself! It’s not an isolated incident this has happened several times with this particular parchment paper! They need to package it better!

This was omitted from my package so I bought some at the store.

3rd time ordering this item. 3rd time box arrived crushed. Improved packaging necessary

Sent me an opened product.

This product is not non stick and leaks through to pan

This parchment paper is functionally fine, but the cutting line does not cut the paper very well at all. Every time I want to rip off it's a rip off part of the parchment paper I have to use scissors or a knife to cut it.

This product was shipped in an envelope vs a box and as a result one end of the package is damaged.  The roll of parchment paper is still good, but it doesn't dispense properly out of the box/package that it comes in.

Grease just goes right through to the other side and sticks to the baking sheet.  What's the point?Going back to aluminum foil.  Maybe I can find some type of craft to use the rest of this roll for.

Beware-this paper caught my kitchen on fire! The directions say it is safe for up to 425°. I was cooking rolls at 350° in my oven caught on fire from this paper, will be returning!

The package was delivered smashed. I never got the credit for it either

I was in a hurry to add something small to meet a minimum, and this seemed appropriate.  Should have looked more closely.  This is not normal parchment paper; it is MUCH narrower, so it runs the other way on a cookie sheet and you go through a lot more.

The box was already open when I received it.

This parchment paper is too thin for this price. Local stores have better one. Don’t buy this.

Better double it up

My parchment paper arrived with the box broken open at both ends and smelling of mildew. It looked like something they found in the garbage and threw in an envelope.  There's no way I'm cooking food on this.

I’ve never had such difficulty using a product, and I’ve been a professional cook. The cutter mangles the paper, there’s no clean cut which is essential for successful parchment cooking. Get the one at the 99¢ store instead.

Won't buy again.

It’s not sturdy but will do fine for cookies.

The products is all open and damage i dont understsnd  now i cant even tear the paper in a proper way .Whats going kn with the package this days.

Box was torn open on arrival. I dont think any was missing inside but I do not like open products much less if I am going to place food on them. Recommend another brand.

Product arrived crushed

The parchment paper was torn upon delivery. Looks like it had been used before. Can't seem to upload a photo of how I received it though.

damaged, also first order was 3>49 and second was $2.29. Same product , what the hell?

Box was all smashed up ... considering parchment paper needs it’s box for the life of the roll I am disappointed!!

So thin that my food burned through it. I will try doubling it next time, but I'm really disappointed.

Horrible product, sticky to cake and peal off the skin. Buy good one from Wholefoods instead!

ITS LIKE A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER  THE OIL WENT RIGHT THROUGH

The product did not look brand new and the package on both ends were half open.

The oven temperature is less than 400°

Box was open and parchment was in the bottom of the packing.

Not wide enough to cover cookie sheet & packaging not sturdy enough for shipping process

The package was opened when I received it.

The parchment box and wrapping were smashed and torn on arrival...

The amazon box was empty when it arrived

Received it with damaged packaging

The product is unusable!!!

Old product

Box was opened, and crushed.

An EPA-certified lab found Reynolds and Kirkland parchment papers contained PFAS, indicated by the presence of fluorine at levels of 14ppb and 12ppb respectively. // 'If You Care' parchment paper was not found to contain any PFAS. // PFAS are often called "forever chemicals" because they cannot be removed or cleaned from the human body after exposure. PFAS are surfactant chemicals often used in non-stick and stain-resistant products. A recent review from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlines a host of health effects associated with PFAS exposure, including cancer, liver damage, decreased fertility, and increased risk of asthma and thyroid disease.

Seems like was a returned item that was open and may have a small amt removed

I'm not sure why the packages I've been receiving have been damaged? I received 2 of the Reynolds parchment paper rolls and both were completely opened and the boxes were severely damaged.

The product was damaged when it was delivered

No quibbles with the paper itself. On the box it states: Paper is made in Germany, Packaged in the USA. So paper has been made in Germany then shipped to America to be put in a single cardboard box and then transported back to Europe and my home in the UK. WHY??? The fact that the item is unbleached and compostable is dwarfed by the amount of miles it has travelled. Shame on Amazon for selling it!

This is the only parchment paper we buy in my house. I like that it's not bleached / dyed. Makes cooking and the cleanup from cooking much easier where applied. I mostly use it to line pans/dishes for baked goods and to line baking sheets when cooking things in the oven. It works fine with my ovens air fry setting too BUT the package states there is a temp limit of 425° for the product -  do not use it in the oven /air fryer above that temp or for any broil setting, as doing so will make the paper smoke/burn.

This was a perfect fit for my cookie sheets for baking and also to use in my Dutch oven for pizza.

Makes baking sheet cleanup easy and mess free, and the cookies won't stick to the baking sheets when using parchment paper. I'll be using this every time I bake cookies from now on.

I used this on my stove top to keep it from scratching and clean.It is perfect.Also, use it to separate frozen steaks, and chops in the freezer.

The problem though is the packaging, its not very user friendly when it comes to staying in place with the push in tabs for it to unroll with. But the parchment paper does exactly what it's supposed to.

Very good parchment paper for baking and everyday kitchen use.

I started buying the natural parchment paper for less toxins.

As expected. No problems

In kitchen. Could easily cut or shape for different sized pans or dishes. Use mainly in air fryer.

Great parchment paper! Non-stick, durable, and heat-resistant. Perfect for baking and cooking. Easy to use and eco-friendly. Highly recommend!

This is great parchment, it does the job well, but it’s a bit narrow and doesn’t reach the edges of my pan like some other brands do.

This is a great price for parchment paper but the cutting part is terrible.  It’s not sharp like the one I have at home.  The box also came opened.  Amazon needs to pack better!

Very nice paper, but the box fell apart the moment I opened it, and it's a real pain to try to tear it off while simultaneously trying to hold the package together

Probably the worst parchment paper I’ve used.  It’s very thin and the box cutter doesn’t work well.  My box arrived broken on both ends.

This box of parchment paper was opened in the front and on the side. It was inside another box so hopefully has been protected.

Unable to use package for clean tear, box was completely destroyed upon arrive (no damage to shipping box). Have to use scissors every time I need a piece

Work well the candy not sticking to papers

It’s better to be bleached.

As far as the parchment paper it's great. The only issue I have is how Amazon shipped it. The boxes the product come in are not shipping boxes they are display and item use (cutting paper with built in edge) boxes. These need to be protected from the harsh environment that is shipping. Sending these in a plastic bag was an error in judgement. The product is great the box is now garbage so base your desicion on how you like the packaging the product comes in.

I generally use a different brand, in a bind I bought this...never again. Really thin parchment paper. Just not quality.

I received this in a box with a few other things.  I already know something was gonna be broke because I could hear my little items clanking around in the box with I picked it up.  I was so annoyed this $5+ box was unusable.  The box has the cutter on it!  both ends were so damaged I had to remove the roll of parchment paper and I am currently having to use scissors to cut it.  Don't think I'll be buying this again.

Product box was opened upon receipt. Thinking this may have been a used item.

Reading the reviews I notice most pictures of box have the ends torn open.I tried to use the tabs on the ends to secure the roll, but the ends tore before the perforation.  Shame on you, Reynolds, for making the perforation stronger than your glue.So I bring out the tape.

Got it with broken box!!!But parchment paper is okay

I was not going to bother myself about writing review on this. But after having used it for a while, now at the end of a roll, I felt that I really want to share my experience with others (and the manufacture if they are reading this).The product itself is ok. I have no complaints about the quality of the product.The problem is the cutter! The cutter is horrible. It is very very difficult to use, and it barely worked. Many times I have to use scissors to cut it. Other times, I was prepared to waste a bit of the paper when I  was using the cutter because I was too lazy to use the scissors.But we cannot get the paper /the product without using the cutter!In short, I will not buy this product again.

I purchased this needing the white/clear, but this is brown.  My mistake.  It is not very waxy?  I thought it should have a heavier layer of was on one side.  Both sides look almost identical.

The box was torn at the end so it makes it difficult to pull the paper out.

Maybe too non-stick.  Unbaked cookies slid off with a slight tip while putting tray in oven.  I will not likely purchase this product again.

I ranked this how I did bc of the box being destroyed. The parchment paper itself was perfect and has no tears or anything. However the box was completely unusable. Torn at the sides and flat.

Sorry. 3 stars for shipping ( box was mangled and roll slightly out o round. Shipped in plastic bag. Rerounded the tube and  put in a foil box when emptied. Product works well,

I use parchment for baking bread at high temps in dutch ovens.  this one isn't up to the task.  the paper sticks to the wetter dough and fuses to the bread when it bakes.  it also rips with the weight of the bread after a single use.  Works fine for cookies, but isn't as robust as basic reynolds standard stuff.  The box is similarly weak, and completely not up for cutting the (admittedly thin and wimpy) paper.  Wish I could find an unbleached option that stood up to serious use. sigh.

Box came damaged so harder to use the cut function and keep the roll entact

It’s rather flimsy.

I have used Reynolds Parchment for years.  I got the Unbleached type this time but it is nearly impossible to rip cleanly with the box it comes in.  I have to switch it out into my foil box to get a good line.

these work just fine but they are an odd size. when baking with other parchment papers, they are usually very close to the size of standard cooking/ baking sheets. these however are an odd size and i find myself having to cut off and waste more parchment than with the bleached parchment with the grid printed on it

Each time i used the paper burned!

but it came broken in the middle of the item (both the case and the paper roll inside, and as a consequence, I cannot cut it using its metal blade. I had to use the scissors to cut it when using it.

Just ok. Not as good as brand name. Tears easily and sticks to things it shouldn’t stick to. Fine if you need something quick and cheap.

Nice decent parchment paper, real non-stick but poor package. Mine had shampoo on the out box so I had to throw the box away.

Grease goes through it and the cutter on the box is a joke.  It is also too narrow for many cookie sheets

Does not cut good with the built in cutter Very frustrating to use!!!

It keeps my fruit from spoiling and smells good in the fridge, but it's a bit brittle

just soso

The product itself may be ok but the way it arrived it ridiculous!

Seems to get burnt edges. Doesn’t hold up as some parchment paper that is not unbleached.

It could be perfect if the blade actually workEd! What a disappointment

Very thin paper.  I prefer a thicker paper.

It says 'unbleached' but read the very small letters: only partially.

Not great. Oil seeped through.

Just by the Reynolds.  You'll like it better.

shrinkflation

Box came a little banged up, and the blades to cut the parchment paper are unusable. It’s a minor inconvenience, but it still works fine. I think I’ll just buy it from the grocery store next time.

The box of the parchment paper is too soft and it is difficult to tear the paper.  I have to use a scissor to cut it, very inconvenient.

I opted for the unbleached parchment paper in the hopes that it would not be coated with silicone but unfortunately all Reynolds parchment papers are coated. It does help prevent sticking but I wish there was better transparency so that it was upfront on the package. This still works well and is cheaper online than the drugstore.

Not easy to use at all. Hard to keep the sheets organized.

Nothing wrong with actual product.  They packaged this in an envelope and I received it crushed, which makes it difficult to pull out paper when needed.

If you have your own either stainless steel or metal dispenser for the roll it would be better and take it out of that cheap container

The paper itself works as expected, but the serrated edge is useless and the box is made from cardboard so soft it doesn't hold its shape, so using it to cut the paper is impossible and I have to use scissors every time.  I'm all in favour of recyclable materials for packaging, but they have to actually work for their purpose first.

very small roll

Seems okay, I haven't tried it to see if food sticks to it or not.

This is a good parchment paper. It's also unbleached, which I like and appreciate. This will last me a very long time as I rarely use it, but when I want to bake some scones or biscuits, cookies or brownies, or something I don't want to stick to a pan, this works great.

Switched from foil to unbleached paper for health reasons. One roll lasts a long time. Much healthier than aluminum foil.

Good quality.

The Rweynolds Unbleached Parchment paper is easy to use.  It comes in a roll, like their other wraps, with a perrforated side which makes it easy to cut/ tear to the size you need.  I personally do not like it as well as their other parchment, or other brands I have purchased (comparative photos will be added).  The surface is a bit waxy, like waxed paper.  It does perform well.  I have not had an issue with it burning, even at high heat (475).It is a slightly more slick surface than I am used to.  The only way that it differs in performance, that I have noticed, is that when I sprinkle cornmeal or semolina on it, it slides around a bit, does not stay where I put it.  Using parchment, the corn meal is not strictly necessary.  I still use it sometimes when I want the texture or crunch, and it does add something, especially to multi-grain breads.It makes oven transfers easy, both sliding it onto a hot baking stone and removing it when it is done.  I suppose as I get used to the slightly different texture I will find ways in which one is better than the other for different projects.  Right now I am still getting used to its' having a slightly different feel.

I appreciate the environmental consciousness behind Reynolds' unbleached parchment paper. It's great to see a product that's both responsibly sourced and compostable. The oven-safe feature up to higher degrees is handy for most of my baking needs, and it fits well in standard baking pans. However, it's not entirely flawless in performance. Nonetheless, it's a step in the right direction for eco-friendly kitchen products.

The product works as described, I like the fact that it is unleashed and compostable, however, giving it 4-stars as it has a flimsy box and cutter, I have to manually cut it every time.

I received the paper roll, but the box was crushed.  The roll appeared to be fine; but I will have to cut the paper with sizzlers, because the cutting edge it bent.

Overall it’s a five, but giving it a four because the packaging have already fallen apart on me. It’s so hard to get the paper to rip on the metal teeth, too. The paper is great but the packaging needs to be stronger

Like the size. Works great for my baking needs

Meets the purpose

I like the smaller size ,there is less waste.

Listen it's parchment paper. But if you're baking something and you don't want your food to stick to the pan this gets the job done. I also like that it's composable so at least if we're going to use it really good for the environment

The paper does was it's supposed to but there are a few quirks. Sometimes it rolls up on it's own after putting it down. When cooking with larger/heavier meat you're going to want to use layers because it's not the thickest paper, it can tear after cooking making cleanup a little messy.

Didn’t realize this was not as heavy as regular parchment paper. I’m assuming it’s because it’s compostable.

Easy tear off. One use goes a long way. Easy pan clean up. When using it as for bread, easy removal also. Easy clean up after a hard day of baking.

Surprisingly, they were better than the cookie sheets I normally buy.

I bought it for so many times, cleaning after BBQ is always a pain in the ass, with this only thing you need to do is throw it away and do some easy cleaning, also it won’t burn even with extremely hot temperatures (unless it directly contact fire source), only reason I’m giving four star is the packaging looks like it’s stock from a long time ago, but since it doesn’t expire so it’s ok for me, great product overall!

I use parchment paper in so many ways in the kitchen it really is a staple. Great for lining pans and helps with easier clean up

As expected

The product itself is fine but it was shipped in a padded envelope where it only just fitted diagonally.  This caused it to arrive slightly squashed.  The paper itself is fine but because the 'blade' (the sharp bit of the box) has been bent it doesn't tear very well.  If you look towards the end of my unboxing video you can see the effect.

The box seems a bit flimsier than usual.  May be a flaw in this particular batch but I don't remember the packaging folding and distorting so much while trying to dispense the product with other types of Reynolds items I've had.

However, it does the job of parchment paper and it's a good price. I don't care if it's compostable or not, only price matters for me. Your oven can't be higher than 425 degrees either.

Like some other reviewers mentioned, the product itself is okay. But it is very hard to use the cutter, which is frustrating if you need just the right size for the baking sheet. But if you don’t mind that, it is a good product overall.

This package was great to use, simple and ease to unpack. Great for cooking, better than some of the others I've tried out from supermarkets.  Works really good in pans and baking sheets, nothing sticks and and easy to clean pans afterwards.

Multi purpose.:-)

Its box is dusty, looks old. I threw the box right away. Fortunately, the box is not opened, and the paper works very well. I used it for baking glutinous rice cake. It's not sticky.

If u need parchment paper this will do the job

Seems like food doesn't slide off as well as the regular parchment paper. I made caramels and used these as wrappers and they kind of stuck.

Excellent for craft use. I make book covers from melted plastic bags, and they have yet to stick to this parchment. Also love that it's made of recycled material.

It’s a little more expensive than the original stuff. Not really much point to go this way compared to others but that’s just me. Slightly more cost just isn’t justified imho

This is a good product, however the choice of packaging for shipment resulted in a broken box, so the box is no longer functional.

I don't like the color, but the quality is ok, and it is cheap, so is ok for me.

Like most 'tear-off' items, mechanics of tearing off cleanly need improvement.  That said, does the job of parchment paper without flaw.

It's very comfortable than I thought and it is reasonable price.  Thanks.

Different size than what's available in the Supermart. Works well for bread pan.

there were no sticking or tearing. I used it for cauliflower pizza and banana nut bread and I loved it

Product work great, need to improve the package 📦 stronger

*Parchment Paper, a Haiku*It gets the job done.It doesn't get too crispy.Ecofriendly box.

the package looks like it is 5 years old

Good parchment paper but when it came box was broken.

Ease to clean and use

can be cleaned and reused most time

Easy to use and good quality.

makes my pan so sticky after using it

Decent product as well as the price !

Worked for the purposes I purchased it for.

Great to have

good as expected

I can keep my food from sticking to my pans, so good job!

Ok

Yes, parchment paper can be used for baking And air frying. It can be cut in any size. Very easy cleanup  Makes makes Cooking a pleasure.

got this at a good price and the paper is working out just fine for my baking adventures.

Save world from plastic and aluminum. The bake foodsare better

I recently tried Reynolds Kitchens Unbleached Parchment Paper, and overall, I'm quite impressed with its performance. The unbleached paper is sturdy and non-stick, making it perfect for baking and cooking various dishes without worrying about them sticking to the pan.One of the standout features of this parchment paper is its eco-friendly aspect. Being unbleached, it's a more environmentally conscious option compared to traditional bleached parchment paper. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm making a more sustainable choice for my kitchen.However, there are a couple of drawbacks that prevent me from giving it a perfect rating. Firstly, the packaging could be improved. The box design makes it difficult to dispense the parchment paper smoothly, often resulting in tearing or uneven cuts. It would be great if Reynolds could redesign the packaging to ensure a more user-friendly experience.Additionally, the cutter built into the box doesn't work as effectively as I'd hoped. It tends to get stuck or jammed, making it frustrating to use. I often find myself resorting to scissors instead, which defeats the purpose of having a built-in cutter.Overall, Reynolds Kitchens Unbleached Parchment Paper is a high-quality product that performs well in the kitchen. However, I hope to see improvements in the packaging and cutter design in future iterations to enhance the user experience.

It has been great because I bought two other bleach free papers and they both burned and stuck

This is a good thing to have when using the air fryer so food doesn't get stuck or greasy on the pan. I cut it to adjust to the size of the air fryer pan and then cook the food on top. One time and done. Very useful.

This is my preferred brand for parchment paper

Good price so I brought from Amazon.

This is my first time using this product and I'm sold on it it's amazing. I'll definitely buy again. 👏🏾 Thank you very much!

Good product

This works great for baking cookies, putting a pizza on it only inside of the oven, lining baking pans, & for use in the air fryer.Saves me a ton of time on clean up.

As expected - good value for name brand

I was stocking up and I don’t use often but when I do it works great

I am satisfied with these papers for cooking cakes. It has a good quality.

pretty much what you expect from parchment paper. great :)

Best product to bake my patties

Good price and great paper

What baker/cook does NOT use parchment paper? I previously used the large cut sheets which required measuring and cutting. But this paper is on a roll like wax paper or a plastic film. Very convenient. And it has never failed me, always creating a barrier from burning pans and most importantly non-stick properties. I really love this parchment paper. :o)

I used it on cookie sheets, a pan that I made brownies in and an air fryer to make chicken wings and fries. I was totally pleased.

Best for bacon in the oven!!!

I love this for all my baking!  Easy to use and tolerates high oven temps too!

Works like partchnent paper.

I don't really find any difference between brands at all so I just shop the price, it came smashed in the packaging, but I didn't complain I just taped the ends and use it. I'm not that kind of person. The serration actually does cut it pretty easily. I would buy this no problem again.

Finally we made crispy mazah pizza and mazah brickle this year. Parchment paper helped immensely. Thank you Rennolds Wrap Parchment Paper. It's kosher u certified too!

Great paper

……and it does what parchment paper does. I cook a lot with parchment and happy with this product.

So many uses for cooking, baking or just heating up items.  Makes clean-up so much easier.  This brand a partchment paper is great.  Easy to tear off the size you need.  Well worth the price.

As described

Fast delivery and great price

This stuff is the perfect non stick liner for your over. Don't go over 425 or it gets crispy since its a paper product, but seriously nothing sticks to this. Makes clean up so easy!

perfect product great price I am sold totally on parchment paper

Used for many baking items. Worked as it should.

I have used Reynolds parchment paper for years. Great for baking  and it keeps the baking sheet clean. The box gives instructions  , and it tells you the maximum temperature you cam use the parchment.

Simply wet it first, then shape it as needed inside your airfryer.

Long time user of this paper and it has yet to let me down. Use it for all my baking needs; bread, cookies, brownies, bacon, you name it.Absolutely recommend getting it!

I am hooked on parchment paper! I love baking, but I am not the main cook in my household. I bought this for the chef who uses the toaster oven a lot for roasting potatoes and veggies, etc. Nothing sticks to the sheet and clean up is easy as pie!

Glad I got this one because the other Reynolds Swan the more traditional parchment paper doesn’t cook very well. It smells burnt. I’m cooking with this one. I didn’t have that issue and catch on fire. Everything is cooked well on it so I really recommend this product for safety and for a healthier way to cook.

I tried using Whole Foods paper towels for a while.  I decided I really didn't like them.  They were cheaper but they couldn't hold a 'sheet', to Presto.  Presto is much more absorbent, lasts longer, so in the long run they were actually cheaper. They are softer and easily configure for wiping counters or cleaning up a mess. They were sturdy and didn't tear.  When I indicated that I wanted them on this Subscribe and Save order, I got the email saying they were having a hard time filling them.  The morning they were on WOOT ( another Amazon Company), they sold out almost instantly.  Of course I was one of the ones who didn't get them. So, I switched to these, hoping they were Presto II, not. These towels remind me of the ones you used to get in airport or bus terminals in the sixties....on those rides to and from college.

It was hard to capture in the video while ripping a piece but you can clearly see how much dust is generated from ripping one of these under the sunlight. It was an accidental but shocking discovery one sunny afternoon in my kitchen. There was a ton of dust coming from the end of the ripped paper towel from shaking the detached piece as well (couldn’t attach that video due to file size limitation) We switched to a better brand immediately, and I genuinely hope Amazon will consider reengineering these for the better. I do not recommend these paper towels for families with small children, elders, folks with allergies, anyone with compromised health or has health concerns. Can you imagine how much dust we are breathing in just from using these paper towels on a daily basis?

These are terrible paper towels. I decided to try these because we needed paper towels and Costco was out. NEVER AGAIN. They are about the same as the worst paper towels at the grocery store. When you go to tear the towel, it literally NEVER tears on the creased line. It's junk. I'm not even a review writer  but it's 2 in the morning and I am up feeding my baby and was reminded yet again when I had to go tear a paper towel after washing my hands how much I LOATHE these paper towels How there aren't more bad reviews is beyond my understanding.  Amazon is probably skewing the reviews.Seriously.  DO NOT BUY THESE CRAPPY PAPER TOWELS.

Don't get me wrong, I know you get what you pay for but I was expecting at least great value but instead got the no name crappier versionThis is still a step above public bathroom paper towels but not aldis cheapestIf that's what your going for then that is great, just lower the priceAnd yes, as a bounty queen I should stick to what I know, bounty or member marks is where my loyalties should lie but money tight so I gave it a try and regretted

Don’t usually leave reviews much, but hope this helps buyers & hope it encourages Amazon to step the paper towels quality up some.  Same as the thin dollar store paper towels.Before using the paper towels, compared the sheets to cheap dollar store & Bounty.  Yep, thin like the dollar stores paper towels.  Then washed my hands and used one, was totally wet immediately, and the edge peeled into a 1” strip.  Did not expect Bounty or ViVa quality, but did not expect cheap low quality paper towels.  Here’s why… we tried the TP and thought it was a decent toilet paper between shredding cheap TP & soft Charmin like.  Happy with the TP, and will buy the TP again.  So, that is why we tried the paper towels.Well Amazon, hope your company raises the quality of your Amazon Basics Paper Towels, and land them in between Bounty & Viva quality and the cheap thin soft paper towels, of which these are.  Sending them back, and will try the Presto paper towels that has a better rating.Been happy with other Amazon Basics items, but think this is a miss step by Amazon on this item. Hope this info helps both buyers and Amazon.  Customer service was helpful.

The most comparable thing to these are those extremely cheap birthday paper towels that feel like you've picked up a piece of regular printer paper. They don't absorb anything, theyre flimsy and stiff, they rip apart constantly and are just miserable to use and all of that for not really saving much money. If you find a coupon for a couple dollars off of any brand, you'll be paying the same for much higher quality. Don't get these.

I usually get Amazon's Presto version of paper towels. Those are great but not current available for whatever reason. I'm guessing it's because they have warehouses full of this garbage version of paper towels and they needed to get rid of them. These are so thin and you need 20 of them to absorb anything. Save yourself time and money and go to the dollar store if this is the quality that you want.

These paper towels are horrible! They are barely more absorbent than a sheet of notebook paper. They don’t tear off cleanly, and every time you move the roll you will see a cloud of lint float off of them.  After my experience with these paper towels I am hesitant to try any other “Amazon” brand household items. Don’t waste your money. I will be sticking with Kirkland brand or Bounty.

Thought we would try these cheaper paper towels, boy what a mistake I made! I’m not opposed to cheaper paper towels, but these are just way too thin and I have to use three times as many each time I wash my hands. Just want Amazon to know that they are not thick enough and not good quality. For reference, members mark is a good cheaper option.

Amazon was out of stock on ,y regular subscribe and save paper towels and these were the substitute. I am very unhappy with them because they are awful- thin, plastic feeling, feels like something that came from the cheapest store imaginable. I don’t want to use them, but I don’t have any choice now since I’ve already used a couple of rolls.

This is the first review I have ever written! I think I’m just finally fed up with Amazon creating a horrible product then recommending it to all of us. These paper towels are 2 ply and they just separate themselves. They also make it so you waste 3 or 4 of them trying to peel your way to the first complete towel. Waste of time and money, super super cheap product! Just keep getting yours from Costco or wherever you usually get them, we are!

These are some of the worst paper towels I’ve ever bought.  They are extremely thin, break off partially when you’re tearing one off the roll of paper towels.  The price is good and is comparable to some store brands that I know are of good quality, but the quality of Amazon’s paper towels is suffering in comparison

I ordered these because it was going to be a while before I could make a Sam's trip and I figured they would be a good alternative.First off they were delivered by my mailman which was really quite sad to see him have to lug a big box of paper towels to my door. I assumed they would be coming by Amazon courier.Second, they are rough, scratchy, difficult to tear off cleanly and lack absorbency .  I have to use several to get the job done as opposed to the Sam's club brand and basic grocery store brands which are much more absorbent.I will be putting these in the garage and on the potting bench to be used there and definitely either go to Sam's or the grocery store to buy a better alternative for my kitchen. Very disappointing purchase.

I nearly got a hernia opening the box my paper towels came in!! The glue was so thick on the inside flaps OH MY GOODNESS!! I could not break the box down to trash it since we have zero recycle capacity where I live...so it goes in the trash. Amazon Stop with all the glue! Just seal as usual. I seriously could not flatten the box. I the power towels were good enough but won't order again to try to break the rolls out of prison!!OK and now to the paper towels! A huge disappointment. Come on Amazon!these paper towels are so thin and Non-absorbent I have to use half a roll to soak up spills.. they tear clumsily and are terrible. Actually at the Dollar stores you could find much better. Come on Amazon, poor folks should not endure this quality. However my hamster 🐹 does not mind me lining her cage with this.  Beats a 📰 newspaper which we hardly can find! Please do better

Was lazy and didn't want to make a trip to sams club. For reference we usually get members mark. These are not even 1/3 of the quality and were a little more expensive. Got these in 2 days ago and went to sams today because these are basically useless to us - VERY THIN

Is there the junkiest paper towels I have ever seen in my life. The target brand paper towels are only about a dollar more and our way thicker and higher quality. These are extremely thin, stiff, and it’s going to take twice as much paper towel to get the job done. Terrible quality!

I bought these because they SEEMED to be Amazon's replacement for the Presto! brand towels I usually get, but they are WAY thinner and weaker. I don't expect Viva-quality paper for bargain prices, but these are dollar store-level thin. Do not buy. Wait for Presto! to come back in stock.

Unfortunately I got a large multi roll pack. I decided to give these a try over the Sam's ones. I'm never deviating again. These feel terrible in your hands, don't absorb well, feel like a literal piece of paper, and don't tear well. I always end up not being able to tear them on the perferation. It is going to be a chore going through them before I let myself buy more of the Sam's brand. Wouldn't recommend.

What has happened to the quality of Amazon?? I run AIRBNB these were so easy to order when needed but the sheets separate on every roll, at 1st I thought I had a bad roll but its now been 2 entire packages I can't afford to purchase garbage on customers or on myself. Lets do better Amazon you lost me as a customer on several AIRBNB supplies that I use with your brand name.

Sorry bout that, but unfortunately, THUMBS DOWN!  I 'm Surprised that a product that Amazon puts its name on, because almost everything that We have purchased through you has been quality. These paper towels are so bad that I wanted to send the remaining 6-pack back to you, but we missed the return window. They are coarse, and so thin that they tear constantly, even when pulling them off of the holder. To make matters worse, when installing a roll on the holder, the tube insert separates from the roll and causes the roll of towels to bunch up to one end or the other., and is very frustrating. Maybe if you load up several rolls on a horizontal paper towel holder, you will understand. Thankyou, Jeff & Tamara Myers

I just don't like cheap paper towels. Of course I like a low price, and that is why I gave these a chance.  A little to cheap in the materials. Not absorbent enough. I like a towel you can really use and maybe even use it twice. With these there isn't any way possible unless you only wipe up water.  Not something I will buy again. 🙂  but thank you

I bought a trial 2 pack of these.  After working to get the glued end lose (much worse than most paper towels) I quickly saw and felt how very thin these are... not at all like most paper towels.  Then, I discovered that the inner cardboard circle has a very small diameter, and they won't even fit onto a standard paper towel holder dispenser.  Don't waste your money

Literally, the crappiest paper towels, EVER. I don’t know how much the other ppl were paid to say these good things about them. TOTALLY overpriced for the “quality” you get; huge letdown by Amazon. Might as well dry your hands with lined paper & save yourself some money😁

I wanted to try the paper towels out since they were a decent price. The quality is really bad. They're very thin and not very absorbent. It's actually on a par with tissue paper. You really do get what you pay for with these.

In my opinion these are the worse paper towels I have ever used.  They are very rough to the touch and they do not absorb anything more than a few drops of water or coffee before they begin to fall apart.

This is the worst product in its category. It is so extremely thin, the paper, that you need to fold about 4-5 times to get the smallest job done.It is not a deal at all.I will never buy this again.

Bought these on prime day and was excited to try them, but they were a major disappointment.  They are fairly rough, but the worst part is they don’t rip on the lines.  Each one rips off the top layer of the next sheet.  Very annoying and we stuck with thin, torn sheets.  Already decided we will never purchase again

It’s appears they are not perforated completely.  They will not tear without ripping.  They're also too thin and don’t pick up very well.  This purchase made me realize how big a difference there can be between paper towels.

These paper towels, if that’s what you can even call them, are horrible. They are intriguing because of the price but it is not worth it. You’ll be using at least 2-3 towels at a time to even dry your hands, don’t even think about cleaning up a mess or spill with these. They basically disintegrate in your hands as you’re trying to dry them. Spend the little bit extra for a paper towel that actually stays intact and drys your hands or mess. Would give 0 stars if I could.

This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! Feels like a sheet of copy paper, thin and you have to use about 5 to equal one normal paper towel. Horrible quality! Very disappointed

I generally buy bounty paper towels but bought these instead. I originally liked these until i recieved a sealed roll when i opened it up it had blood on it.  How it got i to a dealed package not sure but needless to say i threw the whole thing out gross. So i paid for something and couldnt use it sadly.

This is some real dollar general type product. See through thin, never tears right and every single one rips trying to get it off the roll. 100% waste of energy, paper, trees, and my time.  Buy bounty. $2 more and you’ll use half as much as you did here. I guess we’re back to Amazon making garbage for a quick buck.

Amazon tempted me with a discount on their new paper towel. It was cheap.  Once I started using it, the cheapness translates to a low quality, undurable, barely absorbent paper towel.Would not recommend unless it's free.

Literally the worst paper towels I’ve ever used. Not absorbent at all, feels more like tissue paper than a paper towel, immediately disintegrates, leaves paper flecks every where. Even for the price, I would never purchase these again.

Sams was out of stock on my usual paper towels so I bought these for a dollar MORE.  I THOUGHT when it came in such a small box it was something else. The rolls were no where near as big and there were less towels. I didn’t read the total description and got not even close.  DON’T DO IT

I do not like these at all. They are so thin I feel like I get better quality from the dollar store. I think they are hard to rip off the roll as well. I won’t be buying these again sadly. I usually really enjoy the quality of Amazon brand stuff but these were so rough and not soft at all

1 The inner roller is smaller than normal towels and it makes it hard to rotate on holders.2. The absorbency of the towel is not good.  They are very stiff and do not absorb well.3. They are not soft at all (contributing the ability to absorb).4. The sheets are smaller than other towels (normally purchased from Costco).

great and easy way to get your paper towels but not when you order 12 and receive 6. There is no way to get your money back other than returning the item. will not be repurchasing this item on amazon again.

Wanted to like these since they were available via subscription at a price that appeared to be only slightly more than Walmart. We tried them for a couple of months but ended up canceling our subscription and returning the last couple of orders when it became obvious that the poor quality was endemic to the brand and was not just a one-off. Although they absorb fine, the towel rolls are difficult to start without ripping a bunch of layers off. Also, they almost always rip at the bottom when tearing a sheet off a standard dowel-style vertical dispenser. We will be going back to the tried and true generic Walmart brand that we’ve been happy with for years.

I rarely write reviews and really had to for this one. I had high expectations for anything with Amazon basics to meet its qualities. This paper towel is soo dusty that I think it might be a bit harmful. I didn't realize until after a few rolls and thought it was from something else, but no. Very very sad experience.

I’ve used poor paper products before but this is another level of bad quality. Every time you grab a piece from the roll it sheds tiny pieces. It looks like snow all over the counter top and floor

These paper towels are very stiff and thin. I’ve written on paper thicker than these. You need more than one just to dry your hands after washing. I am really disappointed in the quality of these but I guess you get what you pay for. If you’re looking for a half decent paper towel, look elsewhere.

I found the paper towels to be lacking in absorbency and durability. The sheets were thin and tore quickly, making them less effective for cleaning up spills and messes. I needed a lot of paper towels to clean up a simple mess. I was disappointed with the overall quality and would not purchase this brand again.

These paper towels are horrible. I’ve had luck with some Amazon Basics products over the years but these are terrible. They cost the same as much better quality paper towels but are absolute garbage. Do not buy these unless you plan on going through one roll a day to double them up because they’re so thin.

I normally buy the paper towels from Sam's Club and these looked like they would be the same. I was hoping to not have to renew my Sam's Club membership by getting the items I normally buy in bulk from Amazon instead. All was okay at first. The first few sheets came off good and I thought I had made a great purchase. But after a few sheets in, the layers were not lined up. Any time I would try to tear a sheet off I would get 2 separate layers and fluff and powder from what was in between the layers would fly out and coat everything within a foot or so of the paper towels. Daily, I have to clean up the powder and fluff from my countertop, the top of my coffee maker and anything else that had the misfortune of sitting on my counter at the moment. I thought maybe it was just a bad roll but then I have had 4 more rolls, same thing. I am just using them up till they are gone because I don't want to waste them but I can't give these away because they are so bad. I am just disappointed I bought 2 packs.

I wouldn’t recommend buying these. They are extremely cheap feeling and very thin. They barely absorb anything and are not good for cleaning. They also start crumbling if you try to scrub anything with them.

These are useless to me as they do not fit on a standard paper towel holder. Paper is thinner than expected. These are not the quality expected from Amazon products.Would not buy again.

This paper towels are the absolute worst I've ever used they are not even the slightest absorbent they are reminiscent of the brown towels for drying hands on a roll in public bathrooms.  You can tell just by feeling them when you open them.  But then when I used them, completely doesn't absorb anything.  This is proof positive less expensive is not always better.  I can't even use them up they are that bad. Back to Bounty!

Unless you are wiping a drop of water off your counter top and still enjoy using 7 sheets then avoid and invest in a cloth wash cloth that can at least be reused.

Seriously these are horrible they don't absorb they don't rip on the line absolutely awful. I thought they'd be like Kroger store brand or something and that reviews were trying to compare to expensive brands but they are SO much worse than the worst store brand. Don't waste your money!

I use to Subscribe & Save to Presto! brand, those were amazing, but Amazon discontinued those and came out with these.Thin - They are so thin, the first time we got them I thought I accidentally ordered 1-ply. But nope, they are 2-ply.Small - Description says 2⅔ regular roll = 1 of their roll, and I'm not sure where that came from as it's also the smallest roll of paper towels I've ever seen.Absorbency - it's 50/50, it does a decent job, but it's so thin, you have to use morePerforation - I have not had the same issues with tearing at the perforation as other reviews haveOverall - I would not recommend, and I'm going to search for another brand.

It's a blah brand of paper towels like most other cheap ones out there you can buy.The absorbency isn't there...like when you wipe up something other than water something that has more substance to it just doesn't do the trick and it makes a bigger mess. It will absorb water well but due to being so thin it can't keep it absorbed and makes a bigger mess. And the strength isn't there either.I gave it 2 stars because if you don't expect anything from it other than very minimal use then it should be perfect to have around.

Won’t buy again. I thought I’d try these as I normally buy my paper towels out of a members only wholesale store. However, my wholesale store is 50 miles in one direction (100 miles round trip) and they were the only item I had run out of. I think my next trip to that store, I’ll buy double the quantity and chalk this up to a lesson learned. They are cheaply made, not as thick or as absorbent as I’d hoped that they would have been. I paid the same price for much better quality from the wholesale store.

First time buying these paper towels. We were on our last roll and I didn’t see time to go to the store in the next couple of days. What a waste of money on these thin, non-absorbent paper towels. You run through them 3x as fast as other brands because they’re horrible. I don’t even buy name brand usually, I usually grab the Target brand; and those blow these away. So I’m buying generic and these don’t even stand up to the generics.Everyone saying they’re great and amazing; has really low standards. I would never buy these again.

These are very thin and do not tear completely along the perforated line. I must have mangled two-thirds of the roll before the sheets tore more cleanly, but it isn't that much better than at the start of the roll. The Presto! towels are decently thick (i.e., can wipe up a greater amount of liquid and don't fall apart when wet), and each sheet tears cleanly, as far as I can tell. If you're debating between the two, buy the Presto! pack.

Quality is thin and scratchy it is two ply but the thinnest two ply you can imagine. Like two pieces of tissue paper ironed together. Perforation is hit or miss sometimes it tears cleanly other times it does not. Easily overwhelmed by liquid so you end up using more than necessary. Save yourself some aggravation an buy some Bounty or Brawny for a few cents more per roll.

I thought the cost of these were great compared to Sam’s club or Costco paper towels.  So I ordered them and man do they feel cheap! It almost feels like you’re cleaning a mess with tissue paper. I need to use 4 squares to clean anything up. So it doesn’t feel cheaper at all. Kirkland and members mark brand is the way to go!

They are way too thin and nearly useless in the kitchen.  You need to grab at least 3 sheets to clean anything up and they rip 2/3 of the way down the towel as you rip them off so you're left with oddball sizes and scraps.  Will not buy again.  Got up to 2 stars only for the price and ease of shopping

I usually buy my paper towels at Costco, but saw these for the same price and delivery was more convenient. These Amazon paper towels are so thin, don’t absorb a lot, and rip easily. For the same price, the Costco brand is thicker, more absorbent, and better quality overall. The quality of these is pretty much the same as paper towels from the dollar store.

You know the scratchy, super thin paper towels the drs offices have? That’s what these are except these are on a roll. If you’re in need of an absorbent paper towel, this is not it. Maybe for a kids birthday party or something of the sort where absorbency and durability aren’t needed. It’ll be best to spend the extra money on another brand.

Yes, these are very strong paper towels (only reason it's not a 1 star review), but you cannot get a clean tear between sheets because the perforations are absolutely garbage. Many of them don't even go more than halfway across leaving you with shredded tears, partial sheets, a sheet that tears off the next one halfway through, etc. I thought it might have just been the first roll and a bad batch because Amazon brand items are usually pretty good, but every roll we have done is like this. Never going to buy this product again.

These paper towels are probably my least favorite I have used. They don't rip even on the seams, and are barely absorbent. Yes they are cheap, but if you are getting Amazon brand, get the "Presto" ones instead. Feel very thin for being 2-ply. They still work, but I will not be getting these ones again.

These are purchased for an office I work in.  They get the job done when drying your hands, but you have to use a substantial amount to clean up a coffee spill.  They are pretty thin sheets.  Large retail store generic brands are of better quality for roughly the same price.

So I was trying to save a trip to Costco and thought I’d order these instead of the Costco paper towels as they were only a couple bucks more. When I saw how tiny the package was when it arrived, I realized it was a big mistake. They feel like the cheapest, hardest paper towels. Yes they are select a size, but the rolls are so tiny. I plan to store them in our shed and use them for oil spills or whatever outside. I’ve seen other generics feel like this so they are not worse than other cheap towels, but you get twice as much for your money IMO with the Costco pack. Those are soft, absorbent and much larger rolls. Will not purchase again.

I suppose it did say 2 ply so I'm not sure what I was expecting... but these are thin and not very absorbent at all. You have to use a lot more to clean up a small mess than you would with more durable towels. My household blew through a roll because it takes so many to do normal tasks and cleanups. Not horrible if you know what you're getting (thin and scratchy kinda like printer paper) but definitely won't be purchasing again.

I am used to being pleasantly surprised by the Amazon Basics brand. It is usually very similar to its name brand counterparrs.With these paper towels that is not the case. Both my wife and I on first pull said never again.It's almost as bad as that super cheap toilet paper that is transparent with the same feel and texture.Maybe when they up the ply, but in its current form I could not recommend this to anyone.

I expected these paper towels to be thin and not the greatest quality , which was true.  But what I did not expect is the paper towel roll to not fit on my paper towel dispenser. The cardboard roll inside of the paper towels is smaller than a normal paper towel roll

I rated these Good Quality but they really are not. They do the job but are hard to pull off the roll and are scratchy. I will stick with my Amazon paper towels once these are gone. We really are not picky but these just did not appeal to us.

Highly disappointed in the quality of the new Amazon brand paper towels  ☹️ these were my favorite, always had them stocked on subscribe and save. This new package I got … stinks! They barely wipe up anything. Sad I’ll have to find a new brand

So I have had these on a subscription for quite some time.  Its nice to not have to remember to get them.  At up until my last order of these NO COMPLAINTS.  I am on the last pack from my last order placed (I get multiple packs at once every few months).  These are horrible, rough, super thin, the rolls even feel smaller. Honestly it reminds me of during peak covid when we needed to get paper towels from dollar tree.  I don't know if this is a quality control thing, we even compared packages because we thought maybe these are one ply or something and nope same packages as always.  I'll finish these last few rolls but they will be used as a back up to name brand to be used outside, in the shed, in the trunk of the car etc.

They are the same size and quality of any off brand paper towel you see in a grocery store. I didn't expect them to be top tier in quality or absorption, but I feel lied to when it comes to their size. All and all not very cost effective. Could've spent $2 more at the store and would have got something that lasted much much longer

Too thin and runs out fast. I trusted it being Amazon basics and basic it is. For just a couple more dollars I could have got a thicker better quality roll. In the end you'll be spending more money going this route.

These paper towels are awful, listen to the negative reviews. My guess is that Amazon started with one supplier and then switched for price because all the negative comments are spot on! These do not tear so get ready to have a half or a quarter of sheet when you try to separate them. They are super thin and sandpapery so be prepared for very little absorbency and an exterior that would never allow you to blow your nose in it for how harsh they are. These are all in all the worst paper towels I've ever bought which is why I bothered.

These paper towels are super thin. If you don’t care about quality, then these paper towels may be right for you. The best perk is that it’s delivered. You can get better quality at your local bulk store for the same price.

If you use Bounty or any other durable brand, these will be a downgrade. I use paper towels a lot. I know these are cheaper; however, they are so thin which means - you’ll end up folding two pieces into one and then it comes out twice the price. Idk if they do it as a strategy or they truly believe their product works. At the end of the day, it’s a paper towel and it works, but it’s annoying to try to rip off one piece and half a piece and a quarter comes off because they are so thin

I thought that it would be ok in lieu of the regular brand that they were out of. These are horrible. They’re thin, of cheap quality and don’t absorb as they should. I’m very disappointed that I got these.

I really wanted to like these especially for the price point. However they are not at absorbent so I need to use more towels then usual. Ends up not being cost effective. They do tear well at the sheets.

Super good price absolutely, 2 ply absolutely not. It is very thin.I took a picture to show you that you can see my hand through it. That would suggest it's entirely too thin and not 2 ply

I am a little bit of a papaer towel expert lol.  These work but are very rough. The best paper towel out there is Kirkland Signature (Costco) they are sopfter, thicker, bigger rolls and better priced per sheet.

Incredibly thin paper towels, I don’t actually think I’ve seen anything like it lol. They’re more akin to printer paper and don’t do a great job at cleaning up liquid messes (I.e., you need many more sheets than usual)

I’ve used these which always rip when you go to year a sheet and don’t absorb a lot, these and target brand leaves residue…. bjs the ones in the green bag is win!!! Budget friendly, bounty too expensive!

Gave these a try because they’re cheaper than the Costco brand paper towels I normally buy. The rolls are smaller than my regular ones and much less absorbant. One roll lasted about half as long as my usual ones. They worked, but just not well. I think the size and durability drawbacks negate any immediate cost sayings you get with these.

I only ordered this brand because my regular recurring paper towel order was out of stock. Well, never again. It's so thin that a little water will cause it to tear and kindda crumble. Poor quality.

Paper towels don't need a super thick cardboard box glued with CEMENT - totally impossible to open and flatten.  I will never order these again even tho the paper towels are probably fine. Ridiculous and wasteful.

+ ships right to my door+ gets the job done- very thin and cheap feeling- does not absorb as much as similarly priced competitorsSo I would not get these again unless I really didn’t want to go to local big box store close competitor. These rolls feel and look like Dollar Tree repackaged rolls. They are very cheap and rough feeling. Take it from me you get more value for your money getting the big containers at the local big box wholesale place.

These are very thin and don’t  absorb well. I frequently, use wet paper towels to wipe down counters, dust and do windows - these fall apart quickly when wet and rubbed onto surfaces. These are the same price as Sam’s club’s store brand but nowhere near the quality (which is more comparable to Bounty). I purchased them because I needed paper towels and had to spend a few dollars more on an order to get overnight shipping.  I doubt I’ll  be buying them again.

Are these not the same as the Presto brand which I thought were the Amazon brand?  If so, they have changed for the worst.  They aren't good at all.  Poor quality

Extremely poor quality paper towels. They came packed inside a heavy duty carton sealed with industrial glue that required a ton of muscle, patience, and various tools to open. A regrettable purchase.

They’d be ok if they were priced a buck a roll.These are like the paper towel version of those large industrial rolls of toilet paper that is so thin you can see you hand through it, and you need to use many layers to actually do the job.So in the end, it’s not cheaper, and they are a pain to use. They practically fall apart when wet.2 stars because they could actually be worse, but not by much.

My wife has told me she will divorce me if I buy these paper towels again. She is a bit picky about things like paper towels. She's not completely out of line. They're thin, they're not very absorbent, and they don't tear cleanly from the rest of the roll. I don't know why that last one bothers me as much as it does, but it does. They are cheap, so if that's your leading concern, you may be fine with them.

I am disappointed in the quality of these paper towels. They are thinner than the Presto paper towels I normally buy. The biggest problem is that they never storage cleanly from the roll. Rather than a clean tear along the cut line; without fail they rip at an odd angle, leaving you with a triangle shaped piece of paper towel rather than the rectangle you expected. I’m going back to Presto paper towels. I would not recommend Amazon Brand.

Towels are so thin the "flex" option is useless, as you need multiple towels to simply dry your hands. It's also so thin it won't easily tear along the perforation.

Compared to Bounty these paper towels don’t absorb or hold as much water. One select a size or half towel of Bounty dries my face, hands and sink rim. To do the same I need three select a size or one and half towels of Amazon brand.

They are cheap and the quality reflects it. Rarely can I tear off a sheet without it ripping in to the next one.  Not soft, not very absorbent.

These are the most basic paper towels, they are like the cheap store brand and NOT like Bounty.  Can use them for note paper in the kitchen.

First time ordered. Seemed low quality from the beginning. But the end was glued down through several layers, and the two plies separated as I tried to start separate the first sheets from the glue. I ended up losing 2-3 full-sized sheets trying to get the two plies to align and tear off as normal. I've never had this issue with paper towels before. Factor that in as you evaluate this poor-quality product. I won't be buying these again.

If you want paper towels that tear off, don't buy these.  This is more like one continuous roll.  Thats right, one really long paper towel.

I normally buy Costco's store brand:  Kirkland.  I was not planning a Costco trip so tried these.  Big mistake.  Nowhere near the Kirkland quality.  Not has heavy weight, not as absorbing, and do not tear apart properly.

These are a step above those old brown paper towels from back in grade school that practically repelled water. These do the job of a paper towel but better off buying quality versus one sheet that can barely handle a small puddle.

For 22$, I got cheap paper towels that don’t absorb much of anything. They’re like sheets of writing paper, no softness to it. Weird.

It says 2-ply but these are so thin I find I have to use more.  Not worth the price charged for them.I'll go back to paying a couple of dollars more for a different brand.

We have a lot of cats, so we have many messes to clean up.  Some big, some small.  These are alright for smaller messes.  You cannot scrub with them, or they fall apart.  We normally use Brawny, and I was trying to save some money, but in our case, I don't think we're saving anything.  Sparkle paper towels are about the cheapest ones we've found that are somewhat acceptable.  I don't think we'll buy these again, but if your messes aren't really bad, they might do okay for you.

Not as thick, as big, or as absorbing as Costco brand / other name brands but they do work! They do not last as long as other name brands cause I use more when cleaning or drying things off. They are soft and eco-friendly.

I recently purchased these paper towels from Amazon, and I have been quite satisfied with their performance. Allow me to share my experience and thoughts on this product.To begin with, these paper towels are competitively priced, but I do believe there is room for improvement in terms of being even more competitively priced. However, despite this minor consideration, the convenience of ordering these paper towels and having them delivered right to my door cannot be overstated. It saves time and eliminates the need to make an extra trip to the store.In terms of functionality, these paper towels perform admirably. They possess a similar absorbency to major name brands, allowing them to handle spills and messes effectively. Whether it's wiping up liquids or tackling household cleaning tasks, these paper towels do the job well.One aspect that stood out to me is the tear-away feature. The perforations on the rolls are well-designed, allowing for easy and clean tearing of individual sheets. This feature ensures that you can tear off the desired amount of paper towel without any hassle or waste.The packaging of these paper towels is also noteworthy. The sturdy cardboard box provides excellent protection during transit and storage. Additionally, the individual wrapping of each roll adds an extra layer of convenience and keeps the paper towels clean and intact. This feature makes them particularly suitable for storage solutions, such as in the garage or other areas where cleanliness and organization are important.Considering the price and the convenience they offer, these paper towels provide excellent value for the money. While there may be opportunities for further price optimization, the overall quality and convenience of the product make it a worthwhile purchase.In conclusion, these paper towels are a reliable and convenient choice for everyday use. Despite the potential for improved pricing, the ease of ordering and home delivery cannot be overstated. They perform comparably to major name brands, and the tear-away feature ensures efficient usage. The sturdy packaging and individual wrapping contribute to an organized storage solution.If you're looking for a paper towel option that offers a balance of performance, convenience, and affordability, these paper towels are definitely worth considering. They provide a nice product for the money, making everyday cleaning tasks a breeze.

I like to low price.  However, the sheets were too thin so I needed to use more of it.Since I am having to use more, I don't know if I am saving money.

These paper towels are just okay but if you have been spoiled in the past by using paper towels that feel soft or not like paper these paper towels will disappoint you. These paper towels feel like paper and are not as good as Walmart double ply and not as soft either. I will not buy again and can’t wait to get rid of what I have!

I bought these paper towels because Amazon was out of the Presto brand that I normally buy. There is a $5 differences in price, but the difference in quality is tremendous. I wouldn’t pay $12 for these paper towels. I expected them to be slightly lower quality, but these are much worse. They are much closer to paper than they are towels. When you touch them, they crunch. If you are sensitive to sensory input at all, avoid these at all costs.

The quality of these paper towels is surprisingly pitiful. They are extremely thin and do not absorb liquids well. They often tear horizontally on a diagonal rather than down the dotted line. I buy Amazon Basics regularly, but I would never buy these again. I'm surprised that Amazon has chosen this product as their representative paper towel.

I bought these as a trial replacement for Bounty so I'd stop going to Costco and spending a fortune when all I needed were paper towels.  What I do love about these paper towels is that instead of one large sheet, they are divided into smaller sheets so you use less. However, that only works if the paper towel is of good quality and you don't need to grab 2 to do the job that 1 higher quality paper towel would do. These are not high quality. They are thin, only absorbent, as I said, if you grab like 2-4. As a low cost paper towel substitute I suppose they are fine, but if you're used to a high quality paper towel like Bounty, it's likely you're going to be disappointed.  I doubt I'll be buying them again. If I end up using 3-4, the value doesn't make much sense.

They work okay.  I would not purchase again, they are too thin.  I was hopeful they would be a dupe for bounty but no.

The Amazon Basics 2-Ply Flex-Sheets Paper Towels offer a decent deal with their affordable price, especially with the large pack size. However, the quality of the paper is a bit disappointing. The towels are thinner than I expected, so I often need to use more sheets to get the job done, which somewhat offsets the value. If you're looking for an economical option and don't mind the thinner material, these might work for you, but if durability is a priority, you might want to consider other options.

This paper towel does not tear easily at the perforations.  It is hard to get off the roll and wastes a lot of paper.

These are not a replacement for Bounty!!! They feel worse that the paper towels in the shop at work!! If you want a towel like paper towel - these aren't what your looking for.But a great price...

The towels I got, which don't seem to be two ply, won't take up much water.  Three half-towels will dry two hands.

If you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to Bounty brand paper towels, keep looking. While they are OK at wiping greasy fingers, don’t expect much more.  Not very durable and hold next to no liquid.

Go to take them out the glue  or the heat the use to melt the plastic actually melted to the paper towels

Cheap and low quality. I much prefer Kirkland brand paper towels because they are thicker and stronger. Will not buy this product again.

I usually use Bounty pick-a-size and decided to give Amazon's plain wrap brand a try to save money. What a mistake that was. Calling these "towels" of any kind is a stretch. These are so wafer thin when you go to tear one off most times the sheet rips and doesn't tear correctly along the seams because there is no strength to the wafter thin paper masquerading as a "paper towel". Barely absorbent except for the fact that it's made of paper. When I sweep the floor, I generally pick up the dust and debris by taking 2 sheets of Bounty towels (which in the pick-a-size gives you a big square of paper towel) and wetting them and then using them to pick up the debris and wipe the floor clean. With this cheap-o brand even 4 towels isn't enough. I used maybe 6 sheets to do the job that 2 sheets of Bounty could easily do. It's not saving money to get these. Use the better brands for better quality. In this case you really do get what you pay for. Dissapointed.Update: I may have been too harsh in my initial assessment. These are still very VERY thin but they do have some uses... as napkins for instance. I do end up using more of them vs other brands like Bounty but they aren't totally terrible.

Like a cheap budget product. Low absorption and falls apart. Need a lot of it to do any job.

These paper towels are not really very useful. The tiniest bit of moisture practically makes them disintegrate. Won’t buy again.

Maybe I am a paper snob, I don’t know. These are very thin, clump up when wiping up a small spill and shred apart at the same time. They are rough to the touch.  They just are not for me.They would be good on bathroom instead of a hand towel.

The papertowel rolls were a little smaller than I thought they would be for the price.

The title says it. You get what you pay for. They are very thin and hard to get started.

These are super thin but they work and you get a decent amount for the price.

They were ok but not as good as Bounty. But they are cheaper.

Usually purchase Costco paper towels. Gave these a try to see if the convenience of Amazon delivery would make me switch. Unfortunately not. Will see if Amazon offers a heavier paper towel and give that a try. Thin and not very absorbent.

They do the job if you need something very cheap. Unfortunately you do get what you pay for. These are thin and scratchy and not particularly absorbent compared to some name brands. If you're just cleaning up messes, they're probably alright.

Bought these in a pinch. Decent. Rolls not super full. They definitely wipe stuff up so that’s good.But issue I’m getting yelled at for by my wife, is that they “leave lint”. Trying to clean shower doors and lint everywhere. I had to sacrifice one of my tshirts to wipe lint off :(

Thin and not worth the savings per our company

These paper towels are very lightweight and thin and do not absorb much of anything at all. You will be using twice as many to get the job done so just spend a couple more dollars.

Price point is great but the product itself isn't. The roll fits very tight on the holder so when you're trying to tear a paper towel, it rips in spots it shouldn't. Seriously makes you frustrated to use them.

We have had a few orders of these and they were great before. This latest package in August 2024 is not as good. They do not tear easily and I often get more sheets when trying to tear off just one. It's wasteful. I don't know what changed but these were better before.

A bit more expensive and inferior to Great Value. Better than Scott Towels or Sparkle. Obviously not as good as Bounty but much better price.Passable, but Great Value is the gold standard for quality/ price.

These paper towels are thin and I feel like you have to use twice as many to clean up a spill. They are cheaper than other brands, but you get what you pay for.

We usually grab Kirkland paper towels, but decided to give these a try.  Will definitely go back to Costco and grab Kirkland.  These paper towels are not very thick and do not pull apart well.  I can not wait to be through with what we bought.

Shake your hands off first because these thin towels don't hold much water.While they feel like they will dissolve while drying your hands, they've held up ok for light cleaning around the kitchen.

These towels are too thin! You need to use two or three to dry your hands, which defeats the cost savings I thought I was receiving. I will not purchase this product again.

You can read a newspaper through the towel I was expecting the quality of a club towel like Sam’s or Costco. Since it is priced in that league.  Underperforming at best

these are so thin they barely will pick up anything you have to use 4 times the amount of any other name brand paper towels to clean up a mess

not any better value than store

I decided to try these even though i usually order from Costco. The quality just did not compare. I also have been so annoyed because a little piece tears off every time I try to pull a towel off. I dont care for the quailty

I ordered these paper towels to prevent going to a big box store. They are fine, but thin when compared to paper towels that I would normally buy.

Very thin, will not repurchase

and the cheap grocery store brands

A little too thin. One towel would get soaking wet while drying your hands. You need to use to to really dry your hands .

They sell higher quality paper towels at Dollar Tree. 2 ply but the plys come apart when trying to rip a sheet off the roll. Almost as thin as toilet paper. Spend the extra money and get something that actually works

From time to time you can always find some unknown brown scraps left on the dishes after using the towels to dry them after washing.

I have purchase two did different brands from Amazon & find the Presto a much better thicker universal paper towel for the money.

These are the kind of paper towels that you would find in a government office. They are not very thick or absorbent.

Disappointed in quality of paper towels ,  thin, feels cheap, does not feel like qualityWill not order again

These paper towels and the lowest quality - They’re so thin you have to use 10 to just equal 1 regular paper towel sheet that actually absorbs anything. Ripoff, do not buy!

I recently decided to try Amazon’s own brand of paper towels, attracted by their affordable price. After using them for a few weeks, I can say that they’re a solid option for those on a budget, though they do have a few drawbacks compared to major brands.  One of the biggest advantages of Amazon Paper Towels is their cost. They’re significantly cheaper than the leading brands, making them an attractive option for families or anyone looking to save on household essentials. You get a decent amount of paper towels for the price, which stretches your budget further. For everyday tasks like wiping up small spills or cleaning countertops, they get the job done without breaking the bank.  The absorbency of these paper towels is decent, though not exceptional. They do a good job with light to moderate messes, absorbing liquids fairly well. However, they can struggle with bigger spills or thicker liquids, where you might need to use a few more sheets than you would with a premium brand.  Where Amazon Paper Towels fall short is in strength. Compared to major brands like Bounty or Viva, these towels are noticeably thinner and less durable. They can tear more easily, especially when wet, so they’re not ideal for tougher cleaning tasks or scrubbing. For quick, light cleanups, they work fine, but if you’re dealing with a big mess or something sticky, you might find yourself reaching for more sheets than usual.  Despite their weaker performance in strength, the value you get from Amazon Paper Towels is still impressive. If you’re looking for a cost-effective solution for basic cleaning tasks around the house, they’re a reasonable choice. Just be prepared to use a bit more to get the same results you’d expect from higher-end brands.  Amazon Paper Towels offer good value for the price, especially for those who don’t want to spend a lot on paper products. While they’re not as strong or durable as major brands, they’re perfectly adequate for everyday use. If you’re willing to trade a bit of strength for a lower price, these paper towels are worth considering.

These paper towels are a game-changer! Super absorbent and durable, they handle spills and messes with ease. Whether it’s cleaning the kitchen or wiping up after kids, they get the job done without falling apart. I love that they’re soft but strong, so you don’t have to use a ton to clean up. Definitely a household essential! GREAT PRICE

Just imagine you don't have to carry this package around when you go shopping!Good quality paper. Great price.

It does the job. You can cut this in half (easy to tear) so you maximize it use. It can also be used a cleaner and wipes the dirt off and absorbs the liquids.

These are a very good value, but they aren't super high quality or my preferred style of paper towel.They're very thin, I like to describe them as "crunchy and crinkly", comparable to brands like Sparkle or Walmart's Great Value "Everyday Strong" variety.They work, but they're not very soft or absorbent like Member's Mark or Up&Up.The packaging is inconsistent but Amazon made it right mostly. I selected to ship in Amazon packaging to hide what's inside because I needed it to be kept clean with a barrier, but it was delivered in the product box and not taped shut. Support issued a replacement and said it would ship in an outer box, but it didn't. It was taped shut so all gaps were covered this time though. So know it's a gamble if packaging matters to you for theft prevention or cleanliness.

The only reason I didn’t give these paper towels a 5 is because the hole was a bit of a tight fit on my holder.  Otherwise, these are very good quality towels, meaning not flimsy or rough.  If not for the hole issue, I would buy them again and again.

I recently bought the Amazon Basics 2-Ply Flex-Sheets Paper Towels, and overall, I’m quite pleased with them. The price is very budget-friendly for the quantity you get—12 rolls equating to 32 regular rolls is an excellent value. Each roll has 150 sheets, which provides plenty of paper towels for everyday use.The quality is solid, and they do a good job for most cleaning tasks. They’re absorbent enough for general spills and messes. However, I did find that the paper towels are a bit thinner than I expected. While this doesn’t significantly impact their performance, it’s worth noting if you’re looking for something more robust.For the price and the number of rolls you get, these paper towels are a great buy. They offer good quality for the value and are perfect for regular household needs. Just be aware that they might be slightly thinner than some other brands if that’s an important factor for you.

Good quality paper towels for a great price. These paper towels definitely get the job done, however they are not very soft. I love the fact that you get so many good sized rolls for such a good price.

The individual sheets are hard to rip off (compared to name brands).  Use both hands or the whole roll will unravel

Strong, absorbent, and a great value!

They  are very absorbent but there's something to be said about the texture and softness. They are okay!

Good product

Like to large roll. Also half size sheets.

There seems to be a weird filmy consistency with these. They work fine and pretty great but there is a dusty feel to them.

This is a quality paper towel for a reasonable price.  It will not be my everyday go to towel, but for most things it will work perfect.  I say give it a try.

I’m not a bouji buyer here I’m all about the cheapest option of everything. These are literally like a peice of paper😂 still getting a 4 star because they work. Texture = paper

They're not as thick or absorbent as, say, Bounty, but they're perfectly serviceable and solid value for the price.

These are useful, inexpensive paper towels. They hold up pretty well and soak up a good bit of water even while not being very thick. They are not very soft, but they are softer than some of the competing inexpensive versions. They were certainly soft enough for regular cleaning use. They are an average size, and not much to say on that point. You can't really tell they're made from recycled content, so they remain very functional paper towels that you could use for a variety of purposes while still helping the environment.

Great value for the money. Not as flimsy and stiff as most generic brands, but similar in style. I think we've found our new go-to.

Better than most.

It does its job! Its not any thing I would say was fancy or think or soft..it just a paper towel! price was good!

I like softer a little bit to hard

It’s good for light cleaning. Picking the size you need is nice. It would be great if it was a little thicker and stronger.

I recently gave the Amazon Basics 2-Ply Paper Towels a shot, and I must say, they've become an essential part of my household routine. With an overall rating of 4/5 stars, these paper towels offer excellent value for the price.What immediately stands out is the unbeatable cost. It's hard to find a comparable product at such a budget-friendly price point. While there are paper towels on the market with superior absorption capabilities, they often come with a hefty price tag and a flashy brand name. The Amazon Basics alternative, however, delivers reliable performance without breaking the bank.In my kitchen, where small messes seem to be a constant occurrence thanks to the presence of small kids and an artist in the family, these paper towels have seamlessly integrated into our cleaning arsenal. They may not have the top-tier absorbency of some pricier options, but for everyday spills and cleanups, they get the job done efficiently.One of the key selling points is the option to subscribe, providing even more savings. With the convenience of regular deliveries, we never run out of paper towels, and the subscription discount sweetens the deal.While they may not be the absolute best on the market in terms of absorbency, the Amazon Basics 2-Ply Paper Towels strike an excellent balance between performance and affordability. For everyday use and constant cleanups, this product is a solid choice that won't leave your wallet feeling light. I highly recommend giving them a try, especially if you're looking for an economical solution without compromising on quality.

I prefer Quilted  Northern now, but used Amazon Basics until the price increased substantially.

We live more than an hour from our Costco store. So, we can't make it there very often. What we pay for Costco paper towels is a good fair price and the quality is outstanding. I think we'll order this paper towel from Amazon as a backup. If the quality of this towel and the price were comparable with the Costco, we'd switch in a minute to make this our number one choice. Meanwhile, it is what it is.

They aren't my favorite. They aren't as soft as others I've purchased, but they did a good job and were worth it for the price.

Great product for the price.solid performance and durability.  Very easy to use as well.

For the value, I would recommend these to anyone. The definitely have the "feel" of any bargain store brand. They are thin and rough-er to the touch, but they get the job done. Sometimes you may need to use more than you would normally use, but overall I wouldn't hesitate to order again

Not the best but for the price it’s worth it

They are absorbent and serve the purpose.

Could be more absorbent. I find I have to use more paper than with my regular brand. I wanted to give it a try. This is my 2nd order. Will probably go back to my regular brand,

Decent quality for the price. I’m normally a name brand purchaser and decided to try this out. Not bad for off brand. It’s actually soft and durable. Two ply makes it acceptable for off brand.

These are durable and hefty. They COULD be a litter bit softer but honestly all that matters is that they’re good at absorbing!

I did watch all of the reviews for this product. I think I expected a little more they’re not very strong. Not sure it’s a great value for the money.

I bought a few packages of these along with the Presto ones while there was some promotion.  We are not paper towel loyalist household and will use whatever is usually the best deal.  With that said, these were a fairly good deal, but do have caveats.  They are thinner, thus less strong and doesn't absorb as much as more premium brands.  I would equate these to slightly better than brands like Sparkle.  The Presto ones are a little thicker, so a good midweight towel.  All said, for the price, these are a decent value just don't expect to use them to last like a towel when scrubbing or wiping up large spills.

Good for price but not the best paper towels

These paper towels are only one ply, but that’s fine for light tasks. Great for little spills, lunch napkins, cleaning a slightly dirty counter, shining up a mirror, etc.  Why use two-ply when one will do?

Not all the rolls were perforated . Had to tear off what was needed. Unevenly and wasteful.

Single ply. Could be softer. But better than other cheap versions.

Works like they’re supposed to do. You get what you get for the price you pay. Not a cheap feeling paper towel but not a high end kind either

Really nice paper towels. But, the sections don't pull away to separate and tear clean.Be

General household use

Not great

I just needed these for something quick. They are good just a little thin

These paper towels are very durable. I cam get it wet to wipe down counter and it stays intact.

For the price, these paper towels are quite good.  While not nearly as good as alternatives such as Bounty, Brawny, etc., they still get the job done.While they are good for the price, it is worth noting that you will likely need 2 sheets to get the same effectiveness as 1 sheet of better brands such as Bounty.  This has not been an issue for me, as I mainly use it for spot cleaning and small spills.  I would advise against purchasing this brand if you have a house prone to big messes.  You would likely save more money in the long run going for another brand in that case.

Good deal. Not the worst purchase ever. Good quality. Shopped fast. Not the greatest but works more than well enough.  Thought it would be too thin but seems ok.

These are great for everything. They’re like double cut so you get 3 small cuts compared to one large towel. It’s not too fancy that you’re gonna feel guilty for using it and it’s perfect for u to use In larger quantities too. Like I using one small piece for when we eat a snack or a slice of pizza and when I make hash browns from scratch they’re perfect to dry out a large amount of shredded potatoes.

This is a great basic to have on auto-delivery and it's at a great pricepoint. These are the only paper towels we buy now!

A good bargain for someone like me who only really uses paper towels to drain things like bacon -- but who has housemates who go through it at a frightening rate but don't buy it.

Love ordering cases instead of just a few at a time. Makes a big difference!

The towel works well for. Cleaning all  round the house  the garage and backyard the assortment is strong ..they last along time

I have these delivered every 2 weeks. They are great paper towels. They are durable and strong.

Good for light house work. Will buy again.

Love these. Not a lot of lint

Good buy . Same as name brand

Amazon Basics products are wonderful. They work as expected and are better than other brands. These paper towels allow you to pick the size you need. I think they are of a good strength and I highly recommend them.

The towels serve the usual purpose but I find the sheets to be quite thin and I need to use more sheets for the job of wiping up.

Great quality and Great price

Don't like they don't absorb as well as the presto brand, I'm switching back.

We use these all the time. With the cost of everything increasing; it’s a great comparison to name brand.

Since Biden/Harris 4yrs inflation and now recession groceries are gouging and gouging! We are a busy family. Papertowels are essential in our home. But grocery stores are killing us as the government no give a crap so at least these are affordable and good product to replace grocery store inflated crap!

Great quality for the value

This product comes in plastic wrap and is separated into smaller plastic packs which makes easy for placing upstairs in my house.  The paper towels are a good value for your money, I have these on subscribe and save every other month.  It is just my husband and I in the house and these are plenty enough!

Our family uses these paper towels all the time.  Great value, quality.  Highly recommend.

Good strong hold

Good for the price

My wife loves this deal

These are a good preview for what you get and no they aren’t the fancy paper towels with the extra layers but it gets the job done and this is a better option if you go threw a lot

good deal for the cost

Great Price and Great Quality

Great product

I like Amazon paper towels. It saves me money.

Best value for the money!

Can’t go wrong with this basic product. Works the same as the big brands for much less!

Nice, works as it should

Good price

No complaints

Glad to have these around.

These paper towels work well and a good value for the money.

Very durable. I have used this for 2 years an d recommend it.

I like that it is strong and doesn't fall apart when being used. A little goes a long way. I do prefer a softer fluffer paper. But for the price this will be in my top 5 choices. Always an option when price is an issue.

I buy these durable paper towels every month! They are perfect size and bang for my buck! I use them late my daycare center and we use them and buy more! Even my kiddos use them!!

I thought I'd try these so I bought 3 rolls.  I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy they are!  I was expecting a lot less absorbency.  It works just as well as the expensive name brand ones do in my opinion.  I'll definitely be buying more.

I order these paper towels every time we’re out! Always arrives quickly and absorbent enough to cut an apple on one sheet! Will keep reordering as they are cheaper than your local store

Superfast delivery. Great Product. Will definitely order again.

Great product but only competitive when I buy during prime days

It’s a normal roll, decently absorbent, and comes with enough to last at least a couple weeks. Great if you’re planning ahead and want a bunch of them. You’ll need a decent amount of space to store it all though

We love amazon brand paper towels over anything else. I get mad when i run out and have to go to the store and buy another brand. They work great!

I think they are good. They are cheap, they do what they are supposed to do. I have the reusable ones so I just use these for like when I fry fries, etc.

Good quality, texture and economically friendly

The Viva towels that I normally receive are a very soft paper towel like a cloth. Not like what I have received recently it’s more like a very, very stiff paper towel like bounty or something I like the other softer version much better.

THIS USED TO BE SUCH AS WONDERFUL PRODUCT.....Our watercolor teacher recommended using Viva in class and raved about how great it was with paint. She recommended letting a used sheet air dry and use it as inspiration for our paintings,. She was right . I recently  used up my last roll of Viva and purchased these from Amazon. They are terrible ! Viva used to be cloth-like, soft and long-lasting. These (and the "Signature") have gone down hill. I am so disappointed. It used to be such a good product that cost more but worth it. RIP !

For years I bought Viva paper towels for their cloth-like soft hand.These are not that.The name is the same, the description the same, but these towels are rough and amongst the most unpleasant to touch I think I’ve ever handled. As for absorbtion, it’s almost non-existent.

This is essentially store-brand Brauny, but with even smaller rolls. I went through all 12 rolls in under a month. Don't waste your money.

These “paper towels” feel exactly like Cottonelle toilet paper. While I love Cottonelle for toilet paper, I would never want my paper towels to be this soft (?) and non absorbent. idk how else to describe it, but it sucks. 0/10

Price can be beat

They make papertowels with good price then charge like over 20$ for shipping.dont fall for the trick

This is not the cloth viva I have purchased in the past . This  is very deceiving as packages look exactly the same .The paper towels are completely different one is like most other much cheaper paper. The one I used to buy is soft like tissue and strong which is why I pay more for it .I see now slight difference on package but it is VERY misleading.

Paper towels are hard as a rock.I will not buy again.

These are not super rolls they are regular sized paper towel rolls.

For medical & health reasons we use TONS of paper towels.We where hoping to save a little and try these from Viva.ZERO STARS pathetic paper towels.These are thin, roll is small, not select a size and similar to a Dollar store brand.These are NOT the Viva I have come to know and love.WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN!

I don't want the "new" Viva I want the original Viva the soft you can use for anything Viva! This Stuff is like all the rest of the hard towels. Where's your original Viva????

Never again will i buy! Stick with my other named brand

The Viva soft towels that I just opened on my order is not like the ones I have been using.  I have been using Viva soft towels for years and these that I got are not the soft viva towels I’ve been buying.  These are like a hard material ( like all the other paper towels out on the market ) that they are made from not soft.  These viva towels are hard and not a soft towel feeling!  Have you changed the way you are making Viva soft paper towels?  I’am very Disappointed in theses Viva towels

Long strip unravels on each roll on left side the whole length. So annoying. Cheap feeling also.

Didn’t like the feel

I where cloth and it isn't even close to these. That's strike 2. I don't like half size paper towels, my hand is bigger then the towel. That was strike one, but willing to try and see if they are even close to other towels at window cleaning. Find good Bountey way better imho.

These are not Viva, I wonder if you need to look for the "signature cloth" sign, these feel like regular paper towels. I have been using Viva for year and feel disappointed I am stuck with this pack.

Must have been seconds and got by quality control. All my towels ended up being one ply and would not soak up anything very useless. Was on the the monthly order and save, but cancelled because of this being the outcome of my entire second case of towels. I was very disappointed and really would like my money back on these or a replacement case. They were useless. Rolled off all kinds of different ways, definitely a seconds product, and was not efficient.

I wish I had read the other reviews!I was looking for the thick, strong, soft, absorbent, heavy, cloth-like Viva towel. The kind that could be used as a handkerchief. The kind that could be used to wash a car. The kind that will literally stretch over an inch before it will rip. Well... this is NOT it!Rather, this item is a crispy, loosely-rolled, weak, value-brand paper towel that shouldn't cost more than a dollar per roll.Do not waste your money!

Don’t waste your money. This is a terrible product. Very little value for your money. Do not know what Viva was thinking when they put this product out.

Not the original Viva, more like pho viva, meaning fake. Lol ugh. Not soft and strong.

This was a mistake.  These ARE NOT the cloth like quality Viva that I buy at local stores.  Worse than Sparkle brand.  When these or used, or given away, no future purchase of this product for me.

Suppose to be cloth like paper towels. It is not. This is the second time this is happen. I want credit. This is fraud.

These are just cheap paper towels.  They are not double rolls, more like 6 rolls = 3 regular rolls (81 sheets per roll). The package says multi surface cloth. . I have used cloth paper towels, these are not cloth paper towels. Don't pay a premium for these or you will feel just as ripped off as I did.

These are not the thick soft cloth like Viva paper towels I only buy. They are thinner, guilted looking and hard as hell. The company needs to put a description on the package if the title is going to mean the quality ch as changes. Will have to purchase in person from now on from Walmart!They have the nerve to call these multi task. Well they won't be used to remove make up off my face as the original ones were, ali g with various other uses. I'd probably stand a better chance using sand paper!

These are FAKE Viva paper towels. NOT what you think you’re buying, so just don’t waste your money. These are thin, frail, crispy, and cheap.

Definitely not the same as regular viva. Very disappointed in the product. It's like using sand paper and hardly sucks up anything. Never again!!!

This tissue texture is hard !  didn't like !

These are not the fabric quality I like when buying them at Walmart. These feel more like bounce brand

I was used to vivas cloth style which was the very best for softness, absorbency, and lasting...this style is super ruff and does not hold up or absorb much.  the cheapest store brand is about the same as this. going back to the old viva cloth even though it's way overpriced, but it lasts forever and is very soft and absorbent

I’m a fine arts painter and have used the original Viva paper towel along with mineral spirits to get the oil paint off my brushes.  Those towels worked well.However, this stuff is junk. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY! It’s worse than the off off off off brand gathering dust on a back of the neighborhood discount store, lost somewhere between the single can of car oil and the dust laden candy bar display.These towels are even wrapped around the tube loosely to make the roll look bigger.  Viva should advertise these as “crêpe paper towels”.

These are not the snooty cloth-like papertowels, even though the description says cloth. Will never but again. Not soft at all. Just like a regular no-brand name papertowel

Its absolutely no where near the quality of Viva Paper Towel im used to. More of a dollar store brand paper towel. $19.99 is absolutely over priced.

I purchased quite a few of these a couple of years ago because they were great for cleaning eye glasses and almost like a cloth rag because they did not fall apart when they were wet. These new ones suck compared to the old ones. They are nothing like the ones of old. They are the same type of junk the other brands sell but these are more expensive. I am thankful I did not order any more of these than I did. I won't buy them again.

Not like the viva towels I normally use. These are very rough.

Never will I buy this again too little on the rolls.😭😭😭😭😭

I ordered and expected the cloth like paper towels that Viva makes, that is not what I received, I got the paper like textured one I was very disappointed. I won’t order this again, because I would expect the same unsatisfactory product. Viva makes two paper towel products.

These do not absorb whatsoever

I have purchased VIVA for decades and have always rated them way about the best. I will always use the better ones VIFA produces. Furthermore, I can't say whether the Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels,12 rolls lasted 1/2 as long as the regular VIFA. They are not much better than store brand.

I don’t like anything about this product. Even cutting my fingers they are so hard.

Been quite a while since I was as disappointed as I am with the new Viva. The towel is thin, not cloth-like, tears and rips easily. In general, an inferior towel now to Brawny. C'mon Viva.

Any other time I have bought the Viva brand, it has always been that luxurious thick paper towel which I have come to expect. This is like someone went to the dollar store and put it in a viva box. So disappointing!!

In the advertisement these paper towels seem to behave like cloth would, but in reality (In my photos) they feel hard and perform like ordinary paper towels.It's the Northern Viva Signature that's cloth-like.  May cost more but you can actually dust and clean house with them.

These paper towels are not up to usual Viva cloth paper towels. The rolls are loose so you get fewer towels, texture is so rough I expected to see wood chips. I'd put them on par with Sparkle brand.Picture on right is new roll, on left old roll. You can easily see the difference in amount of paper per roll.

I like the towels, but the rolls are loosely wound and don't have very much on them.  Burn through them real quick.  Not a good value, they are causing me to go the washable "dish rag" route.

Was looking for the soft paper towels that feel like cloth (misleading package) these are bumpy and rough. Wanted for fathers fragile skin. Using as paper towels but still need soft cloths!

I buy viva paper towels because they are strong absorbent and even they are always more expensive they were worth it. Now they have a a multi surface towel which are terrible.I can’t even get them off my paper towel holder without them ripping. No to mention they are so flimsy you need a bunch just for a spill.

I truly do not like this multi surface cloth!! This is just like some dollar store paper towel! Im use to buying the Viva Signature cloth!! So don't waste your money!

I was looking to buy cloth towels, same brand, but it was cloth. This is just regular paper

Very rough and have to use more than two when using for wiping, drying messes etc. not the same as other Viva products purchased in stores

According to the description these were supposed to be the cloth-like Viva paper towels, but they are the regular paper ones that start to disintegrate as soon as they get wet.

This is much coarser than in my past orders very disappointed

These are regular paper towels that you get in any other brand, only these cost more. I guess I should have read more closely and when it said cloth paper towels, I should have assumed that they were not being truthful but trying to deceive people. I will NOT buy these again ever.

They are regular size rolls. I wouldn’t waste my money on them again!!

This is my fault for not reading closely, but these are definitely NOT the same as the Viva "Signature Cloth" paper towels. These just feel like cheap regular paper towels and the rolls are really small and loosely rolled like the kind you buy at the dollar store.

I thought viva paper towels were the ones that cling to the roll and feel like cloth. These are just regular paper towels like any other brand. Rough, non absorbent… like a roll of regular paper almost. I’m really disappointed and now I have 11 more rolls to get through (living alone) before I can find a better brand. I don’t know what this is but these are not the viva paper towels I’ve used before. Maybe there are “special” viva paper towels? And these are the basic ones? I’d like to know so I can find the ones I thought I was buying. But if you’re looking for the good paper towels, these are DEFINITELY NOT THEM.

I did not realize these were so cheap. The paper towels were thin, and loose on the roll.

Absorbency

Product is ok, but it took sooo long to get  here.

This paper towel is pretty much like all the rest of them, not like the Viva I used to rely on for strong fibers and a sturdy cleaning cloth-type paper towel.

Wrong towels I thought it was what I usually get but it was not.

After washing my hands and drying them with the paper towels, they felt sticky.

Feels like a generic paper towel.

These are hard and scratchy

These are small rolls, maybe 20 uses. You can get a better deal at target.

This isn't what I'm used to buying. Product has declined to a cheap cloth.

Its thinner than ones bought in stores. Not sure if I chose the wrong one? Since there is  not much description difference on Viva paper towels listed online.

My recent purchase of Viva was like a cheap store brand.Doesn’t have the nice cloth feel . I have been buying Viva cloth surface towels for years. What happened?

Bounty is the way to go! Purchased these because my regular bounty was out of stock… mistake . My husband complained until we used them all. They don’t tear evenly & they are not thick enough to really absorb the way a paper-towel should. They are fine if your using them as a napkin but not going for cleaning or wiping up larger spills…

So I love viva paper towels and always have bc of how strong they are made.  You can get it wet and use it like a washcloth, but not with these.  These are just like all the other paper towels.

These were nothing like they used to be! I could have bought the cheapest brand and it would be the same. Don't waste your money!

Product works like normal paper towels but cost more.

What I always liked about Viva was the incredible soft feel and quick absorbent quality of said paper towel. Now... I might as well buy the cheapest towel out there instead of the expensive one that feels like the cheap course one and slow on the absorbency.

I could have paid less and received more at my local grocery store. I'm not sure what deal I'm getting by buying these through Amazon.Feeling like I've been ripped off.

I absolutely hate the way these towels feel.  You can use the cloth version on your face- these towels will scratch your skin.  I hate these.

Thought I’d try these but the green pack is much more absorbent and you can use less. I went through these so fast. Won’t buy again

The aren't as clothlike as the ones I buy in the store although they have the same name.

Our household buys Viva paper towels from the supermarket and they are great, cloth like, and super absorbent. This version is not. These are cheap quality thin bargain quality at a higher price. Be sure to get the purple package viva paper towels if you are looking for the good ones.

They’re paper towels and work like paper towels. I will admit I didn’t really read the description well, so that’s on me. They only have the good cloth-like Viva paper towels in stores around me so I just saw the brand name and thought that was what I was buying. These multi-surface ones are just regular paper towels. Live and learn.

Have used Viva brand for years. This is not consistent with the Viva, instead like a generic brand.Ordered twice. Same result. Won't order again.

Not what I expected. Will not be purchasing again.

These are basic paper towels. Not the classic fabric feeling Viva Paper Towels that you normally get in the stores. Disappointing.

We've had these paper towels on our subscribe and save for years without issue. This mot recent order didn't look quite right when I opened the packaging so I pulled out a roll from our last shipment. Sure enough, the most recent shipment has much less on the roll than the previous but the price has stayed the same. Looking back through my years of orders I am now realizing they have gone from 143 sheets per roll in 2021 to 110 sheets per roll in 2022 and now apparently has dropped to 81 sheets per roll without any change in price. What a scam.

These are shown as being multiply cloth like towels. I purchased Viva in Texas and I was very impressed with the thickness and the texture. These are very thin and cheap I am totally dissatisfied.

I purchased these because they were more "cloth like" they changed their entire product. So disappointed!

We have been using Viva paper towels for years. These are either a rip off of the actual brand, or they have changed the towels. These are not durable at all. If you have to wipe anything up off of carpet... it's ripping apart. It also doesn't hold the water the way the original brand did. It leaves a water residue on the counters. I am so disappointed that I now have a case of these to go through until I can HOPEFULLY get the right kind from the store. Buyer beware.

I love Viva Towels! For me there is no better paper towel!  But,,,the delivery is another story! I live all the way around the back of the house and am a Senior Citizen, so the one thing I don1t  hope for besides getting an in transit damaged product , is having it delivered to the WRONG door. Most of the time , that`s what happens so I would be extremely happy if Amazon `s people would read & follow the delivery instructions and get it right!  Thank you!

I was excited, thought I got a deal on prime day, but really I overpaid for off brand paper towels with very few per roll. Don’t buy these! They aren’t normal Viva! They aren’t cloth like!.. They don’t even have 1/2 as many paper towels per roll as competitors! Don’t fall for this scam, they are way cheaper in store!

I feel they are not as nice as Sam’s brand towels.  I am going back.  Durability:  okay.  Performance:  okay.  Texture:  poor.  Roll size:  Very Small

I thought I would be getting the thick Viva rolls that are sold in the big box stores.. HA!!!  these rolls are so thin, they are crap!!!  I spent almost 20$ on 18 rolls and am so upset that I wasted that money!  Dollar Tree has a better product to offer for 1$ each roll!!!  I will NEVER but these again off Amazon.

Disappointed with the consistency of these. They used to be so much thicker and now they feel more papery and just not as good quality

👎👎 This has been one of my favorite cleaning/kitchen tool. That’s why when I received the info, I purchased it without hesitating.Big disappointment!😝😡Different quality (very thin not as absorbing as the real product)Small rolls, I was going to send it back, but I don’t want to be bothered.I wouldn’t purchase it again. Sorry Amazon, but it is what it is. 👎

I thought this paper towel was cloth like. Its not and the rolls are skimpy

I bought these expecting the soft, cloth-like Viva that I usually buy at the supermarket.  They're not.Called by the moniker Multi Surface Cloth, these paper towel are barely a step above the bargain brands.  They're thin, but with waffling fibers.  They do not hold up as well as the regular Viva, and they are NOT soft.If you want these qualities,  then buy these towels.

It's not as think as it use to be. The quality of the paper is thin and the rolls are not as tight as before. Quality went down but prices goes up. Well that is with most companies now days.Thanks for asking.

I bought these thinking I was getting a great deal because they were super rolls . They are not super rolls they are single rolls. That is false advertising and I am very disappointed that I did not get what they claimed I was getting.

Not as soft as product purchased locally.

I don’t care for this new Viva paper towel, so I will be canceling that. It’s not what I expected to possibly there is another choice. This is not what I wanted but I’m not going to return it it’ll do for now.

Prefer when it was a former softer cloth like towel. Not a good value for similar brands.

These weren't the strong, thick, cloth like ones I've bought in the past. The price reflects that. They are fine for easy clean ups, light cleaning, and wiping hands.

The Multi Purpose PT by Viva is only  a 1 ply, not  as strong as brand bounty 2 ply. Like other shoppers I thought I was buying original Viva the cloth like texture PT, my bad, those are called Viva Signature, Viva marketing team  did a great job in introducing a new product by confusing customers, that said this new multi purpose is only a 1 Ply towel so it isn't as strong as other brand name multi purpose 2 ply PT, (comparing apples to apples) so for multi purpose use I will not purchase again. I will buy the Viva Signature PT (cloth like) as intended for special uses. Value so so for a 1 ply

Have used these for a few years. I pay extra for the better quality of this product. Until the last few orders. Viva seems to have changed how these are made. Quality is the same as other cheaper options now.

Usually buy at store. This batch poor quality. Had to go to store for bounty as this stuff unravelled and and frayed during use

These were more like regular paper towels. I have purchased Viva before at Walmart and they were more cloth like very durable.  These were not the same.

It cleans as you would expect it to

The otherVIVA I have gotten from the store are Stretchy and very strong. These have ridges and they say VIVA on them. The ridges are like a pattern and they do not last as long as the other Vivas that I get at the store!…..so disappointed.

I thought viva only made one kind of paper towels and that’s the cloth like paper towels that were hard to tear and good for cleaningmesses well these are not them this is a super tiny roll compared to double and triple rolls from the rival paper towel companies! I’m not impressed and I feel as though I’ve wasted money! My fiancé says he doesn’t think they suck but he has no idea about brands and this isn’t what viva use to sale!

Used to be Best, now Just ok

I have loved Viva for a very long time. But I was a bit disappointed with this version. It just doesn’t have the same feel as I expect from Viva. It feels more like the cheapy brands. It has always reminded me of a towel feel but these has a more paper feel. While they do the job, I will make sure I check the kind next time.

I used it for everyday cleaning.The material and the size of rolls wasn't what I wanted.The rolls were small I thought I ordered triple rolls and the material wasn't what I ordered went through too fast.

they feel very cheap and are not as absorbent. they get the job done but i wouldnt buy again

not soft like before

I thought these would be a different type of Viva towel, but it’s more just like a standard paper towel. You don’t get any of that cloth like.

These were not as soft as I'd hoped.  But still good.

I was expecting a bigger roll but...they work good but you really don't get enough for the money you're charged. The rolls are very small so I don't think I'll be getting these again.

My favorite paper towel  not sure why this one wasn't as full and soft . I still love Viva , will check if it's 2 types

Overpaid. Could’ve gotten these for less and the same day at the local store. Not as soft as the Viva Signature Cloth

These are coarse not as soft as the ones I bought befor

the Viva towels i normally get are softer i will stick with the store ones

The towels were hard paper not like viva towels you buy in the store. Next time I’ll buy Amazon brand

not the softest but I don't mind because you dont use as much and save money!

These are efficient. But not my favorite. They don’t tear off clean and are not super absorbing. They get the job done though.

These were described as “soft”….compared to what?! Sandpaper?  However, They do hold up well.  Not as advertised.

Rough and doesn’t absorb much. Not worth the price

I really dislike the Viva in the stores now. It used to be the BEST, but …. I tried this one but not satisfied with it either.

Very thin unlike store bought

Careful, get the other size (super). The rolls are smaller than they appear in the images.

I thought they where they cloth like towels but they where normal  paper towels

Like these, but wish the rolls were bigger

Not the ones I wanted but they’ll work. Viva has another paper towel that’s thicker & that’s what I was hoping these were. The others are hard to find & amazing!

I thought the sheets would be thicker.

I love viva don't get me wrong, but I'm not fond of the smaller sheets the way the absorb is not as good as the original. I've personally noticed that I've used more of these than I have to the original. I'm going back to the real Viva no substitute for me.

I was disappointed in this box of Viva Paper towels. The ones I had bought many times at the store were thicker and much more absorbant than these and a roll would last much longer. I think I will look for them again when I go to the store and see is they all have changed this much. Sadly Disappointed.

Select a size on these is ok but unlike some other name brands, it takes 2 small pieces to dry my hands all the way. Other brands I have noticed it only takes 1. I would say these fall in line medium use paper towels. Not lint free either.

Have purchased this product retail and was extremely impressed. The strength and durability were long lasting while the hand was soft. The towel’s received were nothing different than a House Brand paper towel. No comparison to purchase made retail. Feel like a bait and switch. Very bad business. Not knowing where fault lies Amazon or Manufacture have caution about ever purchasing again. Shame as was ready to switch brands for home / business.

I'm not too thrilled with these, they unroll to the point of 3 and 4 at a time to where you have to keep rolling them back on the towel holder so your not tearing off way more then you need. Sloppy! I will stay with the cloth like type from now on, no more of these.

I bought these thinking I was purchasing a normal paper towel. They are not like most towels. When wet, they are very limp and thin but strong. Better for wet wiping than absorbing spills. They stay strong when wet, although they seem flimsy, and work best for me to wet clean something and I use them almost like a wet rag. For kitchen duty I'll stick with Bounty.

I like the size of the paper towels, but they aren't very absorbent and they tear kind of easily

There are some things you just can’t go cheap on.  Like cheese.  And paper towels.  This is a thinner, rougher quality viva than what I’m used to.  Perhaps that’s my own fault.  It doesn’t clean up spills like the quality Viva.  Will be switching.

I wanted the SAME Texture paper towels as in the past. This type was different. Last time I’ll be ordering these.

I like the feel of Viva towels which is why I buy them. These do not feel like Viva towels. Not even close. If I had known they were like other paper towels, would not have bought them. Other than the feel, they are fine and are like regular named paper towels.

These are NOT the sturdy viva! They’ll do the job but you need like 5 if you’re cleaning with them or wiping a surface that has a stain.I should’ve looked closer at which ones I was buying. They’ll get the job done just not durable.

Good for the price but definitely not the cloth feel like regular Viva.

These are just pretty good but not like the regular Viva.  So I was disappointed.  I won’t purchase them again.  The Amazon version of Bounty are better.

Not the same texture Viva paper towels I have bought.  They must have switched the paper or something.  Still did the job.

I was accustomed to the quality and durability of their "cloth like" paper towels, so decided to try these.  Nope.  Are basically any regular paper towels.  Ok if I was getting for cheap use.  Not getting again.  Going back to their "like cloth" product quality.

These paper towels are nothing like the soft, almost cloth like ones you get in the grocery store. Not the Viva I know and love 😔

My bad. I thought I was reordering Viva Signature towels. Instead I mistakenly ordered these "multi-surface" towels, which are not near lyas good. They're okay, like something you'd pick up at the 7-11, but not soft like Signature. Another example of a company degrading a brand for a few more dollars in the short run.

Viva paper towels are my current favorites.  They are a bit hard to tear off the roll, but on the other hand, they are strong and absorbant.

they look good and work good and do what i supposed to do and then some.

…not as good as the Viva signature cloth.

These are by far the best paper towels around and I’ve tried several, both name brand and store brand. Best part is the are small sized sheet to on use what you need so less waste.Use a single sheet for a lot of common jobs.Only issue is that this is the smaller size rolls, refined going for the larger size for better value.

Nice and thick, not cheap at all.

Nice paper towel, but I ended up getting the wrong kind. I wanted "signature cloth" but I got "multi-surface cloth" which sounds like it would be better, right?... Nope. Lol. It's still paper towel-ish, where as the other ones were actually "cloth like."

Value is great for price. Strong and makes cleaning easy. Thick enough for even cleanser and bleach

Ok

VIVA has been my favorite paper towel for 10 years!!  I have been given the name of the paper towel nat** (I do not want to offend anyone).  I make you use them only for certain things and use as few as possible. This is due to the price.  But with Viva they can be rinsed and used many times, like when wiping countertops.  This makes them go far for the money and I have to not be as strict.  I thought I would try this new type as it looked like it would be more cost effective.  I like them but there are so many less, we are going through them very fast. I will be going back to the original type when these are gone.I decorate cakes, using both fondant, and buttercream icings.  These towels are fantastic for smoothing out the icings. Look up the technique on YouTube.  They are the best for this.I can never be without my Viva but will go back to.the original type.

These particular VIVA papertowels are identical to the Scott papertowels.  I won't buy them again.

Thinner than I'd like, but they will do .

Product did its job however it is not the cloth like product I was expecting.

Not as soft as they used to be

It’s good for wiping messes. The course paper makes dirt comes off easier.

These are not the smooth viva paper towels that are great to use as watercolor artist.  ( I tried looking at the displayed photo from the manufacturer, but it is not easy to tell so I’m including a photo). These have a pattern on them and are not the absorbent cloth like the viva paper towels that are only found in some grocery stores (such as Publix, at least in the Atlanta area).  These are just run of the mill type paper towels.  If anyone can guide me to the smooth absorbent ones, please do!  Artist everywhere will appreciate it!

Good strength and great for window cleaning.

Good paper towels but I like the tight originals better

I have been a Viva fan for a long time.  That being said, I was expecting the same nice soft paper towel.  What I found was that it has been changed.  Now it has the texture of another brand towel and is not as soft as it used to be.  If this is infact another offering from Viva and they still offer the same old soft variety I do not know.  I will look and see if I can still get what I am used to.

I was expecting the soft, fabric-like, Viva towels but these are more like Scott paper towels. That's fine but I will know to order the standard Viva in the future.

Viva are the best paper towels.  They holdup like cloth. Strong and absorbent. Just wring them out and reuse several times.  My complaint with these particular towels is they are half sized.  I like a full sized towel, or a wider towel.  To each their own.  Maybe this size is good for you?

Good standard paper towels 🧻 I have ordered a couple times.  Good price.

I swear these were made to force you into accidentally tearing off more than you need so you blast through them. I could never just get one. Very annoying. They are a good paper towel tho, low lint.

I am a spoiled brat of Viva CLOTH paper towels!! I will always pay the high price for them! But the last 2 times that I've ordered them, & I buy in bulk, they have sent me GOOD Viva towels, but NOT the CLOTH ones that I'm spoiled by getting! And yes, I'm ordering the exact same ones that I've always ordered... so what's up, Viva?? Where's my CLOTH towels?

I like the price and the thikness of the product

They are as good as bounty. Nice towel.  I am still trying to decide which one I will continue using …this is good quality, but not the original reusable viva I used when my kids were little (too many) years ago.

Not really happy. Texture is totally different.  Doesn't seem as durable or absorbent as the past package I purchased.  I seem to use more and roll doesn't seem as big. Not happy.

The paper towels were exactly what I wanted

Cleaning, spills. Thicker than many, not soft like used to be

Standard

These are just a regular higher end paper towel. The ones you're probably looking for are Viva Signature Cloth.  They work just fine, but aren't as durable as the cloth-like ones.

These weren't as the cloth ones. No I want purchase again.

More for ur money

not absorbent

Good deal.

Good product

It says "cloth" on it so I thought they were the other ones. I should have looked at the pictures.

A bit ruff to use as a napkin  but

Not the one I thought it was but good

They are indeed paper towels and they do all things expected of paper towels

Great value!

This is not as good as their purple wrapping type, but it’s good. Does the job and is strong.

I'm like many men, insofar as I'm a creature of habit.  I like routine, and while I enjoy exploring and doing new things for adventure and excitement, I prefer my day-to-day life to be stable.  I like coming home to a house where I know where everything is.  I like driving a car which I know the feel of intimately.  I like clothing that feels consistent and thus comfortable.  I like having a regular schedule.  And yes, I usually buy the exact same things when I go to the store.My mom bought Bounty paper towels when I was growing up, and I've followed along with that example throughout my adulthood.  Tissues = "Kleenex," and paper towels = "Bounty" to my mind.So, getting these for review (as an "Amazon Vine" reviewer) was actually stepping slightly outside of my ordinary comfort zone.  Sounds silly, but it's true.So, I'm now about six rolls into the cycle.  I use paper towels for a LOT of things, from using a "half-sheet" as a napkin, to using them to pat meat dry or do other tasks while cooking, or cleaning up after pets or using them for other household cleaning tasks.And so far, I NEARLY forget that I'm not using the same towels I've used for most of my half-century-plus of life.  These are just as absorbant, just as robust, and generally just as useful as the ones I've always bought.  And at a slightly lower price point, to boot!They aren't QUITE as soft at the paper towels I'm accustomed to... they don't have the same pillow-y "quilting" as that other brand name.  This doesn't make them less useful in any way, but it is a noticeable, if effectively irrelevant, difference.It's really more of a mental context shift.  Being used to the "feel" of the other brand, it takes a bit of "unlearning" to get used to using these.  But now that I have, I can safely say, I'd very seriously  consider switching over to them permanently, and will make my purchase choice, in the future, primarily based upon sales price, when choosing between these two brands.As long as these are even slightly less expensive than the brand I've always bought...  I'll choose these, instead!

Product: Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels, Task Size - 12 Super Rolls (2 Packs of 6) = 18 Regular Rolls (81 Sheets Per Roll)Viva makes two types of paper towels: this one and their Signature Cloth towel that is more like a cloth. This one is what I consider their everyday paper towel. I use it more for general, everyday uses where I don’t want or need a super soft, absorbent paper towel. I wouldn’t compare these with something like Bounty. They just aren’t, and I don’t think meant to be, that level of paper towel. See my picture from the back of the package that compares the two types of their paper towels.While it’s not their premium paper towel, it’s still fairly absorbent and strong. It’s also lint free.It works for wiping down surfaces without leaving behind any lint and cleaning up small spills. I can do light scrubbing with it. The extra quilting makes it a better choice for cleaning over the Signature line. It’s definitely more cost effective than a premium paper towel. I’m glad to have an option since I often don’t really need a premium paper towel.The first two product pictures are a bit confusing. You get 2 packages of 6 super rolls for a total of 12 rolls. The second picture reflects how the paper towels actually come. I like it coming in two packages instead of one big package since it makes storing it easier for me.This is a solid mid range paper towel for me.

I have used "Viva" paper towels before, and really liked them for the softness, thickness and absorbency... this one is just OK, it is definitely thick but like rough textured, it does pretty good as far as absorbency, and the "Task Size" is the right size in my opinion, it is more on the small size, but that way you can use just one sheet if you need it for a small task, and go up from there. It also does a great job on many surfaces without scratching.

These are decent paper towels. They're textured different than the other big brand I use but they still do a good job of absorbing and cleaning up a mess. I would use them again.

I got these to see what the difference was between these and regular paper towels. These are not as soft as viva towels, but I think that is on purpose. They are meant for multi surface cleaning so they won't break down as easy. Works great for multi-use options.

i have used these to wipe the floors from spills and wipe the counter tops down. They work well. They are similar to great value brand paper towels. They get the job done

These are decent paper towels. I anticipated the ones the feel more like cloth than paper.

Within a week, I got a case of Brawny's top paper towel and this Viva paper towel.  Now that we're a month or so into it, I'm going to say that each are the best choice.  The Brawny is amazing top quality, but is also 160% of the cost.  The Viva is very on par for the cost.  Still a solid choice all around but hard to match that value.

Love these paper towels, excellent quality and great value for the money

These are great paper towels. Unfortunately, stores like Target and others only carry the signature cloth which I really don't like. The texture just isn't the same and doesn't do as good of a job as the multi surface.

Great quality and value for money. I always buy this brand when at the store, but is a great deal when I can't make it there.

I love this product because it feels like a wash cloth.  Great for clean ups.

Viva paper towels are great. I have found them to be excellent at cleaning spills, wiping down counters and tabletops and general household cleaning.  It is not a cloth towel however it’s the closest I’ve had in a paper product.  It’s going to sound corny but I have to go with the Elvis Presley hit “Viva Las Vegas” but it’s “Viva the paper towels”.

I love Viva paper towels. They are different than all other paper towels. They absorb well so they are a great value.

best paper towel on the market more pricey but it wipes up spills like a cloth great to wipe a small face or use as napkin and can be rinsed

How about a coupon credit for next purchaseHigh praiseCleans well

I used these tulip liners to make individual cinnamon rolls.  The white liners, specifically, stuck to the rolls and upon cooling became nearly impossible to remove.  The item description states that these are "greaseproof," but I did not find that to be the case.  The butter from the rolls leaked through and saturated the paper.  In many cases, as I attempted to remove the cinnamon rolls, bits of the paper liner were left clinging to the roll.  The brown kraft liners, by contrast, slipped free from the cinnamon rolls like I'd expect greaseproof paper to do, which made the performance of the white liners all the more disappointing.

The parchment colored liners are great, but everything sticks to the white and brown. Don't get the mixed option. Everything else about these liners I love. The size, shape, and functionality.

These cupcake papers are horrible! The oils soak into the paper, and the folds come apart while baking so your cupcakes come out in the shape of pinwheels. You can't decorate the cupcakes properly because there is no room on the top as the paper folds go in almost all the way to the center. Maybe an extremely thick batter would make them hold their shape, but I definitely do not recommend this product!

They are just square sheets of wax paper folded. Theres nothing holding the fold in place. Therefore it expands during baking and makes dents in the cupcakes.Cupcakes also stick severely and a lot pulls off.The high tops make it impossible to frost cupcakesI cant see any reason to choose these

With anything to do with food, I always look for non-Chinese manufacturers because I don’t trust them. I will pay more to not get Chinese manufactured products. This product description says the manufacturer is in Sweden. The box is labeled made in China.

These cups are not the quality as I have purchased before. The paper is vey thin and does not stand up to the dough when it's put in the cups. Not satisfied at all.

Reading the information about this product falsely makes you believe it’s from Sweden. Clearly labeled Made in China so Very Slim Chance this seller is being honest about Nordic Paper from Sweden. 😡

Last time I checked, the terms Nordic and Sweden did not relate to the country of China. Therefore product information is misleading, especially with products being used for food.

One was for cupcakes but the other I needed were muffin cups both were for cupcake.  I was disappointed

Avoid purchasing culinary items made in China.

They did not stay together.

This supposed to be made in Europe?  Packaging says China! Misleading advertising.

I made savoury muffins and the cups opened while i was putting the dough in. Never again.

When we received the package it was already open, dont really trust using it

Not the size described. Arrived late. All around disappointment.

Too small was not large

Very misleading advertising.

These cute little papers seemed to work really well for the dense muffins I made and them! The oil did seep through the paper but it didn't seem to make the paper greasy if that makes sense. It's very thin parchment paper type liner material but they seem to be really sturdy and they peel away so beautifully from my muffins. I love the size because you can make standard size muffins and cupcakes in them or because of the height of the wrapper you can use them for larger cupcakes or muffins as well. I can definitely see myself repurchasing these in the future, I think they'll fit cocoa bombs really nicely this winter so that could be great!

These tulip shaped papers are non stick parchment that bake evenly. Plus they are a very cute way to serve muffins or cupcakes. Good value too.

I do a lot of baking and used to use plan muffin tin liners.  I wasn’t happy with those so thought I’d give Tulip liners a try and am very happy to have found these.  I absolutely love baking with these and makes clean up and baking a lot easier.  These also elevate the appearance of my baked goods.What I love:Lightweight, easy to use, sturdy, prevents the grease/oil from bleeding thru, appearanceWhat I don’t like:These are a bit too tall for what I’ve been using them for lately and I kinda wish they were about 1/2inch shorter.  However if you are baking something like jumbo muffins or big cupcakes these would likely work for you.

The only, albeit remote, downside is these need to be used w/ muffin pans; however they COMPLETELY ROCK and they're VERY easy to get out of these very well designed muffins cups (they don't stick!)

They don’t stick to my pan and they are perfectly big enough if you overfill! These muffins have cream cheese in the middle and I tend to add way too much batter but they hold up very well! Very aesthetically pleasing to the eye for that bakery muffin look 🤩

Smaller than I expected, a little shorter, and thinner. They’ll work out, smaller cupcakes and muffins will be alright.Family favorite,  banana chocolate chip muffins

These liners are stunning!  I have never baked in this style of liner because some people say the "folded parchment" style leaks batter out. I thought I'd bake my muffin in the pan and slip them in the liner for transport after they cooled.  However, after I inspected them, it was clear to me there was no way they'd leak.  My muffins baked BEAUTIFULLLY.  Made it easy for people to grab and go during a big event. Love these!

I bought another brand and the muffins stuck and it made a real mess. These ones were far superior. Came out clean

I had been eyeing these for very long time. Honestly, I don’t know why it took me so long to finally purchase these cupcake liners.  I love, baking and cupcakes are my favorite things to make. When I make cupcakes, they are always for my family and friends.  As you can imagine, presentation is important when you’ve perfected your cupcake recipe. These cupcake liners are easy to use and The way it makes my cupcakes look professional is an added bonus!  I just got these and have made over five dozen cupcakes in the past couple weeks. My coworkers say I’m giving the local bake shop a run for their money. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to regular cupcake liners.

We cook pretty much everything from scratch in our house. This helps a lot. Muffins and egg bites (like Starbucks) are so much better now and makes clean up 1000% easier. We usually go through 2 packs of those a month. So worth it.

I have purchased several different types of these cups and this one is the best. It is real parchment. Others I've purchased call themselves parchment but turn out to be wax paper. Although these behave just like cupcake papers, they have one thing that makes them very frustrating: when you lift a baked item up by the paper corners, the paper comes off the food and the folds separate: if you're not careful, the food will fall out of the paper. I supposed that's a testiment to the non-stick properties and I've never tried these with cupcakes (I make little pastries with traditional pie crust).

Material from Sweden. I should have pay more attention before I buy.

The base of these cups is very small and doesn’t even fill the footprint of a standard Muffin pan cup. I had to use another cup to flatten them out so that they would fill the base of the cavity.

I loved the value of them and the size! Also enjoyed that they kept cupcakes from drying out after baking but the only thing I wasn’t too happy with that that the folds would be hard to pipe buttercream  around and would deeply be baked into the cupcake instead of holding its round shape.

These looked good, but if you don’t pick them up with 2 hands the liner falls off and the cupcake falls out of the liner - not sturdy or grease resistant- should have spent more money

Not the best quality as some of the others available. Not for jumbo Muffins or large Muffins as these are the same as a reg sized Cupcake. If you need a smaller muffin then these would be ok. I would not bake cupcakes in them as the butter and or oil would definitely be apparent on these liners. However The packaging was good.

I think these are ok but, the oil of the cupcakes leave an ugly ring on the paper. It’s not a great look when I make these for friends and family.

I was using these for a few months, and loved them. But recently I noticed a change in the paper & now they come out of the oven with ugly greasy spots! Back to the search for a good grease proof liner!

Really disappointed in these liners, all of my cupcakes have grease rings. 4 dozen baked for an order.

They work for their intended purpose but they are very thin and not grease-proof. For the price I would buy again.

I loved these liners....until I started using the darkest brown ones. The lighter colors worked perfectly but the darkest color has sticking issues. I've baked the same recipe and never had any problems but muffins stick for some reason to those.  I would buy again if I can just buy in light color only. I would have given 5 stars to those. They look great.*update* I can purchase the natural color or white separately and will do so!

Not what I was expecting. Very flimsy. Returned

pretty paper cups separate while baking; muffin or cupcake ends up a weird shape. too bad...

they're wimpy

Bought these for my business, and the item description and pictures lead me to believe they were a decent size. The bottoms are smaller than a normal cupcake liner. And they don't look as tall as described. Not super pleased with the size, but hopefully they work the way they should

Cake mix got sticky and cups so small.

Very thin paper when baking.  I had to double uo

I haven't put the Bake Choice Cupcake Liners to use yet.  Love the tulip design.  I have no doubt theywill work just fine.  Wouldn't make cupcakes or muffins without liners and these are just the ones Iwanted.

They come out of the box beautiful. But beware that when you go to bake any sort of batter will cause the edges to loosen and the liner to expand. These cause strange shaped cupcakes. They seem like a loosely glued parchment paper. I was super excited to get them until they started falling apart.

I’m super bummed. I love the look of these liners and they peel away very well from the cupcake. Although the batter sneaks into the folds :( which than makes it hard to pipe. I can still use them to fancy up a cupcake after the fact but I can’t use them as the primary liners to bake in.Sidenote: I was doing a vegan recipe so perhaps it was more runny than a typical recipe. So if your batter is stiffer than it may be ok. Cause than as it bakes it may push on the edges and create a nice circle🤷‍♀️

Won't be good for muffins as I like large, not small muffins.  My fault as I should have read details more carefully.  Will give most away as I wanted large tulip cups for my large muffins.

Came damaged and wet. Otherwise they would have been ok.

Don’t fill it to high. The pleats will open

I  really like the tan & black papers they are super easy to handle & fill Don’t care for the white ones at all I use a fail proof recipe for  super moist  cupcakes ( # recipetin )that I make exactly the same way every time . I cooked 3 different batches with these & and have deduced I have to dbl up the papers & reduce oven from 350 to 325 or they get to hot and draws to much  moisture out of them Pics are of 3rd batch First batch was  way to  dry 2nd batch with 2 papers & lower temp were  excellent 3rd. Batch at 325 with single papers were a tad dry (see pic) I may look for a heavier paper or buy these again  in just the tan or black color

I like to use these papers for large muffins. I haven't had the papers stick. The only downside is they flatten out easily if they aren't supported by muffin tins. Be sure to only fill them if they have something to hold them up on the sides or they will pour out.

Overall okay. A few cupcakes still pulled away from the liner a little.

These are great. They do lose a bit of structure thoug after baking

I don't think I filled the cups with enough batter so I struggled to frost them. Once they're placed in a cupcake baking tin, don't be afraid to fill them up.

These didn't perfectly fit the standard muffin tin diameter (a little small) and because they're tuliped, they open a bit and batter gets between the folds a bit.Updated to add: Wow! Great customer service! The brand was very responsive in reaching out and offering me a refund after my review. They're under the impression that these cups do fit most standard size muffin tins. Perhaps my muffin tin is a bit bigger? I've attached a photo of how the cups fit in the muffin tin for reference

The added height of the liner keeps the muffin dough from spreading and making a mess on my tins. My muffins look professional and elegant in my cake pan. The paper is a tad bit too thin, IMHO, not as thick as a standard muffin paper liner but they work.

Just received.  Looking forward to using these. I was just confused as the box notes Made in China but on this website description it says parchment paper from Sweden.

I like the papers they’re perfect for the small cupcake tins but I use the big cupcake tins and I don’t think these will work as well for the big ones. I am going to check back with you to see if you have a larger size.

These liners help the muffins rise with a dome rather than flatten. Plus the muffins look lovely and professional. The paper is a bit thinner than the more expensive liners.

These liners don't work as well as the parchment paper ones I got from the grocery store but those were much pricier and only came in a 12 pack. They stick a a little bit more and don't fit my muffin tins perfectly but work just fine and are a much much better deal in my opinion. I will be buying them again

Cups look fancier than plain cups. I gave four stars because the cups sometimes separate too easily after baking when handling the cupcakes. The liner pulls away from the cake.

These peel nicely and had no leaks. The liners did not fill the entire muffin slot. Other than that they worked nicely.

These cupcake liners add a touch of unique class to your cupcakes. I used them for my father-in-law's birthday party. They seemed to work just fine.

Perfect size for muffin tins. A little thin.

Sent to my mother who bakes. She’s pleased

They aren't my absolute favorite, but the quality and cost are worth the buy.My preference has nothing to do with the parchment itself, I just prefer a short lotus style. However, those have had a drastic leap in pricing and are not worth the cost.

I received 200 Tulip Cupcake Liners in brown, white and natural colors. The package contained 100 dark brown and 50 each in white and gold. They came well packaged in a plastic bag, in a box, with a spacer at the top to prevent damage to the shape of the papers.The Tulip liners are indeed about 2 inches in diameter at the bottom as described in the product listing. Some small cupcake pans I've had for 30 years, do have a 2 inch diameter bottom to them. Newer pans I own (e.g. Ekco T120) have a 2 1/8 inch diameter bottom leaving plenty of room for these liners to slide around. The sides of the liners are much more vertical than any of my pans so the gap between liner and pan widens as you reach the top of a pan cup.I ran a small test batch of muffins in the small cupcake pan to see how these liners performed.  I was curious if the liners would hold their shape or open up to fit the cup's sides. I filled the liners with a little under 1/3 cup of batter and placed in the oven set to 425F. The muffins and liners came out looking good but the liners did open to fit the pan during baking. I may run another test in the newer, regular pans but I don't expect that to go very well. Unfortunately, I only have 2 of the smaller cup pans which will limit me to baking 12 muffins at a time if the larger pans won't work.The liners work well and prevent batter from seeping. They did not burn or scorch at 425F. The liner's almost vertical sides are hard to fill and do not fit my pans well.

I love the variety in the colors and the liners come in a column so they're easy to store. I hadn't used liners this tall before and I was worried about decorations getting messed up. The liner comes off from the cake easily, but leaves indents (unless I did it wrong?). I think it's a professional looking way to display muffins or cupcakes.

If you don't care about it showing the cupcake on the sides then get them. These baked really well and I will be buying again. However, they are not grease proof. I purchased these for wedding cupcakes and they do show the grease on the sides. It's not too bad tho. But they were the perfect cupcake size will definitely be ordering more. Just beware of that for looks

I used these for a ‘bakery look’ for my homemade muffins.  So fun!  I took them to a bridal shower brunch as I was bring the gluten free muffins and wanted them to blend I. With the hosts other offerings.  Perfect!

We were pleasantly surprised with these low cost specialty muffin cups (liners). They present amazingly and release the muffin really well. After opening them it becomes a flat piece of paper see the photo). We did not spray these with non stick spray and they still released well. Probably depends on how much oil is in your recipe. These are smaller but perfect for your daily muffins.

I used these cupcake liners for our school bake sale, and they made my cupcakes look bakery quality! The neutral colors are so versatile for different themes.They were easy to pull apart and came off the muffins and cupcakes effortlessly. No complaints at all. I can’t wait to use them again!

Like many people this summer, I rushed to buy these to make "authentic" Olympic Village chocolate muffins. Very happy with the quality. They held their shape nicely in my standard cupcake pan and came off easily. Yes, you'll get dents in your muffin/cupcake from the folds but I think that's inevitable. Good price for the quantity and quality.

Very happy with these. Of all the muffin wraps we have used these  have been the best. I'd definitely recommends these. We'll worth it and adds a nice look to our muffins.

I bought the regular liners and they fit perfect in my 24 cupcake tin for my sour cream coffee cake muffins.  I also over filled and had plenty of room to place my crumb topping.

I love these for my muffins! They make them look so professional, they work well for a nice size muffin, the color is rustic and a hit with most people. The price on these is phenomenal makes it easy to rebuy when necessary.

Oh my goodness, these paper muffin liners are an absolute dream! Not only do they make every muffin and cupcake look like a delicate little treasure, but they also peel away so effortlessly. They keep everything tidy, no mess, no fuss—just perfect, darling muffins that pop right out. I can't stop gushing—seriously, these are a baker's best-kept secret!

These cupcake liners make my muffins and cupcakes look amazing! They are the perfect size and make them look like they’re from a bakery! They worked in a regular muffin pan too, I was scared because the liners are taller than regular liners

Elevate the look of your cupcakes and muffins by using these beautiful liners! They are the perfect size and are are of great quality!

These muffin liners work great. They don’t leak like paper liners and my muffins and cakes rise higher. They are extremely easy to remove. These are a keeper!

These really elevate my muffin game. I do spray them with some cooking spray but I haven’t had any problems with sticking. They are a great size and work great.

Comparing these to traditional pleated liners: these tulip liners get less crumbs stuck to them. A liner also contains the entire cupcake so it doesn’t flow over onto the pan, muffin-top style.

A good buy for people who bake regular sized cupcakes and muffins.

Love these liners! They are very nonstick and great quality. I used them to line pans making blueberry cupcakes. They are difficult to use to add batter and frost however, but if you’re patient you get the hang of it no problem. They do form in a funky way to your cupcakes with a bit of a crease but I didn’t mind that at all. Definitely purchasing again! Highly recommend

These cupcake liners are a step above regular cupcake pan liners. They dress up the look of a simple cupcake.

My muffins dont stick at all.

I love these! I can skip the greasing and whatever I cook in them pops right out.

I didn't expect to have such a strong response to muffin liners - yet here we are! These are beautiful quality, they're thick enough that the bottom of your muffin/cupcake doesn't get that dark base that happens with cheap muffin liners. Also, they make your home baked goods look like they came from a bakery! I swear I can fill them higher too, and my family is thrilled about the larger size. Recommend 10/10

The cupcakes look professionally made.  They arrived in good condition - the tips of the cupcake holders weren’t all bent. I’d definitely buy them again.

Met Expectations

These worked great for my zucchini chocolate muffins.  I used 2 really old 6 muffin tins that you have to watch over filling.  With these parchment muffin cups I was able to put a little more batter in each cup and to my amazement they raised higher, took a little longer to cook, but I didn’t have extra batter left over like usual.  I also like better than the Aluminum ones I always use.  The muffins released easy from these cups so I could freeze.

These liners are made out of parchment-like paper. Nothing stick to them. It makes my muffins look like bakery quality,

I doubled these up for Standard size, frosted carrot muffins and they were Really perfect. Made it so easy to transfer from pans to plates and from plates to take away cups if people wanted to take them home.

Fantastic and beautiful! Looks like a bakery

I have purchased these at least 3 times. They are fantastic and they have been better than any other brand I have tried. I only order these now! And everyone complements the color and the design. They keep grease down and if there is any splatter when filling they clean up really well after they are baked.

These make my blueberry muffins elegant and no cleanup!

We like parchment paper and the idea of a gourmet bakery look for muffins and cupcakes

These are so cute!!! I have a tendency to put too much batter into the muffin tins. These liners prevent them from spilling over into the bottom of the oven! Love! Even when you eat the baked good it’s nice because the liner will unfold so you’re not spilling crumbs everywhere. My muffins didn’t stick to the liners at all! However, now that I see how they’re folded I might just fold regular squares of parchment paper. But, of the sake of convenience these are awesome!

These were perfect and I will definitely order more for special occasions! Color stayed and they weren’t greasy. They held up through transport and looked great. I will also say decorating inside the liner was extremely easy too!

Great product, speedy delivery.

I used these for muffins last week and they really turned out perfect. I’m so glad I switched to these.

These are so nice- makes morning muffins look like they came from a fancy bakery!  Packaged well and easy to use!

This item appears and performs as described. Wish I had bought them sooner.

Love these liners. Do not need to use any sprays

These liners work wonders as they give added aesthetics to my muffins.  The best part, when Thoroughly baked, the muffins do not stick to the liners!

I love how professional these make my muffins look. I will continue to buy them over and over. They make me feel like I’m eating from a bakery and not my kitchen.

I appreciate that they keep your batter rising up and not spreading out over the pan.

Love these! They are perfect for my bakery!

Used for cupcakes for a large wedding!  They were a big hit!!

Love it! Quick and easy clean up!

When I saw the one box at my door after ordering (2) of the six roll packages I said no way…Amazon must have forgotten one of the six packs.  Wrong.  All 12 rolls were in this small box!  These are the smallest paper towel rolls I’ve ever seen.  And the fact that the packs say “6=12” is laughable.  Don't be fooled by the price…not worth it. Not to mention that the quality of the towels themselves….light, flimsy.  Never again. The Amazon brand is shockingly above and beyond the quality of these Scott ones.

They are a little tougher than the No Name store brands, but just about as thin. Humidity will almost saturate these things. They are rolled incredibly loosely, so they look really sloppy on the roll, but they probably did that to make it look bigger. You will go through these fast! These are not a bargain at any price. They are also not individually wrapped, which I didn't realize.

I was not expecting the role of paper towels to be so cheaply made and be so thin that when you try to rip off one sheet, she tears in pieces, I will not buy another roll of paper towels ever again I’ll pay the extra money to get bounty as these are not absorbent and they’re very cheap. very dissatisfied

If i could do zero stars i would. These are the absolute worst paper towels I have ever used. You have to use Half an entire roll just for one tiny spill and the floor still stays wet. These paper towels somehow create more liquid than what mess you are cleaning up.

These paper towels are about as thick as a grocery store reciept, and about as absorbent as a USA Today.Be careful, if you have this product on your "subscribe and save" list, this greedy company will raise the price 50% on this product when you aren't looking. Will no longer purchase.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Would not recommend, these are super thin and flimsy and do not absorb much at all. They fall apart and tear super easily. I do not understand how these are "double" rolls because they are much thinner than a regular roll of paper towels. I regret buying these, they are essentially rough, thin tissues.

These are very thin and cheaply made. You have to use double the amount of normal paper towels. Spend the extra money for a paper towel that will do the job far better than the whole roll of this stuff

These are thin they don't tear easy the glue holding the first sheet is to strong you have to tear into the paper towels to even get it to start. never had paper towels this bad in my life.

Packaging says 6 rolls = 12. All 6 rolls combined don’t equal one large roll. Each roll is extremely small,  you’ll go through a roll in half a day. Save your money and buy a different brand.

I’ve come to realize none of the Scott products are worth purchasing. Quality is absolutely terrible. The single sheet papertowel and toilet paper is such a cheap quality. You’ll need multiple sheets to be able to appropriately use it. Never again.

The sheets are so thin they could pass for tissue paper. Why do big corporations assume their customers are stupid? Dishonestly produced. It’s not the same as the one you buy in the store. Size, less, too soft for a paper towel!

What a total disappointment.  NEVER seen such small rolls in my life.  I fit all 15 in a cabinet that seldom holds more than 9 double rolls.  Shipping box weighed more than the product.

Mega? Are you kidding me? Not even close. This couldn't even be considered a double roll with most brands. Each one is LESS THAN 50 square feet (47.6). That is smaller than the smallest roll of foil wrap. There is nothing mega about this.Regular, Double, Triple, Mega is the order of paper towel sizes.By comparison:Scott "mega" papertowels says it is 102 single ply sheets each.Viva is 141 sheets per roll (triple).Bounty mega is 180 double ply sheets.Bounty essentials mega is 104 sheets.Walmart (cheap) everyday brand (triple) is 165 sheetsSparkle double roll is 110 sheets, 2 plyBrawny double roll has 120 2 ply sheets per roll.So, by far, scott is the worst value, most ripoff! Not worth it!!I am filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.

The description says 6 rolls are equal to 12 rolls.  Absolutely not. These rolls are small. Two of these rolls are equal to one roll..I will not buy this again

I have been using & loving Scott paper towels for 20+ years so I decided to buy in bulk. These paper towels were like Dollar Store paper towels .

What I dislike about this product was the Odd odor. This is my first time ordering paper towels from Amazon because I usually get them from the store, but since I’ve been sick, I haven’t been able to get out to purchase goods That I’m unable to use due to the smell.

Not sure of they have such a high rating. They are the thinnest paper towel I’ve ever used and am so mad I purchased them. I think maybe 3 of these are the thickness of most other paper towel brands! Don’t waste your money on them.

in the photo, they were said to be double-size rolls.  They could not possibly have been any smaller, without looking like the end of a roll.  As is, they look like half-used rolls when you open the package.  Not good PR for Amazon.  I usually look for the best values to be near the top of your listings.  These were not!

These are the worst paper towels I have ever bought in my life, they’re single Sheet, they say they’re double rolls, they are not, they are just a waste of paper, I feel sorry for the tree. Do not buy these! Horrible

Hear me out. If you came here to buy this instead of the generic one from that place that rhymes with lostco…it is nowhere close to the same. Save your money and go pick up the lostco one again instead.

Attempting to cut costs, I decided to go with this brand. However, I did not anticipate or (I guess) pay attention to the fact that these were 1 ply and nothing to compare with the more expensive Bounty that I had last time. So, lesson learned. They aren't terrible, but they don't last long and you have to use more of them to clean or wipe or dry and basically have to purchase more in a shorter amount of time than you would the thicker ply and larger rolls. So, that's my experience.

These paper towels are so flimsy even if you use six or seven of them to wash a glass they break through they are terrible.

I bought these to stock my short term rental because they were on sale.  They feel like third world paper towels; stiff, thin, and all round cheap looking.  Looks like something you'd get at the dollar store.

So thin you have to double to use most of the time.  Better to spend a little more and buy heavier weight.

I would never have bought this if i saw it in real life. incredibly stingy and bad value. do not recommend

Avoid this product. Paper towels are so thin you can hardly tear one off the roll without tearing the paper towel into pieces too small to use. Advertised as a double roll, but it is smaller than most brands regular size roll. Even the paper towels you buy from Dollar Tree are better quality and bigger rolls than Scott brand!

I didn't realize that there is now information about if they are 1 ply or 2 ply. Way too thin.

They are thin and you go through a roll in a day. Not Bounty or Braun I don't remember which I use. But save your money I would not purchase it again.

Don’t like these paper towels. The rolls are very small and the texture is extremely rough. Won’t buy them again.

The paper towels were all smashed when they arrived.  The rolls are dented and the tubes are smashed and they won't roll on the paper towel dispenser.  Won't buy again.

This paper math is not an easy thing, 6 told equals 24 old rolls, etc, but this paper towel has taken it to far.  Larger double rolls...?  No way.  Two of these rolls in one might be handy, but it's not width the time to put it on the roller in the kitchen.

I can't believe Scott name is on this product. They are worse than store brand. You need 3 or 4 to get the job done. Don't buy they are junk!

This is not like a double roll at all!! It’s tiny! I feel like I’ve been catfished !

Smallest roll of paper towels I have ever seen.  Doesn't even seem like a full single roll.

1.  Unknown substance of black material spotted throughout the rolls of paper towel on every roll.  I had to throw out a lot of sheets of paper with these defects.2.  Product is advertised as being equivalent to a double roll of paper towel.  However, they are very small.  I measured the diameter and it is the same diameter as a regular size of generic toilet paper.

No wonder it was so cheap! There’s hardly anything there! A few more bucks for a lot more!

This towel is not worth the money. I have to use twice the amount just to wipe the counter or my hands. Scott had loss me as a customer.

These are some very small rolls of toweling. Look like secondsVery disappointed.Will not purchase again.

Awful have to use 3-4 towels to make up what you would use for one normally

Super thin and see through. These dont clean or absorb well. I wont buy again.

"Double roll"? Yeah, maybe for a Hobbit. These paper towel double rolls are thinner than my dog's arm, and he's a wiener dog. Also, Scott must've had his three-year-old daughter superglue the pieces of paper towel together for you, so that's cute.Don't buy this crap. It's all lies.Their toilet paper is fine bc it's for your butt. All of Scott's products should be for butts.

The rolls are binded together so they rip when you pull them out of the package. The actual towels are very thin and have a scrolled pattern on them to have more space inbetween each touching sheet. They are very loosely packed and the roll is fairly small to begin with. Everything bleeds through them.You may be tempted to buy these because of the price, just don't.

I do not know what definition of double rolls means to some, but my definition is two regular rolls, rolled into one. These rolls are less than the average single rolls. Will not purchase this product from this website again.

I guess I'm used to buying paper towels that say double rolls 6=12 and actually look double rolls. These look like Dollar Tree paper towel rolls.

This paper tower is super thin and small roll, not worth the money

These are not double rolls, and don't compare to other Scott Paper towels.

Disappointed with the size.  Definitely doesn’t seem like a double roll.

Super thin, non-absorbent, worst paper towels ever. Splurge and get something else.

Small rolls. Paper is cheap and lower grade. Will not order again. You get what you pay for!  Going back to Bounty!!

These look like single rolls. Very small. They seem lesser quality than what I can buy at the store. I won’t buy again.

Okay, so “Scott” is a brand, right? It’s not like I’m getting the Walmart generic, this is actually a real brand! But oh you wouldn’t know it by the quality! The paper is thin and the roll feels loose, like it looks like a roll of paper but because it’s not tightly wound you’re not getting as much paper… and it’s this looseness that leads to the tube sliding out (see photo I posted), which totally sets off my OCD.I only got it because it was on special (usually get Bounty, which does not have this issue), this brand is definitely lower quality than Bounty.

I received my package of six “double” rolls paper towels a few days ago. When I opened them, I had to double check that I had ordered the double rolls. I had. The package also stated that they were double rolls.I showed my husband one roll and asked him if it was a single or a double. He said- single, and a paltry single. Like you might get at Dollar Tree. This will be the one and only time I order this product.

I decided to give the paper towels a try since we are very happy with the toilet papers from this brand. However, it didn't quite live up to the hype. Here is my take on why they deserve 2 stars:1. The paper is disappointing thin and you need at least 4 roll to have a decent absorbency to get the job done. They are good only for small mess and quick clean ups.2. Despite being advertised as superior, these paper towels are not better than standard rolls. They don't hold up well to tougher cleaning tasks and tend to fall apart quickly when wet.

I decided to try these because of the price but actually you wind up using three times as more towels because they are very thin. The material is also rough, but not absorbent . Also, the way they are packaged, looks like it's toilet paper. I thought I was ordering toilet paper as well. I would not buy these again.

If you are looking for heavy duty paper towels these are not it. The roll doesn’t contain much paper on them and they are extremely thin. I like the ripples in the paper but for my toddler mess I have to use a few instead of one to get the job done

The media could not be loaded.
                



To start off, I’ll say we love Scott Paper Towels! So this review isn’t about the paper towels themselves. I will NEVER order this, or anything remotely like it again. We felt the paper towel rolls were very small. They seem like single size rolls to be honest. That was $31 for 30 rolls that measure 4” across. What was more upsetting was all the packaging and boxing it took to get these to our house. Both of the packs of 15 rolls were individually wrapped in their own plastic. Those plastic packages were then placed in their own Scott Paper Towels box. Then that whole box was placed in another very oversized cardboard box. Practically embarrassed that we fell for that! Shame. Shame. Shame.

These are positioned as double rolls with a 15-pack equal to 30 regular rolls. This is impossible, they are the smallest rolls of paper towels I have ever seen! To suggest they are double the size of a regular roll of towels is simply impossible! What seemed like a good or at least fair price turns out to be a scam!  Picture is the Scott “double” roll next to the Bounty triple roll. As you can see it’s tiny and hardly even a single roll.

These are decent paper towels for the price, but they are 1 ply paper towels which makes them not quite as absorbent as other two ply paper towels. I have to use more towels to get the job done. I will be going back to Amazon Basics two ply paper towels after these run out.

These towels are thin and not very absorbent. I tried them because they were inexpensive, but because they perform poorly, they actually cost more than one of the better 2-ply brands where the ply's aren't so darn thin. I won't be buying these again.

It does its job but I can see that the quality is inferior than Bounty for example which is what I used in the past. Sure this is cheaper and it will get the job done but even when I try to take off one sheet, it tears apart, so the comments about it not ripping are just lies. They seem thinner and weaker than the brand I mentioned above.

My regular towels were not available so I ordered these. They are half the size of the other ones and I don’t think worth the price point. Cheap. I shop around a lot so I compare a lot! Making that dollar stretch!

These are not double rolls when compared to other brands. Completely mislabeled or incorrect advertising. One of these rolls is comparable most other brand rolls. Basically, you are buying three rolls. Not recommended!

...I went through these FAR FASTER than Bounty. For normal cleanup jobs, I had to use 3-5 sheets, whereas Bounty I would use one or two at most. I won't be buying these again.

Very misleading marketing. In no way does these equal 60 Regular Rolls, in fact they are rather small and at the most the size of a regular roll.

These paper towels are thinner than expected and don't absorb well. I find myself using more sheets than I would with other brands, so it doesn’t feel like a good value.

They got an extra star for their low price. They don't absorb well at all. We went through them faster than any paper towel before.

Happy with the price of these paper towel rolls, the actual strength and thickness of the paper towel is lacking though.

I was very disappointed in the size of the rolls. They go quickly in 2 weeks I've used half the package already

Not bad, but not great either. They aren't double rolls; barely regular rolls. I won't buy these again.

Don’t be cheap and buy these, I know that little 7/8$ looks good but in the end the real deal paper towels is what you want, unless you want to use half the roll to wipe up a water ring on your table. Go ahead and spend some money on a better brand or grab you a towel out the bathroom

These paper towels are nothing like the brand TP they produce. The first batch of 6 was very thin and stuck to each other. The 2nd set of paper towels was decent thickness-wise but stuck to each other badly.I don't want to have to separate rolls from each other just to grab a roll.Never again.

These paper towels are too thin.  I won’t buy them again. They’re not worth it!

Very weak, does not tear well. Went through a roll very quickly. Would not purchase again.

I don’t like these because I end up using double the quantity since they’re so thin! The thinnest Ive ever used was Trader Joe’s which is the equivalent to using one ply toilet paper at public restrooms. This is slightly better than that but if you want great quality go for Bounty or even Target brand

This is barely a single roll. Would not recommend or buy again based on description

These paper towel do not absorb anything. Rolls are thin which would be fine if it did it's job. I have to use several sheets just to wipe up a spill. When cleaning my mirrors it just falls apart. I do not recommend buying these. Spend a little extra on something more absorbant.

Liked the price ...u get what u pay for. Rips terribly, is vy annoying.

What can I say, you get what you pay for.  Don’t expect these to be high grade.  The best thing about them is the price.  Almost no absorption.

Thought that I would try these. Bad move. Too small sections. Poor wet strength.

This product is below average.  The rolls are small.  The sheets are thin so you are going to use more sheets  than normal.  Will not buy again.

Love Scott’s paper towels but these are not double rolls as advertised.

more shrinkflation for sure, these are thin and rip very easily.

Tried these over our usual purchase of Bounty. These were just so thin, had to use several to clean up messes. We still prefer Bounty.

The paper towels were sticking together  like siamese  twins. When trying to pull apart paper was wasted.  It was like glued together

I just got these and like other reviews say  they are def not double rolls never again Scott

The rolls get smaller with each new order -- these double rolls are probably smaller than the original single rolls were years ago.  It doesn't really matter if they're soft or absorbent when they're so small.  Much better off to go with an off brand for quantity because there is no value here.

Please do yourself a favor and go buy Aldi’s brand paper towels, these suck.

You know I've got too much time on my hands when I can say, "I'm profoundly disappointed in the quality of these paper towels." I mean, how bad can they be? And who's got time to get worked up about paper towels?  Well, I do.  If we're measuring on the scale of "cheap paper towels from the dollar store," these are at the top of THAT scale.  But, I ordered Scott Towels. When I was a kid, Scott Towels was one of THE name brands (along with Bounty and Viva). You paid a little more, but got a quality paper towel, one with some durability, some absorbancy, some heft. These Scott Towels have none of that. They feel flimsy, the choose-a-size sheets actually feel smaller than others similar sheets from other brands, and it takes nearly twice the number of sheets to absorb what Bounty, or Brawny, or Viva, or even BJ Wholesale Club's house brand absorb.  Sure, the price was decent (when I bought them), but the rolls are even smaller than you imagined they would be, and with the minimal absorbancy, you're using more than you thought you would.  I'll give these towels two-stars because they actually do some absorbing; they just don't do nearly enough.  There are far better choices out there than these.

6=12 is not true...more like 6=6 rolls from the DollarStore....These are like recycled paper towels. They put a lot of glue on each roll, so they're stuck together.

Was not strong at all. Had to use a lot to dry hands. Not suited for cleaning up spills or cleaning anything. The texture just too thin

Thought I would try a cheaper alternative to bounty paper towels and that is exactly what I got these were 6 packs all stuck together so when you pulled them apart you lost about 6 sheets right away from ripping they are very thin. They say you get what you pay well you do don’t waste your money on these cheap paper towels they are garbage

If you are looking for soft paper.towels.then these are not the ones you want to purchase. There isn't much on the roll either. Won't purchase again.

Thin, small rolls. So thin I can almost read through it. It is absorbant  - but these thin sheets do not absorb much...

I was under the impression that these paper towels were absorbent but they definitely aren’t. I’d definitely stick to other brands. Not worth it

Updated: One thing I did not anticipate with these thin towels is how fast the capillary action would be no matter how many times you folded them.  You see, using any other towel, even generic grocery brands.  I have probably 100s of times taken a folded up full sheet paper towel and wiped a minimal amount of oil out of a still hot frying pan while holding it off of the cook-top surface.  In the past (100s of times)  folding 4 or more times insulated my skin from the heat, and I could essentially wipe it clean in quick fashion.  However, with these towels, they are so thin the instant I touched the pan, scalding hot oil wicked through the ultra thin fabric and burned my fingers before I even started wiping.Original Title: Seemed like alot for the money, not so sure it's a bargainThey are really really thin and the rolls are smaller.  But they do the job.  Perhaps I was using too much material with premium brands.  As long as you only want the minimum requirement these are ok.  Otherwise expect disappointment.

Not double rolls. Smaller than a normal sized roll.

These are half size rolls not double size .

Ordered them for my Dad, but he didn’t like them much. He said the paper towel was on the small side.

But still worked regardless of the damage they were clearly dried after absorbing something so they still worked just kind of discolored

If these are DOUBLE rolls, I’d hate to see what regular rolls are! I don’t love these paper towels at all. They’re rough, which I guess would be great for cleaning because it will give a sort of scrubby vibe. But these are such wimpy little rolls and they just don’t last long. Not worth the money in my opinion. They are fairly strong, they don’t fall apart super easy, but if you’re looking for true DOUBLE rolls, these aren’t it. As much as I don’t need an entire case of Costco Kirkland paper towels and it would take us 15 years to go through them, after using those, it’s really hard to switch back to chintzy little rolls like these. No thank you. I won’t be buying these again. Not to mention, if you have any texture aversions at all, these are TERRIBLE!!! They hit all my textural icks and I hate using these. I’ll use them up, of course, don’t get me wrong. But I’m going to hate every single sheet along the way. NEXT!!!!

Bought it on sale + found an open box purchase which made these a really good value, only to find that the package had been opened and someone removed several rolls and I guess they delivered it to me! Fortunately Amazon seems to have accepted the return without hassle..On the product itself, I would consider it mid-grade, not a bad deal but actually sheet for sheet I think Kirkland's brand from Costco is a better value + higher quality.

Scott brand makes good paper towel that's often priced a little better than the other brands. Economics are very important, especially these days.  These are often better at cleaning up spills than the generic or Discount Store brands. You get what you pay for with paper towel products and we often choose this brand as we know what to expect.  I hope you and your family are well and hope this little review was somehow helpful. These are good for Kitchen, Garage and Vehicles!

Ehhh, not a fan of scott products. I thought I would give this paper towel a try. If this is a double roll Id hate to see what a single roll looks like.  Im going back to bounty once I go through this six pack.  No thumbs up, if youre a scott brand person, my apologies It just doesnt make sense for the price.

Great price and they work fine, but the “double roll” is a joke. I normally get the Amazon brand and their roll size is much bigger, what I would consider an average size. Can’t share a picture as I’m out of the Amazon brand, thus ordering these in a pinch.

I forgot how thin this brand of paper towel is when purchasing. It was very affordable, but I ended up having to use twice as much to get the same result as other brands. In the long run, not worth saving a few bucks.

I don't understand the positive reviews of this paper towel?  Maybe everyone else received something else because my "double" rolls were tiny and they are single ply which is a joke.  I was not impressed.

The description claim they were double rolls. They definitely were not, all single roles. But I do like it because it’s a brand  name. I just think the description needs to be corrected.

This is much smaller than the standard size paper towel roll I am used to getting. I would most definitely not advertise as a double roll. It’s just “normal” if anything.

I bought these on a special-can’t find what I paid. But I looked them up and they are now $31 for 30 rolls. I use these for basic household tasks, but I paint with oil and they are the perfect texture and consistency to wipe my brushes, etc. However, these are NOT double rolls. They are barely single rolls. The roll runs out faster than any other paper towel I’ve used.I caught a bargain, but if you want real value, these are extremely strong and the rolls are tiny. Buy something else.

What happened to Scott paper towels? These use to be my go-to, but there is no way this is a double roll. Let alone they are flimsy now.

I should of looked closer.  These are small rolls.  They are better than cheap paper towels but not my favorite.  Won’t buy sgain.

I don't like these at all. The roll goes quicker than our usual, and the absorbing power is less efficacious.Definitely not one to repurchase.

Good price ,paper towels seem to shred off little pieces when wiping or to damp..did not care for that..Good in a pinch..

Purchased as it was a great price, but it is very thin. Goi g back to bounty

Rough. Thin. Non absorbent. You’re better off using the cheap paper towels at the gas pump.

The rolls are a bit thin but I like the no-dye versions and select-a-size.

Decently soft, but quite thin and not very strong or durable.

These are smaller than a regular size roll. Says 100 sheets but they are one ply. A regular bounty roll is 108 sheets and is almost two inches in diameter larger as they are 2 ply. The 2 ply will absorb much more and therefor you will use less paper towels.

Each roll is half size loopof the regular roll!

They kinda push liquid around instead of absorbing.

Sheets are a little to small

So I bought this brand in March, 30 rolls, and it was amazing. They discontinued that specific order and now I see why. They increased the price and made them smaller. Compare the reduction! It's a good paper towel, and I love that it's bulk, but this reduction feels deceitful.

Too thin, picks up nothing. Waste of money

These are single ply paper towels

This would have been a decent buy if they were truly double rolls as advertised but they are definitely not a double roll compared to almost any other brand of paper towels.  Will not be purchasing again.

Of course they're paper towels. Just didn't live up to my expectations. I still love my Costco paper towels & was looking to replace them as I have to now drive two hours to get to Costco.

They're alright paper towels. Every roll was really hard to get the first sheet unstuck. They didn't last very long since I had to use multiple for the smallest amount of liquid. I probably won't buy them again.

I found a grocery store brand for a dollar more a two extra rolls, that works twice as good as these towels. Basically, these towels are not good. They don't suck up fluids, they just suck.

These are advertised as double rolls but are less than half the size of brawny and bounty double rolls. I guess you get what you pay for , single rolls.

These rolls are terribly small I'm comparing them to a Target brand triple roll however even a Target brand regular roll is bigger than these they're very rough I haven't used them to pick up any messages yet but we'll see just got them to have a few on the side for pet cleanups I'll update this after that but honestly doubtful I'll be buying these again I would rather get six triple rolls for $12 then waste my money on this also when you first open them it is extremely hard to get them open without ripping them the glue is so strong

We felt the texture was weird and ply was thin. They didn't do the best at soaking up liquid, so multiple would be needed for one task. But they didn't shred.

I really don’t like these- they are too thin. They have grooves for picking up spills but I find I need to use more. I wouldn’t buy them again.

Good towels overall, though I would try them. However I they are not the best ones that I have used and they tend to be a bit rough. Overall though it is an ok product.

They aren't good. But they are cheap! We have pets and kids so we use paper towels often. So we buy these because they are cheap

The rolls are so small now.  You get 6 in a pack that equals to 2packs.  So so small🤢

If you think public restroom toilet paper is luxurious then these Double Rolls are huge! Or for a better visual maybe if you are at that place that has everything priced at the same amount, they might get the status of double roll. lol, they are at best single roll size and that is being generous. for a few dollars more buy the name brands.  they work but they are not something special.

These are okay for the price, but as far as paper towels go, they are mediocre. Very thin and don't tear off the roll too well. You pretty much need to use a full sheet vs half. With a better quality paper towel, half a sheet does a great job, however for these, a full sheet is typically needed. I'd still purchase them due to the value & for certain things like drying hands, but not for cleaning much except maybe to daily clean the mirrors or something.

These are definately better than generic paper towels and serve the purpose. I found them to be a little on the thin side and the rolls are 50 sheets smaller than the Members Mark brand I get from Sams Club. If you need paper towels and you can't get to Sams, these will do and ship fast through Amazon Prime. I would buy them again if I absolutely had too, but if you want the paper towels for a much better price, then get these: Member's Mark Select & Tear 2-Ply Paper Towels 150 sheets/roll, 15 rolls 19.98

I thought the rolls were supposed to be bigger i would have bought a different package.

It was thinner than I thought' it works, but you have to use more than one sheet!

Scott is not my favorite brand of paper towels but they do the job

Could've been thicker, and more sheets, but it'll do in a pinch.

I buy these all the time at local store. The package looks just like this. I thought I would go ahead and order because I was out of paper towels and i couldn't get to store. My paper towel holder in picture shows that I was correct. When I buy these at store a roll barely has any room. You can see in photo there is a lot of leftover space with these rolls. I will stick to buying in store instead of these.  Th quality of them seems different also. So I'm not sure what the deal is with these.

Like other reviewers have mentioned.  These rolls are so small.  There is no way they are 6 "double rolls" equal 12 regular rolls.  These are smaller than regular rolls.  Luckily I have a Costco and Sams membership.  I guess I need to make a trip.  These are going to go fast the rolls are so small. Do not buy these!  There is a reason the price is so cheap. You get what you pay for.

Supposedly double rolls, but are less than half the size of Bounty.

Very low quality which is not double and doesn't last very long

These paper towels are alright. But they are rather thin.

Very skimpy on the amt of paper on rolls.

Seams like the packaging is getting smaller every time I order these.

Works well enough. Priced about a dollar per roll so I shouldn't complain! Not very durable or thick but good bang for your buck.

I tend to have 2 types of paper napkins, maybe it’s my OCD or maybe just my allergies but I like to have some napkins that last longer and wont cost a fortune. Whether it’s the dog slobbering all over or cleaning up small messes, or using some to blow my nose, I like Scott’s napkins because they aren’t so soft and fall apart quickly.  They are a bit on the thinner side but the size of the perforated cut makes it easier to just use twice as much and doesn’t feel like you’re running through he role quickly so it’s a go-to brand for us.

The waffle texture made these one ply sheets fine to use for simple uses, ie, light spills or for napkins etc., but they aren't heavy duty.  I actually also bought Sparkle brand to compare.  Both had 6 rolls.  This Scott's brand  cost $6.84 for 6 rolls, and 6 rolls of Sparkle was $7.28 total .  I weighed a roll of each.  The Scott's brand roll weighed 5.4 oz and the Sparkle brand roll weighed 7.9 oz.  which is almost 50% more per roll!  So basically, for about 10 cents more per roll, you'll get 50% more when buying the Sparkle brand, so I favor the Sparkle brand.  Obviously you can tell I like to bargain hunt.  Still, this Scott's brand at $6.84, is a fair price for 6 rolls.

For 6 bucks you can't go wrong.  But, the rolls are small and the paper is not that soft.  I don't want soft paper so that's not an issue for me.  Only 6 bucks. I bought 2

These are smaller rolls, they don’t last as long as some of the larger rolls. I like that they don’t leave lint behind when I am drying my pump parts and the baby bottles.

I like Scott products and these are no exception but the rolls are smaller then the ones you would get from target, Walmart, Wegmans (google wegmans if you have never heard of it and prepare for your mind to be blown)

With all the other brands being so expensive this is the best deal yet. You do have to use a few squares when pretty much doing anything but there’s so much of it that you get that it lasts a long time. I’m a mother of 4 and this is what I use to save and get the most for my money. Not the softest but not hard either.

good towels to clean up a mess

For the price is okay I recommend  if you have small family

These rolls were smaller than expected. But for the price they were pretty good quality.

Had no problems with it. It worked well.

I feel kinda clean.

I recently purchased the Scott Paper Towels, and I must say they are a solid choice for everyday use. The absorbency is quite impressive; they handle spills and messes efficiently without falling apart. The durability is also notable, allowing for some scrubbing without disintegrating.What I particularly appreciate is the roll size, which lasts longer than many other brands I've tried. It's also cost-effective, offering good value for the quantity you receive. The texture is just right—not too rough, making it gentle on hands and surfaces.However, the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the paper towels are not as soft as some premium brands. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me, it might be for those who prefer a softer touch.Overall, Scott Paper Towels are reliable, durable, and economical, making them a great choice for everyday cleaning needs. Highly recommended!

These paper towels seem to be of medium quality. They are definitely not the worst ones I have ever purchased, nor are they the best. However, these are great for every day use for small spills, use for husbands lunches and so on. Good quality….Great price….Happy Customer!  ♥️

When I took these out of the box I was surprised with the actual size of the paper towel rolls themselves, they seem a little small. My current paper towel being used is a different brand and it was a huge roll when I first got it, while these rolls brand new are the same size as this half-used roll from a different brand. Haven't actually used them yet but I was a little disappointed

If you are a light paper towel user, this will work well for you.

Like the select-a-size price and texture the paper towels have

It not upto bounty standard. But its more than good enough for its price. Less than half the price of bounty so worth it.

THIS PACK LASTED ME A MONTH. GREAT VALUE

I like that this is a pick a sheet perforated size. Less waste.

Affordable and sturdy

Small paper towels.  Did not last as long.

As compared to Amazon's paper towels, they are about equal.  I haven't yet decided which I would purchase again, though I tend to lean to Amazon's, as it seems they are just a tiny tad sturdier.  I have yet to use them side by side to see.

These Scott towels work as expected, even i preffer little softer towels.

They’re paper towels - towels made of paper on a roll with towels made of paper that use like… well like towels

Leaves glass lint free

It’s not seem to be much product per roll

Best towels ever

For the price I’m really happy with these paper towels.  I think consumers are brainwashed that a 2-3 ply paper towel is necessary which isn’t normally the case for most of what I use them for.

These work okay in terms of absorbing, but they are not very big rolls. They have a rough texture and are kind of hard to start a new roll. The first paper towel per roll ends up being shredded in pieces usually.

They are normal paper towels. Good price

These remind me of their "comfort" toilet paper. It's a decent paper towel but the roll size is pretty small considering it's suppose to be a 6= 12 roll size. It's pretty durable and the texture on the sheets is nice.

I've come to expect high quality from any Scott product, and these paper towels don't disappoint. I've dropped one star because the "double roll" claim appears no larger than a typical single roll purchase. Compared to Amazon's double roll paper towels, the Scott brand is about half the roll size.

Good quality but small rolls. I should have checked the fine print. I like the larger roll.

Patterned like Cottonelle toilet paper. Easy to tear with even edges unlike some other brands. Disappointed in roll size and on the thin side sheets.

Not as absorbant as other products. Quality is fair.Not smooth texture.Didn't notice any smells.

Priced right and durable.

Okay

Providing more absorbency, but not as effective as 2-ply alternatives

Use these all the time.

I had never used this paper towel before. It is very absorbent and does a great job!

Absorption is great. Thicker towel. Great price at the time I bought them.

I like the brand Scott and it’s what I grew up using in my childhood home. My dad always called our paper towels Scott Towels no matter what brand my mom was buying. lol. They might have been the first one on the market but I don’t usually buy this brand anymore because I get the big ones from Costco and they’re usually bounty and charmin over there, but if I’m not feeling up to that I order these ones from Amazon and although they’re smaller rolls they still work great and I don’t have any complaints about them. It’s Scott to me and they are always a good backup to have on hand. I’ve never been disappointed with them..

Didn't realize how thin the sheets were on these paper towels. One half sheet is okay for a napkin barely. Scott products used to be top of the line. Not anymore.

Good quality great price!!

Great for the price and quantity

These works good and for the price I can’t complain

This paper towel is sturdy and very absorbent!  Great price for a good product!

These work fine as long as you know they are cheap paper towels that aren't cloth-like at all. They tear apart fairly easily when they are wet but you should expect that for this price. If you expect very cheap paper towels to be like super expensive Brawny ones then you need to readjust your unrealistic expectations. These work fine for basic paper towel usage cleaning up small messes and liquid spills.

It is soft. Doesn't always tear because some tear points aren't cut good.

🙂 Thank you - I appreciate this paper product🧻 even if it's Not my most preferred brand of paper towels. Not the best commercial brand of paper towels for drying purposes but I actually prefer this paper product for alternate uses -🔘  disposable dinner napkins🔘  like facial tissues for quick cosmetic make-up removal🔘  like hygienic facial tissues 🤧🔘  to de-grease greasy plates, pots, pans, and containers before using a soapy 🧽 sponge for dishwashing by hands🔘 container liners to absorb moisture and to absorb food grease🔘 to wrap certain foods to keep them dry and to keep from getting soggy in the fridge.Overall this is a brand of paper towels 🧻that is a good value for its alternate uses 😁

These last a while and it's a great price for the quantity. These papers towels are sturdy and clean messes well. I will continue to order.

The Scott tissue & towels package size was great, it was what I wanted. Because the delivery person followed my instructions, it was so easy for me to get the total package inside the house. I did not have to wrestle with steep front porch steps. So far the iPhone charger is working and is long enough for my needs. I haven’t used the other ordered items yet, but I will sing their praises if they meet my expectations.

I don't have to find room for them in my car and they are delivered to my door-well worth it for me

We will not buy another brand. We are always happy with this brand and the price point works for our budget. The quality to us is unmatched, and I like the short sheets so we don’t use a full sheet.  Very happy with this brand. Thanks

Took a while to find the cheapest. Amazon may be the cheapest, so far. Arrived quickly, picks up spills quickly, absorb liquids, spills quickly. Nice and smooth. I find myself using them for everything. I order double bulk. They last a good amount of time. 2nd time or third ordering and I'm pleased.

Love this paper towel, quality and texture are great for cleaning up and absorbing all the grandkids messes. Repeat buying this item

Cheaper to but on amazon than in stores. The best paper towel brand as it soaks everything up without needing many squares.

I love the varying size sheets. I also like that they are only a double roll. Triple rolls are too tight on my holder. Scott quality is always good.

As a busy mom and professional, I need paper towels that can handle everything from kitchen spills to quick clean-ups. Scott Paper Towels, Choose-A-Sheet, 6 Double Rolls, have been a game-changer. They are incredibly absorbent and durable, making them perfect for any mess. Plus, the Choose-A-Sheet feature helps reduce waste. Highly recommend!

You can never go wrong with Scott Paper Towels. 6 Double Roll for a not so bad price for the 12 regular Rolls.  Will buy again and have bought again.

I go through alot of paper towels as I have several animals that tend to make a mess. Paper towels are my go to. And these are a bargain compared to the store prices.

My little Gussie, rescue cat loves to lie down on a sheet of brown paper and then several sheets of this paper towel on top then she falls right to sleep.  It's warm and comforting.  :)

With choose-A-sheet technology, you can control how much paper towel you use. It’s like having a superpower for cleaning, and let me tell you, that power comes with a lot of responsibility—mostly in the form of buying these paper towels in bulk. So why do I stock up on these? Because when my granny gives a recommendation to buy these, I listen. Plus, let’s face it: with all the spills and messes life throws at you, it’s better to have enough.

Pretty sure the rest of my life I’m gonna be buying paper towels

Don't go limp when wiping up liquid easy to tear smaller pieces off but strong for big cleanup good price

Good brand worth the money

Good price and quality for the price!

Didn't expect the thickness and absorbency to be that good from Scott's but they are terrific towels

Great to have for parties. Cleans it up .

Great price , fast shipping

Perfect towels for cleaning a mess and good cost.

Would recommend good quality

Scott towels convenient, quality and rough on spills.

Good Deal

In the future l will no longer purchase bulk size this way they have really reduced the amount per roll by 50 sheets .l will purchase from dollar stores where at least you get more for your money...goodbye Scott the box was too light that was the 1st clue..DONE

They’re paper towels

Very nice product

This is a great bargain ! The price is unmatched for the quality. I plan on stocking up on more

The softness are great the size are also good and the value for your money is excellent. The quality also is excellent.

Good quality and quantity for that price!!!

Made of paper, perforated, clean tearing sheets, could go on and on about it, but in the end it is a paper towel and this review is already too long.  It does what it is supposed to.  And could possibly be used for a few things it was not intended to do.  Check your local laws and restrictions for verification!

Best paper towel

I use it for clean up

Must Buy

Think enough

I received my order on 8/30/24 as expected. It was enough to share with my mom. Might I say it's a good brand of paper towel in my opinion. The price was not bad! I am able to restock for months and save. Will order more if sale still exist after my initial order😂😂 one can never have enough paper towel or toilet paper.

Great bargain.

Love these

I use the paper towels in my kitchen and bathroom.

Nice durable cleaning power and absorbancy

Fine

Great paper towels that are easy to rip apart and are soft and thick for comfortable wiping.

Viva has historically been a beloved household product and a favorite to use for personal care for elderly relative. However, the last few years this product has gone from being “signature soft cloth-like” to being “Paper Thin Pulp Rough-Like”. Kimberly Clark Corporation shame on you for taking advantage of consumers like this!  My elderly relative cried when they saw the horrendous quality of the “cloth” as they call it.We now resorted to using a competitor brand for household use, and specialty brand for personal care. So,Kimberly Clark; consider this my eulogy to your Viva brand and other products we so once used to use from you.Hasta La Viva Kimberly Clark products - we use your competition now ;)

They feel like sandpaper now! I have relied on these for years because of the significantly better softness and absorbency compared to any other brand. Well not anymore! They feel like sandpaper on your hands and nose. We used to use these in lieu of kleenex but now they rub your nose raw right away. And you need so many now to clean up a soil unlike before. Seems like there was a shortage during the pandemic, and then when they came back there was this new “formulation.” SO SAD!! Please bring back original soft VIVA!!

These paper towels are completely different than the original composition. These paper towels are thin and hardly soft. They are nothing like the original viva paper towels, viva claims they did not make any changes but it’s very clear that they have. I am one of many to notice this.

I always buy these from Walmart, they are smoothe and soft. THESE ones from Amazon have ridges and are rough and thin. Not sure why they are different, upset because I ordered a huge bulk box and they aren't the same.

These are not as durable as the original ones. They now have a wave pattern and easily tear apart when they get wet. Feels thinner than before.

We noticed right away, the towels are rough to the touch, nor cloth like at all. When you spend your hard earned money to buy something nice, and spend extra to get the good ones it sucks when a company takes advantage of you. Shame on this company. Especially in this economy.

Advertises Super roles but these are just normal size rolls.  Price is very high for normal size rolls. Not a good value at all compared to the normal high prices at the grocery store. Canceled subscription after first delivery when we saw the size of the roles.  Fool me once shame on you; Fool me twice shame on me.

I used to only use Viva paper towels, but my husband preferred Bounty. When they popped up on Amazon again, I wanted to try to win him over with these super soft, durable paper towels. Well wasn't I surprised that either they completely changed their product or these aren't real Viva brand. They aren't absorbent at all...they're IMPOSSIBLE to tear off a sheet with one hand .. they're not soft AT ALL anymore.. the rolls are tiny .. theyre way more expensive than competitors. Get your act together VIVA...So disappointed

Long time Viva Signature Cloth user and fan. These advertised Viva Signature Cloth towels are much thinner, rough, do not hold up when wet, breaks down and does not come close to what you can still purchase in the store.

There is a very strong unpleasant odor. I cannot use these towels especially in the presence of small children. I need a refund

Something seems to have changed. These have left a layer of lint on my kitchen counters and they seem thinner than before. I need several paper towels to pick up a mess and forget using them to clean the counters, as they leave behind a linty track.  They’re hard to pull off the roll and each time you take a towel, a cloud of lint flies in the air. I will not be buying these again.

This is NOT the real Viva signature cloth. That is all I use so I know the brand quite well. This is a FAKE.

The triple size Viva that we hav received the last two times is too diffuclt for an ill person to handle.  Need smaller size that I originally ordered and that I have received for about a year

Never used paper towels so awful. I don't get why anyone would want paper towels that stick to the roll every time you go to remove some. It's maddening and they leave little fuzzies on anything you try to wipe down with them. GAH 😫 Pass on these if you value your sanity.

These are not the same texture or quality as the ones I buy in the store.

I’ve been using Viva paper towels for 30 years - whatever I just received 24 rolls of isn’t it. It’s stiff and scratchy, not 2-ply as stated in the description, and are tiny rolls. Considering what I can buy 2-ply for elsewhere, I would have asked a friend to pick them up for me since I have a broken foot.

Unfortunately, these rolls are no longer the same as they used to be. They’re making them with less paper and you’re getting much less on each roll. Sucks bc these used to be some of the best around but now they’re ridiculously high priced for way less paper.

I have bought viva paper towels many times, and they are usually super soft like cloth.  The 4 packages I bought are not soft at all, but are very scratchy.  they don't seem like the real Viva paper towels.

I am floored. I found a looking, brown hair attached to some type of gunk on one of the rolls. I have been buying Viva for decades. I ahead never seen this. This makes me doubt where these came from since there, apparently,  was no quality control.

When I order Viva, I expected soft cotton cloud like the old way they were made.  Instead, these tiny rolls are non absorbent garbage.  There's no need to trademark or patent this blend.. really terrible.

These are the absolute worst! Paper towels should not require two hands to use them. I’m at the point of intentionally making messes so that I can get through these crap towels as quickly as possible.

These are not signature cloth. Something went wrong. The packaging reads signature cloth but the towels are different. I use the signature cloth every day for years. These are NOT those. They are thin and flimsy.

These paper towels were really good, years ago. Now, they don’t absorb anything. They stick together so that it is difficult to pull off the roll and they are rough. What a disappointment.

Might a well buy Bounty. I liked the softness now pay the higher price for rough trash towel.. they are disgusting!

Same quality viva paper towels but not the 24 super rolls like stated so that’s misleading.  We returned because we don’t like to be mislead.

Said super size and they are small rolls

I will not buy these again,cuz they leave lint behind,and not absorbent enough.

Quality has gotten so bad, feels like sandpaper!!

Looks like a great value, but:The rolls are rather small and go fast.  The texture is unpleasant.  The towels are not even very absorbent.

I am boycotting Amazon and Viva!  We’re not your sheep.  I own a forest.  I’ll make my own paper.  You are thieves!

They say "mega roll", but they're about half as big as the other brands' mega rolls. Very cheap material...seems like something you'd get at the Dollar Store

will be returning because they are not a full sheet. I want a full sheet viva paper towel, not the select-o-size or "task size"

Not worth saving the buck. Trust me ole son.

Paper thin 1 sheet does nothing

I was taken aback when I tried to wipe up a spill

Do NOT buy,

Too ruff

Very bad

Worst paper towel EVER! What happened? I have never used a paper towel this bad. This is the worst! It is very thin. Not absorbent. Try to clean glass. It just smears. It does not absorb. Big mistake buying this! Signature cloth? Ha! Thin paper garbage! You have been warned!

These used to be perfect, but they've added a ribbed texture that runs through the cloth now that's made it thinner and less absorbent. Feels lower quality than it used to be.

I haven't had this issue before, but the towels stink of marijuana. I mean really stink! My whole room smells now. I am super allergic and they are making my eyes itch. I am unhappy with this purchase.

Kimberly Clark has destroyed the best paper towel product on the market! I have paid a premium price for Viva for at least 20 years. The towels were SOFT, and absorbent. I could clean anything with  excellent results. NOT ANYMORE! They are rough enough to feel like sandpaper on my face. Sadly, I am returning my two $29 packs right away. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Kimberly Clark, you broke it.

I thought this was a good value until I received them talk about cheesy thin thin will not buy again I will stay with Bounty

Not the same classic cloth like product. Feels like every other brands regular cheap paper towels but marginally thicker. Does not hold up like the original material. Texture is different, much thinner, less durable, same price if not higher. Greedflation strikes again. Looking for a new brand.

I should have known the “deal” I found was too good to be true. Compared to other brands, these paper towels are very thin and not at all absorbent. You can feel the thinness even before you’re one sheet from the roll. I need to use twice as many of these to wipe up spills on the stove or counter as I did with another well-known brand. If I could return these, I would, but now I’m stuck with 23 more rolls of these. Spend an extra $4 for a better brand and save yourself the trouble.

Viva towels are the best and I have used them for years.  However, I just had to cancel my subscription because the regular towels are no longer available.  This triple size does not work for me.  They are way too bulky and will not fit a standard paper towels dispenser.  Not convenient for me.

I have used Viva for a couple of decades now. The last package - the same thing I always buy - isn't at all like what I used to get. Apparently Viva has chosen to take a cheaper route to make these. They were soft - now they are incredibly rough. I can no longer clean my glasses, computer screen, phone, or anything else that requires a soft cloth. They used to leave no lint behind. Now there is lint everywhere. I used them for makeup removal, but they are too rough, and leave lint behind on my face, which then gets in my eyes. Finally, now when these are removed from the roll it is common to have a chunk rip right out of the piece. It is clear that I have to switch brands. Actually, it's very clear that I can no longer use these and must actually move to fabric. OK. Cheaper in the long run for me anyway.

Ordered these twice and both times the paper towels were lower quality than the same Viva Signature Cloth that I buy in a store. The ones on Amazon are not as soft as the ones sold in stores. They are still decent at cleaning up spills, but just know you aren’t getting the same product.

I have used Viva towels for years without issue. The ends of these are oddly stuck to the roll, making it hard to start pulling the towels off. Never seen Viva towels like this. It's not sticky like there is an adhesive on it, it's more like the end was very compressed to the roll.

I just got my package of signature cloths and they are not like they use to be! They are not soft and durable anymore. They almost feel like regular rough paper towels.

They only received two not three packages.

I don’t like and won’t buy again. Towels are too soft and I need to use several to clean with or wipe up water. I’m sticking to Brawny paper towels are more durable.

Advertised as super rolls and not even close.. More like "mini" roles. I will not buy again and don't recommend you do either. Go to store and SEE what your buying.

Like tissue.

Not the same as regular signature! Rip off

I use to love these but in the recent ones I notice that the thickness is less and they fall apart more. I also see that they don't tear at the perforation and often tear at an angle. I feel it is like the issues noted with containers costing the same but having less product. I'm paying the same but getting less quality. If Viva doesn't go back to the old method I will no longer purchase.

I been using these for many years and live them

I buy Viva paper towels at CVS and these are NOT the same towels. These towels are less absorbent and scratchier feeling. Still better than a lot of paper towels but definitely not the real Viva. False advertising.

I was surprised that this product isn’t the same as I’ve bought in store.  This is labeled as their signature cloth like towel, but it’s thinner — like a knockoff.  Returned.  Will buy the real thing in store

I’m not entirely certain why this product is so vastly different than other paper towel products but if you’re planning on cleaning something which you do not want towel residue left behind on then go for another product. This creates an entirely different mess than that which you may have started with. No bueno. 👎🏼

Went back to Bounty as I use 1/2 the towels per roll - with these I had to use 2-3 vs. 1 Bounty sheet.

These new towels from VIVA have a rough side and they tried to make a smooth side but it doesn’t work. The originals were strong and soft at the same time and I have used them since they began offering them which is over 20 years but now I will have to stop using them because they are too rough for my face and my hands. I am not using paper towels to clean my house and floor and walls with. I use my paper towels to dry my hands and dry my face. If I want to scrub my floors and my countertops I will get some thing else that’s not disposable . I’m not very happy about this at all. I went to every site I could to try to find the original STRONG AND SOFT towels and Viva doesn’t make them anymore apparently. I’m going to try bamboo towels and see if they work better and see if they are also soft as well as strong.

The paper towels leave dust on glass

I waited to write the review as I thought they might grow on me.  They are an odd texture for a paper towel...they are fine to dry your hands, or wipe off a greasy dish before washing it...but they seem to SMEAR the counter surface or glass.  My husband seems to like them in his shop.  Like some others posted they cling to one another on the roll so you need to actually pick it up off the roll. Price was decent, but I won't be buying them again.

These are not as soft/thick as the originals. Please just don’t think we don’t notice!

Wonderfully soft and absorbent but very hard to tear.

I noticed this product has been reduced in size.  I noticed the whole case has been reduced in size so that means I will be getting less as far as the paper towels goes so, I’d appreciate it if you would discontinue this product until further notice.  Thank you for your cooperation, it is greatly appreciated.

NOT the same quality I buy in the store. Thinner.

Maybe these are not what I expected? The rolls are so tight and pulling a sheet is not easy. They stick together, they stretch and mostly tear outside the perforated lines. They’re kind of a mess. If you’re looking for something more useful in your kitchen, buy Bounty or something else.

We’ve always used Viva Signature Towels. They were always thick and easy to tear. Not true anymore.  They’re thinner now and don’t tear easily. I don’t like them. Raise the price, don’t cheapen the towels. 😒

I like these but after a shower I go through so many just to dry off. I’m beginning to wonder who came up with the idea of paper towels. I was going to take a roll to the beach to lay on, but I don’t know if they are right for me. I think the sand may make them fall apart under me.

When we buy Viva Towels, we buy the largest double roll we can get.  What I thought we were getting is not what we got.  Task size?  Who determined the size of the task?  We have great big tasks and these small rolled Viva Towels wont last long at all.  I will give 4 stars instead of 5 because I love Viva Towels.  I did not know Task Size was a thing.

I had used Viva for years and then it seemed they changed the product so it was shedding and leaving residue on mirrors. I believe they are back to the original product but, with that said, a roll is like half the size it used to be and more money.

Viva the old paper formula! Unfortunately, Viva has changed. Perhaps it is because of the pandemic and all of the  supply chain issues, etc. etc. but these paper towels are not like they used to be. Much more rough, not as durable. Hope they go back to the old way of making these paper towels...oh and they aren't in any of the stores they used to be in. Must be a supply chain issue...

I loved the thickness and softness of signature cloth and it's been my go to paper towel for over a decade. Just got my most recent order and signature cloth is now see-through and no longer soft. What a disappointment. Won't spend extra for viva anymore

My family buys Viva often and we are always happy with the softness, durability and thickness.  This order didnot have those qualities. Will not purchase Viva through Amazon again.

Thought super rolls meant big rolls.Not the usual big rolls at grocery stores.

Though still usable, these paper towels are weak and thinner than a good paper towel at the same price. We are not likely to buy again.

I like the absorption that it has but I dislike the fuzziness that comes out.

The product is good. The advertisement of the product is misleading. It says it’s the mega rolls, but it isn’t. They are the small regular rolls. They should change how they advertise the product!

I bought the box in which the rolls 24=36 and I'm getting 6=9.The paper quality is very good.

I read all the great reviews.  So I purchased them.  The quality is good.  The rolls are extremely small.  I mean small.

never again

Papers thinner and not as soft as before. Quality decline...

I received 4 packs (24 total rolls) of "Viva Task Size Signature Cloth Paper Towels".I use paper towels often & to perform various task around my apartment.The rolls are noticeably smaller in size then many other brands of paper towels including other Viva Paper Towels I have purchased in the past.They do have a cloth like feel to them. It's a kind of spongy like texture. I do like these paper towels because they are absorbent but at the same time I don't like them because they leave behind a lint like residue / small fibers when I use them to dry off my Stainless Steel dishes or clear glasses.

This review is for the “NEW” variant, I’m not sure what makes it different from the old.We’ve been using these for about a week now and I guess I don’t really get what makes them better than our regular old Kirkland paper towels. They seem about as prone to tearing and even though they’re “reusable” they’re also thinner and less absorbent so I feel like the pros and cons of this kind of paper towel neutralize each other.Also, I tried to use them to wipe down some work materials with isopropyl alcohol and something about that combination left a weird residue.I guess I just don’t really see how these are any better to use than Kirkland 🤷‍♀️ I’ll update this review if I find a better way to use them.

Great product but the price on line is too expensive.  Can get it cheaper at Wal-Mart.

A little bit soft as paper towel

Picks up everything works great

I like these paper towels, but they were better before they "improved" them.  Visually, there doesn't seem to be much difference.  The new ones are a bit more stretchy, which is okay, I guess.  The big drawback is that they now leave a bit of lint.  I didn't have this problem with the previous version.  When I'm cleaning glass and mirrors, it's very annoying, but especially when I'm using them for face cleansing wipes.  I make them using the rolls cut in half, set in an emptied plastic container with some essential oils, castile soap, and filtered water.  For years, I never had a problem with lint.  Viva, please go back to the unimproved version!!

I love these paper towels. They absorb so much better than other brands with less paper used. Their texture is softer as well. The one downside I’ve found is that they can leave bits of paper “grit” on some surface, like wood tabletops.

Small rolls, huge box. Haven't had to go to store for more for a while. This is my favorite brand of paper towels.

Is it the cheapest paper towel on the market, no. Is it the best paper towel on the market for cleaning a spill, no. It IS a paper towel that is soft enough to also replace facial tissue, and its much cheaper than any of those. Kids like them, I like them, we spend less on paper products than we used to, and we have fewer rolls and boxes sitting around.

I love those towels. I always buy them at the store.  These ones came good but the rolls are so small, each one felt like it was half way used or something. It’s very odd. I never bought them like that at the store.

They leave white pieces behind when I'm cleaning with them. I rent vehicles and I notice the car being free from dirt but little white cloth pieces left on the handles and steering wheel and literally everywhere I cleaned.

The towels are very absorbent. The rolls are small since the sheets of this and many brands are half the size of past paper towels. I am able to use one small towel to clean up most messes.

I have a reoccurring order.  Love these paper towels for spills and clean ups.  They are great for most cleanings, but not for glass.  They tend to wipe streaky.  Every thing else, they do a wonderful job!

Viva - stop diluting your brand by selling junky paper towels that also say Viva on them!!!  These are the Viva paper towels that you intended to buy.  They still seem thinner than they used to be, but these are thicker/better than any other brand out there.

Almost like real towels,,,I love the material

Best paper towels we've ever used.  Just wish they weren't so expensive.

It's not the clothlike Towels they use to be but still the best foe me. Love my Viva Towels.

Good long lasting

as advertised

I really like these paper towels. I almost always take these towels of the Viva brand.

This is the first time I think I’ve ever used cloth paper towels and I can definitely tell the differences between these and regular paper towels. I don’t know what the Viva product was like before this but it seem as if this is their new and updated version of the “signature cloth” series. In this pack you get four packages of 6 rolls, so 24 rolls total. I do think the rolls seem to be smaller than my typical normal paper towels but that’s probably due to them being thinner and sturdier than Bounty or another brand. The material is hard to explain, it’s soft but rough at the same time. It’s squishy and padded but the texture of the whole paper towel is kind of rough. I personally think these cloth paper towels are a lot more sturdy in the way that they don’t rip when they get wet. You can use them for longer because the towels don’t disintegrate. They are also surprisingly absorbent for being so thin but I’m not sure if they’re as absorbent as a normal paper towel.These definitely have pros and cons. They’re more sturdy but maybe less absorbent. The roll is smaller because the paper towels are thinner but the paper towels are tougher. These are definitely on the more expensive side at around $1.38 per roll in this case but you’re also paying for the convenience of having them shipped to your house.

I liked the Viva Signature Cloth Paper Towels for the most part. They really do feel like cloth and seem much more durable and reusable than other paper towels.The one issue I had with it is that the sheets are a bit difficult to remove from the roll. It requires quite a bit of force. I'm used to regular paper towels which can be pulled from a corner. When I try pulling these from the corner, they're so stuck to the roll that the corner sometimes rips.Besides that, these are quite impressive. Would recommend.

So these towels don't shed, but they aren't overly exciting either.  They feel a little like shop towels to me.I realize it has great review, but I don't see what makes them so special.At the time of this review they are selling for $32.99 for four packs of 6.  These aren't even double rolls.  I haven't done the math, but they don't sound any cheaper than major name brands.  So I am not sure what the overwhelming reviews are all about.Overall, they are okay, but I probably won't reorder and don't see what the hype is as they don't seem better than the major brands and they aren't really better priced as far as I can tell.I hope this review was helpful!

One thing we don’t scrimp on are paper towels. These feel like fabric, are super absorbent and perforated in half sheet size. I can scrub with them and they don’t fall apart. They soak up grease like magic. I have to take a deep breath when I restock them because generic paper towels are so much cheaper, but the Viva are worth every dime.

These are the BEST paper towels I have EVER used, I have my daughter & boyfriend addicted to them now!  They literally feel like a soft cloth, they come in halves which is a bonus!! The value for the money is amazing & right now 9/22/24 they are on sale! They do not have any odor, they clean up messes, can be rinsed & reused! Love them

These feel more like cloth than the scratchy, cheaper paper towels. They are quite strong and very absorbent. You won't be dissapointed!

This paper towel is perfect. It's smooth and thick like a flexible cloth. I love the size of the sheets. Very practical. Never fails.

My sister has always sworn by Viva paper Towels. It took me some time to understand why. So then I finally decided to order the large quantity box. And boy once I received them I new the reason. They are the softest, strongest paper towel I have used and I've tried many. The size of the rolls just amazed me. They definitely are worth the price you pay. I am now a believer and see what my sister has said all along. Glad I switched

I’ve tried many different brands of paper towels, but Viva Signature Cloth Paper Towels have become my absolute favorite. With 12 triple rolls and 141 sheets per roll, they last much longer than other towels, making them a great value for the price. What really sets them apart is their durability. These towels are incredibly sturdy, even for tough cleaning tasks. I admit, I’m somewhat of a "paper towel addict," but these towels have actually helped curb my use. Because they’re so absorbent and strong, I find myself using fewer sheets for the same jobs, which is a huge plus.  Highly recommend

These are the best paper towels and now only ones we like to use. They are so soft on skin so easy to use on my 18 month old at dinner time. I use them for everything when cleaning, and often times can reuse them because they dry so quickly. The rolls are super big so they last us a good amount of time. Highly recommend!

no other paper towel comes close to viva.  they used to be even way better, but even though the quality has gone down, they're still head-&-shoulders better than all the rest.  it's not even a competition; there's no comparison.  VIVA!i've "converted" just about everybody i know.  i just have them use a few sheets, & then i ask them, "has any other brand u've ever used, felt that good in your hand, & on your skin?  do u really NOT want the best by far, for yourself - just because it costs a few measley bucks more?  aren't u worth it?"they all get it, & they all make the switch.and don't even think of buying these at the physical store - they cost way, way more there - definitely TOO much (considering what u pay here - plus if u compare the different versions, & figure out which one is the biggest bargain).wait...  forget everything i said.  if ALL of u take my recommendation, that could cause a shortage - which could mean they'll be "out of stock" when i go on here to buy 'em.  hmmmm...errrr... don't listen to me.  i'm only able to write this review because they let me out of the straight-jacket for one hour every day...errr...  i mean... I AM A RO-BOT<> BE/BOOP<> I AM Ai<> I AM AN ALGORITHM<> BE/BOOP..."ERRoR, eRR0r..."errr...  i mean:  "Al Gore has rhythm"...obviously, 5 stars.

Viva paper towels are the best I have ever used. They are thick and strong, which means saving time and money. These towels are perforated so the size can be chosen by the job. The thickness is more like a shop towel than a paper towel. This allows me to use them for tougher jobs without having to go back for more. I highly recommend Viva paper towels.

I like this brand and paper towel size and have been using the same product for nearly 5 years. The towel is thick and the product is a good price for the quantity. It’s my subscription purchase that I have had on repeat since a year before the pandemic.

These are really the best paper towels around.  We use a lot of them due to spills and for re-heating things in the microwave (3 kids).  They are soft and super absorbent.  when I make jerky and need to dab the marinade off, I can use three sheets for a 2lb batch of jerkey on a cookie sheet.  They are very absorbent.

Yes, they are not as good as they used to be.  But NO brand is at this point.  For the current decent quality; thick enough, tearing mostly easily at the perforation, soft, and size, it is my current go to for quality and price.  When the quality goes down, or the price goes up, I will find something else.  But for now, this is my new go to. Five stars for CURRENT paper towel comparables.  So far has been packaged well, but I do ask for the outer box in that section to ensure they are not too damaged during shipping.

I love these paper towels.  They feel like soft cloth so you can use them for many different things and not just to blot up spills.

I LOVE viva because I can wet them for a cloth like clean, they’re absorbent, strong, and tear smoothly. I guess I didn’t pay attention when ordering so I didn’t realize I would be getting two packs, but it was an incredibly great price for so many big rolls. I use paper towels so often and I haven’t found one as strong or soft as viva.

These paper towels are THE BEST. They are the only ones I use. They are so versatile. Soft and sttong. I ca. wipe the baby’s face and hands with it. I love the size so I can use just what I need. Honestly blowing my nose is the best because it doesn’t breakdown and get germs all over. I love the large quantity as we go through these pretty fast.

I was thrilled to see that this was still available and on subscribe and save! I got booted over to the 'new' Viva which aren't bad, but just not that great. These cloth-like ones absorb so well and I use far fewer of them than I did the 'new' paper towels. I love them!

Our favorite - so soft and so absorbant. We have these on auto-order every month and wouldn't use anything else.

Very happy with this product. Very disappointed in my local grocery store for no longer carrying this exact product. They have other Viva products, but this particular product changed my world view on what a paper towel can and should be. There is no other paper towel I want.

The best paper towels that I know of.  And it’s good that they have some sustainability feature(s). The one not good thing about them is their high price.  Please don’t discontinued them

These thick pap towels are the best! They are soft and yet rough enough to clean any mess.

How can any other brand compare to this durable, soft, strong, thick paper towel.Always the best!Love the 12 rolls package.

Thee best in the market!! Would not use any other paper towels

Love the quality and softness

For me it’s the best paper towel on the market

These are more expensive but worth every penny. I buy them when I have the extra. Makes all the difference i. Cleaning. You can rence them out and reuse over and over too. Very durable.

They are just like cloth, like silky fabric! Try this product and you won’t ever go back to ordinary paper towels! 💙

Don’t leave lint behind, different sizes for different applications, very soft and amazing to wipe the dirty face, very durable for paper towels, the appearance is as of a cloth instead of printed paper towels.

Viva feels like towels , soft yet absorbent

I like that you can use 1/2 sheets.These are my favorite paper towels.

Best paper towels made. Nothing more to say.

Boy I bought a lot. Lol roommates were like plan on having a tub full of jello? needed something to clean it w

We love these. They are very strong and do not fall apart. They can be rinsed and reused for wiping up.Excellent around the house or useing then with the cars.

Great product and super strong

I'm glad to have discovered this brand. The quality is better than Bounty and more sturdy

Always our favorite paper towel

These are my go to paper towels. They are strong, well priced, and you can chose to tear a half or whole sheet.

I have used Bounty for years and accidentally found Viva. Love these they absorb great and feel like a cloth. I will never go back.

I buy these for my church and they last alot longer than regular paper towels

Wonderful grip and stretch. The quality of this brand is beyond others. Very soft and you get a lot for your money. I bought this months ago and use a lot of sheets daily and still have not ran out. Well worth it

This is the best toweling.  Nice and thick. Won't but any other brand. Best toweling & a good price

Hands down, the best paper towel on the market.  Others are no different than toilet paper. This fabric-like fiber holds together and you can really clean, rinse and go again!

I just love these! Worth the money. High quality, best absorbency of any I’ve used. Compact & easy to store.

Always buy these in bulk.  Much cheaper than buying in stores.

These are our favorite paper towels, they just feel better than other paper towels.

Now during the dreadful times of 2020, due to certain “conditions” of the day, toilet paper was hard to come by. One day my fiancé went out to see if he could procure some priceless TP and he came back, triumphant gleam in his eyes. “Woman, I bring you the high and mighty trophy of toilet paper! For nothing is too good for my queen, my sweet love, my darling soulmate!” As I inspected his loot, I realized that despite its luxurious texture it was not, in fact, toilet paper. “Oh dearest, these are paper towels! Not toilet paper, whatever shall we do?” I cast myself on the floor sobbing, but my brave and handsome warrior went forth and slew many trolls and orcs in a grand quest to find the precious paper, which he eventually brought home, trumpets crying out his feat of strength and perseverance! Fanfare filled our humble halls, huzzah! Huzzah! But we were left with six rolls of Viva, signature cloth, paper towels. Lest he think me ungrateful for his first attempt to keep our hind ends clean, I eventually used the paper towels to clean our humble abode. Oh happy day! Signature cloth indeed! Absorbent and perfectly sized (about 6” x11”) per sheet, we have exclusively used this brand for years now. Once I accidentally bought the regular viva paper towels instead of the signature ones, and I will never make that mistake again! These are the Cadillac of paper towels. Treat yourself to the very best, and give these a try. And if you don’t like them, give them to me! I promise I will give them a good home next to our kitchen sink.

I don't remember how many years I've used these paper towels, but, it's at least 20 years. I'm completely unable to use any other paper towels since I began using these. However, due to the price, I'm going to begin using old cloths/towels.

I've been using Viva paper towel (signature cloth) for more than 10 years and surprisingly this is the first time I wrote a review for it. Where to start, I almost feel that Viva could be reusable (well if you are dealing with some light dust, as you just need to wash the paper towel and re-use it once or twice). The thing I liked about Viva the most is its durability and consistency. I did not feel any deterioration of the Viva brand for the past 10 years so when it comes to paper towel, Viva is my only go-to brand.

Soft and super- absorbent.  The only store I could find this product in stopped carrying it almost a year ago…..bring it back, Wegman’s!  I feel ridiculous buying paper towels online, lol!

Quality

I've been getting the Viva Signature Cloth paper towels for several years with my monthly Subscripe & Save. For some reason they shipped me these Multi-Surface towels instead as an error on Amazon's end, and I can't believe the difference in quality. I didn't notice they were the wrong product until I opened up a pack, and it was so evident that these were not my trusted towels. The Multi-Surface are rough, not as absorbent or durable, and no better than a generic dollar store paper towel. The Signature Cloth towels are amazing, durable, soft and super high quality. When I contacted Amazon to find out why they shipped me the wrong towels this month, I got no explanation - just an offer to return them to get the correct towels shipped to me. The size of the case is enormous and I already recycled the original box because I didn't notice they were the wrong towels until days after I unpacked them all and stored them away as usual, so now I need to rummage around to find a box big enough to hold the entire case, buy packing tape to get them packaged back up, drag it down a few flights of stairs. Not to mention I live in NYC (no car) so I'd have to lug a box that's bigger than me on a subway to get them to a UPS drop-off. This was Amazon's error, and I'm so disappointed that I have to do all this additional legwork to return the wrong product they shipped to me. Very frustrating, the customer service has gone downhill. I'm seeking alternatives for purchasing my monthly products, several other companies are competing well with Amazon in prices, customer service and consistency.

I've been a huge fan of Viva paper towels for years and have had them on my subscribe and save lists for ages. Somehow my subscription was "lost" during the great paper product shortage of the past pandemic year, and I must have mistakenly ordered these instead.I knew that they looked different from the Viva that I know and love, but it wasn't until today that I actually used them. They are truly terrible. Not absorbent. Not soft. Certainly not something that could substitute as a napkin in a pinch--and woe betide the poor nose that ends up with one of these when someone forgets to buy more tissue.I really am at a loss as to why Viva makes them... they remind me of the recycled materials paper towels you get at Whole Foods (truly terrible in every way except to virtue signal, which you can't even do once the wrapper is off) except I don't think they actually are made of recycled materials. They are like the bad old days of Bounty or Brawny or any of the other crappy paper towels that I used before I discovered Viva.And I have a whole, huge box full. Sigh. My first thought was "maybe I can donate them to a food pantry" and then realized how much that's like giving cans of pickled beets--"Here's something useless--happy holidays!"So, do yourself a favor and be sure to look for the SIGNATURE Viva paper towels and give these a hard pass.

I guess I thought all Biva paper towels were the same.. and they're not. I'm a fan of the signature cloth. It lasts forever & they're durable. Wish I hadn't made this purchase.

I have always loved Cloth like Viva towels. They have superior absorption and feel soft on the touch.So—I ordered (2) 6 pack triple rolls.Imagine to my surprise that they were very cheap paper towels and not at all what I’ve used before.I paid so much for them and can’t afford to throw them out. I was willing to pay more for these towels because of the quantity.Does Kimberly Clark have a cheaper brand they sell to Amazon?

Something has changed on the texture that I don't like at all, feels like cardboard not smooth with a tendency to stick together that I like

This paper towel that may have the name Viva on it is nothing like the original Viva do not buy it you will just be disappointed it does not do the same thing it doesn't even come close to the original Viva paper towels these are junk you might as well buy the dollar store ones That's how garbage they are. I'm going to try to submit pictures of the difference between the two of them later

I ordered these and I was supposed to get 24 rolls.  The box that it was shipped in which was a Viva brands box had half of the paper towels missing with the plastic wrapping that contained 6 towels each missing half the wrapping on one with 2 of the paper towels missing.  The Viva customer service has refused to refund me or make up the difference in missing paper towels.  For that I will now be using a different brand.  I understand mistakes happen but to not make it right is just unacceptable and not a company I care to do business with.

I don't know why they had to go and mess with a good thing. I picked Viva over the other higher name-recognition brands because it was like getting rolls of CLOTH, not paper. I hate that they abandoned their quality and chose to switch over to be like Bounty. The paper towels aren't nearly as good as they used to be and it's sad. Bring back the cloth-like towels!

These are NOT the cloth paper towels that they sell, these feel like every other brand. I ordered based off of the title, title needs to be updated to remove the word cloth. I have never found these to be better than any other basic paper towels but the actual cloth versions are amazing.

I buy viva cloth paper towels they are super soft and these ate not. Very disappointed that I paid almost 40$ for paper towels I could have paid 15$ for Don't buy them if you want the soft cloth ones because you won't get them

We use the cloth viva for its softness. This is rough and scratchy, nothing like cloth viva. It's like the cheapest paper towels and now we are stuck with 24 rolls of this trash

These are bargain garbage paper towels. Not the good viva. Store brand stuff

Seriously what happened to Viva used to be so soft!No, you cannot even get them apart. The rolls are so small.  They don’t even last a day.It’s pointless to even buy that product back to Costco buying the cheap stuff which is worth it since I thought maybe Viva was almost the same price I would try them again, but I was wrong.

I was so excited to find this bull order of Viva CLOTH paper towels in bulk. You know the good soft stuff that feels like, Um cloth?! These are cheap snd thin and such a waste of money. If they weren’t late and we had already gone a day without paper towels I absolutely be returning them. I didn’t even know Viva made such cr*ppy paper towels? I’m so bummed because since we absolutely needed some for the night we are now stuck with so many bad roles. Why they call these “cloth” I have no idea. Ugh. Absolutely not worth buying unless you really don’t care about the texture and softness

This is not my Viva that I have always baught. Is there different types. This wasn't soft. There was hardly anything on each roll. I was very dissatisfied.

On the left is what Viva paper towel used to be. It was like cloth. Now it is like the cheap brands of paper towel. What didn't change is price.

It's regular paper material, a Viva knock off.

My purchase was canceled due to the supplier not having it at the time when I needed it so honestly can't review it cuz I never received it they canceled it.But I will say this is my favorite brand especially the cloth ones they are amazing but are very overpriced

Not the good Viva towels that don't unroll; grossly overpriced.

I love my normal Viva!  I first started using them taking a cake decorating class, believe it or not smooth frosting on top of the cake. Then I realized how amazingly soft and absorbent they were and abuse them ever cents for years and years. I subscribe to these paper towels and never changed a thing, and all of a sudden began receiving these new multi surface paper towels. I hate them! I cannot use them for my cakes, they are not soft, they are rough and scratchy and feel cheap.

Viva “cloth” paper towels was how this item was presented. I LOVE Viva cloth paper towels. Upon receipt of said “cloth” paper towels- these are NOT the Viva paper towels I use!! The ones sent were “paper towels”! Nothing like the cloth paper towels Viva is known for!! Extremely disappointed in this product!!

Description for this item was misleading it said these were the cloth like ones. I purchased believing it was the ones I always get turns out it was the scratchy paper like ones. I will not be purchasing again through Amazon from now on I will purchase at store where I can see what I am getting. I did not have the ability to go to a return point to return the large case I ordered so I’m stuck with the scratchy nonabsorbent paper towel

I’ve had Viva paper towels on subscribe and save for the last 4+ years. The ones that were sent to me this month are so sad. The quality is nothing like what I’m used to, even though the cost has gone up 25%. I want to send them back, but I feel bad making our postal workers deliver this back. So my solution was to cancel my subscribe and save for this product and I’ll just go back to buying the generic Kirkland brand.

We've subscribed to these for years, and I'm cancelling now. They changed the cloth recently. These used to be soft and fluffy, highly absorbent, and generally wonderful paper towels. The new ones are hard, rough, and don't absorb well at all. They're cheap garbage, except I'd expect cheap garbage to cost less. Looking elsewhere for something comparable to the old ones. Don't waste your money here. Get something you'll want to use.

These are not the old-time Viva, that you could use and use and even accidentally wash in the washing machine and use again. These paper towels have the name but not the quality do yourself a favor and save money and buy Bounty. I like the Bounty better! I was very disappointed in these. Trust me if you use to buy Viva's these are not the same Viva you use to love.

I don’t like the rough texture of these towels.

Garbage compared to signature version  Bought these by mistake thanks to misleading advertising and tagging by Amazon. Not nearly as good quality but very overpriced. On any ways similar to the bargain basement junk you can get for next to nothing at Walmart. Avoid

So very disappointed that I ordered so many but these are not the regular normal Viva paper towels that are like cloth these are actually like most other paper towels they are textured and they are not soft the quality is just not there for the price

The subscribe and save order until the this / last few months changed. It used to be the well known cloth like papertowel. Now it’s like thick rough recycled Fast food napkins. Cancelling my subscribe and save of 24 rolls at a time and going to another brand. Bad choice to change Viva!

I’m not sure what happened but these are not the Viva I’ve bought at store. These a rough as sandpaper and not absorbent like usual purchase. I miss one where you could use - dry and reuse. These are single use and you need a lot more than usual.

I had my Viva paper towel on Subscribe and Save and I just opened this shipment that arrived in May and was greatly disappointed by the quality. I thought it was Bounty but the package did say "Viva". This is no way the same Viva cloth that I've been using for years. What happened?

Not absorbant.  Waste of money on these

If itain’t broke don’t fix it! Whatever happened to the chamois soft viva towels??? These are like cheap storebrand quality. Positively ghastly ‼️‼️‼️I cringe every time I use them. For sure I am canceling my subscription order, these are just garbage…… And very expensive garbage

Not task size rolls as advertised, deception at it best

As others have commented, these are not the Viva paper towels you're looking for. The reformulation makes it a pale imitation of what makes the original Viva so premium. Soft, durable and absorbent they are not. I am cancelling it from my Amazon subscription.

I have signature viva on subscribe and save. The last two shipments switched signature to this horrible multi surface style without asking me.  It didn't compare to the absorbency, durability and reusable signature Viva

Cheap flimsy impersonator viva paper towels!!!!!! Not at all what I anticipated. Super disappointed

These are NOT the Viva paper towels I used to buy at the store. They are not thick or cloth like. These are just cheap generic paper towels. Never ordering these again.

clearly not the same quality of paper towel sold in stores.

Hated em.Tgey are like sandpaper not like the regular viva I order that are like cotton ball soft.please help.Thabk you.ilike I said I spend 1000's of $ with u.ease make it right.Thank u

These are nothing like the old Viva they are cheap and rough not soft and like a towel like the old ones. What to heck happened?!!  I will buy another brand This is not what I ordered

I loved the soft, absorbent Viva PT’s, these are literally equivalent to $1 store paper towels- rough, thin, and take five times as many.  What happened to the soft, durable PT’s?!? These are a ripoff.

Viva used to be the gold standard for paper towels. Now they are rough! Not at all soft like they used to be. I will not be reordering. Time to find a new brand.

I’ve been subscribed to receiving Viva paper towels for several years with Amazon, but they went and changed their towels. Now they’re no better than dollar general brand junk. What the heck happened?!?

The rolls are tiny.

The text may have been updated now but there was about 60% of the sq ft listed. Not a good deal.

I am very upset, after ordering and subscribing - which I will cancel, I discovered these are not the soft vivo. Very disappointing.

Poor quality paper towel. Not near the quality I've come to expect of a Viva towel.

How about a useful review that tells you exactly what you came here to find out? What I needed to know before buying this.Remember the first time you held your first squishy yet super dense Viva roll? "Oh, interesting!" you thought. You peeled away a half sheet with perfect tear perforations and used it - It worked amazing. Soft, super comfy, super unique feeling, stretchy! You can soak them, ring them out, shake them out and they hold together amazing! Then you discovered you can tear off 1" (or any size) strips in straight lines, perfectly sized to wipe off the butter knife and throw away. And you knew without a doubt that you'd never get anything other than these ever again.Well this is not that. These are rough scratchy rolls exactly like every other cheap paper towel on the market and not even as comfy as Bounty.Now I have to get through a ton of rolls before I can finally get the ones I assumed I was getting to begin with. Viva is known for their amazing rolls as I described above. To make this product instead, without making it obvious that these are not the same thing as what made their reputation is MESSED UP. In my opinion.That said, they absorb fine, tear fine, blah blah blah. It's not the same though not even remotely close to the same as those other wonderful towels that we all love.

I used to use Viva paper towels as a substitute for cloth rags. I even used them for baby wipes and they worked great for that. They have changed and now it’s just another paper towel. So disappointed. Too expensive for what it is. No good for rags, not terrible as baby wipes but not as good as the real thing, like they used to be.

Ordered by mistake.  We'll use them cause we are out of others, but  beware - these are humongous rolls and do not fit well in under cabinet towel holders.  Don't seem like the Viva of the early days either when they could be used on a variety of surfaces and were highly absorbent.  Looks like the old Bounty might be a better choice.

I ordered these because they were on sale and seemed like a good price for Viva. However, these are not the same as the thick cloth style ones I have purchased from my local stores in the past. They are certainly adequate but not as nice as Bounty and certainly not as nice as the Viva towels I was expecting. As my child said, “they look and feel like toilet paper”. Would not buy again.

We love Viva paper towels but, not the ones we got. They are rough and not the soft, cloth feeling that we like. Won't buy again.

This thing is massive!

Are not what I expected

Used it as a regular paper towel

I don't know where these are stored but two orders in a row have smelled strongly of chemicals.  I won't buy again.

I wanted the soft fabric type but you sent the rougher type. Please indicate the soft fabric type next time.

I purchased this bundle because I saw they were advertised as Multi-Surface towels. What I didn't realize is that these weren't the Signature Cloth. These Multi-Surface towels don't stand up to wear and tear of the Signature Cloth. They are simply a standard paper towel. Very disappointing when compared to the Signature Cloth, with which I love to clean. Also the 81 sheets they boast of on the packaging is 81 half-sheets ... which I would hardly call 40 full-sized paper towels a "super roll". Unfortunately I disassembled the box they were delivered in so I can't return them. Live and learn!

These "super" rolls are smaller than normal sized rolls from Wal-Mart. Will not purchase again.

SMALL rolls, wouldn't buy again.  Read all the quantity description and compare for yourself.

These are very small tools ,I was going to return them but it’s a big box and just a lot of trouble but next time I will stick with bounty..

Viva papertowels have been in my Subscribe & Save list forever. l loved how soft and absorbent they were - dense paper,just like cloth. Recently Viva changed the paper. It is rough, falls apart, an I need to use more for cleaning. Might as well be buying the cheap dollar store brand. I'll find another S & S brand to order.

This paper towel is like two ply toilet paper

Glad to see these towels back on the shelves. But the description is all over the place.Each roll is 81 sheets and they are not as good as the original. Just not absorbent.I will not buy these again nor do I recommend them. My own opinion.

Product very stiff, WILL NOT BUY AGAIN. Why have they messed up a great product !!!!

Wow... VIVA really went downhill! These are not the cloth like paper towels that they used to make. Definitely wont buy them again, they feel like generic cheap crap.Miss the old good quality Viva!

I was highly disappointed when I received these paper towels as part of my subscription to Viva Cloth as a replacement.  They are not soft nor sturdy like the original Viva Cloth. These are just OK and not a good value for what I wanted. I can get a store brand that is significantly less expensive and comparable to this product.

It is a textured/embossed variety.  More like a dollarXtore item

These are not what they used to be. Very generic now

They changed the texture/design of the product. And now the end of the roll flip flops and takes up too much space. Annoying. I'd rather have the old version that required peeling off a sheet.

I have been on automatic delivery for months now. I received a new shipment a couple weeks ago and they sent the wrong paper towels. I’m thinking they changed their towels because the ones they sent before were strong, soft and absorbent. The ones that I received a couple weeks ago are the complete opposite! They are ruff, not absorbing at all , and are horrible to clean with!

I don’t like being baited and switched. This is not the cloth like paper towels. Why does it say cloth? They are regular rough paper towels. Of course I only just opened the package to discover this, after the return window has closed.

Viva Signature Cloth is thick and absorbent and lasts. It is by far the best paper towel I've ever used. This is a cheap and overpriced version of Bounty and is gone before you know it.

Using these paper towels leaves a lot of shredded material on my countertops. This defeats their purpose as far as I’m concerned.

The rolls are so small. I used to love this brand but since they changed the produce a couple of years ago, I’ve been disappointed. They’re not cheap and I can go through a roll in a day. Not worth the money to me.

We had subscribed to the Viva Signature Cloth paper towels and were switched to these when our preferred towels were apparently unavailable. The Signature Cloth towels were great - soft, absorbent, and strong. These are... not that. They're rough, and not very thick, and the rolls seemingly have many fewer towels. Well likely be canceling our subscription and restarting the hunt for quality paper towels.

I got this product during the Covid period. It was even more expensive then but the rolls were somewhat larger. These  are much  smaller  rolls. Perhaps even smaller than the regular size. So you are not  buying 24 rolls but you are actually buying 12 rolls, medium size. Therefore the price is very  high.

I’ve been a Viva buyer for as long as they’ve been made. Up until this delivery, they were soft and absorbent. What was delivered was Viva Multi-task Cloths, they are not the same and definitely not as good as the original towels. I wish I’d not opened them because I would have returned them. Such a disappointment.

Not a good value. Rolls are approx half the size of those in retail stores.

I specifically used to buy Viva because I loved the feel and durability of the old material and in my latest S&S delivery, they are totally different. They feel like Bounty, which I intentionally don't buy because I have always preferred Viva. Ugh, such a bummer :(

Thought I was getting the Viva cloth paper towels like my usual subscription. Just opened latest box and it's not the cloth. Very disappointed. Not what I think of as Viva.

The previous version was cloth-like.  These…. are not that.  At all.  I thought other reviews of the softness level were an exaggeration.  They are not.Great towel, before.  Time to look for a better product.

Viva sells two different types of paper towels. This particular order just wasn’t the cloth-like soft quality I was looking for. But, it does seem more absorbent than store brand paper towels.

These are not the soft viva rolls I buy from the store. There’s a lot for the money but the quality is completely different then what I expected (rough texture).

I have been using VIVA task size for years to wipe children faces, dust wood, & absorb spills. These are a rough textured task size. The roll stood next to my super size is smaller diameter.

Not the same as the old kind. Bummed they switched the product.  I guess this is the end of me being willing to pay more for viva brand. oh well.

Poor quality of paper, softness and absorption

Was very disappointed when I received these. They remind me of the cheap store brand ones.

The texture of this product changed two months ago. Why? I could get the same quality buying the Walmart brand. Subscription canceled.

These are margin well paper towels. They are cheap, and you get what you pay for

The ones we usually get are sturdy yet soft. These last ones are very hard

For around the same price, bounty is far superior. These feel like cheap rough napkins that don't do much.

Accidentally picked the wrong Viva paper towels. These are too rough.

These new version are just like any other paper towel

Yuck I hate these.

These paper towels are great. They aren’t super soft but they aren’t rough either. Most importantly they’re long lasting and durable. However, I’m happy I ordered them when I did because they just raised the prices significantly. It was down to 30 cents per sheet, which was a huge savings compared to BOUNTY brand (which is a much softer paper towel). This month, with their prices raised, it’s 61 cents per sheet. Nearly double. With BOUNTY still holding firm at 50 cents per sheet for a durable, soft, task-sized paper towel I will be cancelling this subscription and going back to BOUNTY when we need to reorder.

This Multi-Surface is not good at all. They fall apart easily, they are not strong and not multi-surface. I tried it with some wood furniture and they started to tear easily, leaving lints and fiber of the paper towel on the surface. Expensive and not good at all. I compare this one to a regular Bounty paper towel. If I can returne it and change it for the Original Viva Cloth paper towel I will, but I have a restaurant and I used half of a package in 2 days

The paper towels were your ordinary paper towels.  I usually order the Viva brand at Walmart but the papertowels I usually buy are soft and cloth-like and easier to use for cleaning  and wiping things clean.  The durability of these papertowels were not as good, therefore, I was disappointed in them.

While these paper towels ARE thick and soak up a lot of fluid; they HAVE CHANGED from what they used to be.  Years ago, Viva towels were the ONLY paper towels I could find that were NOT paper~like and scratchy.  They were thick, yet still soft and able to soak up A LOT.  Now, however, the Viva towels are no better than any other thick paper towel.  If the price is right, buy them.  If not, you will probably find a comparable item in another brand.

I thought I was buying their softer brand they offer. These are good but the softer ones are much better to me. I will buy those next time I am out.

Ordinary, stiff

Some years ago, they change the texture and make up of these paper tiles. There is good as any, but not Nearly as good as they were Before the change

Disappointing to find that after some years of using a different brand, I chose to select these again and they are much thinner than before.  They are cheaper but the thinness makes sure we go through them MUCH faster than before.

These are not the real cloth paper towels. The real cloth ones from Vivia are soft and absorb a lot. These are decent paper towels but I pay extra for the cloth ones, like I did this time. They are labeled cloth but they are not, could have save money buying any brand if I was not going to get the soft cloth ones.

When cleaning up these paper towels would leave paper fibers on the surface you cleaned. Sometimes you get what you pay for.

The price is not significantly different than Bounty. I went with the Viva due to more per roll. Imo, the Bounty are just as soft & absorbent. I do like that neither of them don’t shed lint when ripping a sheet off.

These used to be the premier towels; thick and soft with what seemed like endless rolls. I paid the extra money just to have them for special occasions. Without warning, the last auto-shipment I got had these...normal paper towels in it. I don't know what these are, but they are not what I know as Viva towels. Perhaps they reintroduced the originals with another name and a higher price? I don't know, but these are not the Viva towels you expect. No thanks.

Honestly not a bad bang for your buck but we bought these thinking they were the plush paper towels and these guys are just regular run of the mill paper towels. Perfect for the kitchen just not what we bought them for which was for face wipes.

Don't think I have seen viva rolls this big in any of the stores. It's not the soft rolls of Viva paper towels I was expecting. I love the soft Viva towels. 😭

They are not as soft as the regular viva brand

Not sure exactly why but it seems i am constantly refilling my paper towel holder.  Fewer on roll? Less aborbent? Smaller size?  Even my roommate, who notices nothing, even remarked how quickly we used the paper towels.

Much lighter weight.  Not as heavy duty.I’ll stick with the original viva cloth towels.

These weren't the Viva Paper Towels we're used too. They felt like the sparkle brand and left a sour taste in my mouth seeing how expensive these were.

These are your typical value oriented grocery store paper towels. I've ordered Viva paper towels from Amazon before that were fantastic these are not them. I just can't find him here on Amazon anymore maybe they're only sold in the premium grocery stores I don't know.

Although the label says Viva they don’t come close to the Viva Signature Cloth

Inadequate

these used to be the best paper towels. Not such a fan anymore. Less useable & due to the change. They are just a regular paper towel such as Bounty, store brand, or less costly paper towels. Not strong enough anymore to be used more than 1 time

These are not that strong. Stick to Bounty

Not as advertised. These are paper towels not the true Viva cloth towels as advertised.

I have used VIVA towels for years and years they use to be the best paper towel out there on the market. Whoever decided to change their entire approach and give customers cheap quality paper towels while still charging the top price is absurd!! These towels look like a complete imposter to what I remember VIVA paper towels to be. The SIGNATURE brand has a quality cloth like strength and softness that was the best you could get. I expected better from this company, it has a dollar store material paper towels and the price of a signature, and then to think we as customers who have used them for years would not know the difference?

I have been exclusively using Viva Signature Cloth paper towels for years.  They are like no other paper towels (IYKYK.)  Amazon was out of Signature Cloth on a recent Subscribe and Save delivery so I subbed these.  They are basically just regular paper towels with less absorbency and strength than the Signature Cloth.  I do like the task size, but for the price, I could get any paper towel.  I won't seek these out again.

These aren't thick like they were before. Almost no difference between these & regular paper towels. Certainly not reusable like before.Will be switching back to non-rippled option & if those are thinner then will find new brand.

Had to switch up our subscription and apparently received these. Moment my husband handed a sheet to me, I hated it.Still super absorbent and preferable to almost all paper towels. Those expecting something similar to the cloth feel of their other product will be sorely disappointed.

It's Viva, it's decent quality paper towels, but it's NOT the soft signature cloth, it's thier textured paper towel. It's durable, works good, nothing wrong with it, but I prefer the soft cloth. It's still a great deal.

I use to get the half-size viva paper towels and it kept coming out of stock but usually, I skipped it because I had more than I needed. I thought I had skipped this last month, but I didn't and got paper towels. The multi-surface, they sent in its place and I wasn't aware. They are not the same. They feel more like Cottonelle toilet paper with the texture. I won't order these again as far as the VIVA name goes. I'll find the regular ones I use to buy.

I wish it was still as good as before

I ordered these because you were out if signature cloth paper towels. MISTAKE. They were too stiff for me.  The next shipment I hope is signature cloth.

Clothlike towels are way better.  These are cheap and not good in my opinion.

These are not the same as before the Pandemic, they are very ruff, the old one was.soft. like cloth. They are not as absorbtant either.  I have used Viva since they came on the market, please bring the old back!

These are advertised as the cloth paper towels (and it says that on the package) but are just regular paper towels. They aren't terrible paper towels but not what they say they are. Will not be ordering again!

I like these paper towels however I prefer the softer ones for cleaning mirrors excetera. Right now at the moment nothing is a bargain. The pandemic has caused price gouging. Which is a very unfortunate thing we were having a hard enough time as it is.

I thought this was a cloth type of wipe, it is a regular paper towel, but it does do the job.

I don’t know what happened to these Paper towels. They are NOT as soft and durable as they used to be.

I thought these were the traditional soft viva paper towels. They are not. They get the job done but not what I wanted.

These are priced well, but they are not the same softness as the ones you get at the grocery store. These are more stiff like generic value brands.

These paper towels are better than most generics in store types. They absorb well and are soft. They do have more lint than what I normally purchase, but haven’t found any paper towels that are completely lint free.However the price I pay for my normal warehouse brand is lower for the same amount and I feel like they are better quality. I would only get these again if my local warehouse was out.

I was confused by the pro product description that said these were cloth paper towels I wasn't sure what a cloth paper towel would be, but these are just paper towels: there is nothing special about them and in fact, they are  really not very good. I never really thought about paper towels being more than one ply, but these are two ply towels that immediately pull apart.

Adequately absorbent, but not as soft as other options. Gets most jobs done for a little less.

I got use to the softer Viva before I was only after to get the Multi-Task. This product Muti,you use less because of the feel so it does what it says but the softer cloth Viva, you actually use more because of the feel and I used it more around the babies with their care, the Multi I use to do more house work in the kitchen , bathroom and laundry room. Recommend both !!

Paper towels are ok. They are a little better than the value paper towel. Not what I wa expecting. I thought I bought the cloth like towels. In my opinion these are too expensive.  I think the bounty ones are a lot better.

I purchased a large box of viva, by far always the best.What did you do, they are not the same, they are cheaper, like a cheap paper towel,ARE YOU CUTTING BACK ON PRODUCT ???

Absorbent and the perfect weight for basic use but sheds too much lint for cleaning glass/glossy surfaces.

Size, quality and durability at the highest level. Worth the price.

I cannot rave enough about this brand of paper towels. Super thick very cloth like, super soft texture. Absorbs a lot of fluid and works great for cleaning up messes. love the select a size so that you’re not wasting a bunch of paper towels. These are higher in cost, but you do use less of them. I purchased these when they were on sale so it was a great buy.

Viva are the best most absorbant paper towels available. Yes they're not cheap, but as the saying goes sometimes you do get what you pay for. Brawny paper towels are not even in the same ball park as these.

They are paper towels, and they work like they are supposed to.  I will NEVER order from this supplier again because of how they arrived.  I requested that the Viva box be put inside an Amazon box so no one could tell what was in there.  The outside box (the Amazon box) was in perfect condition.  However, the box inside was crushed beyond belief.  It looked like a 250-pound person stomped on it.  Everything was crushed -- all of the paper cores were crushed and cannot be put on my paper towel holder.  Ridiculous for what I paid for them.

Wow!!! Best ever. Texture is great. Quality more value for your money The size is great these paper towels absorb a lot more liquid than other brands so I highly recommend them.

They seem to have change the texture of these paper towels. I buy them specifically to make homemade wipes and unfortunately the new texture doesn’t work as well with the wipes. Kind of bummed, but will probably still continue to use these as cheaper ones just disintegrate when I make them as a wipe.

Confusing description. Thought I was ordering the soft cloth like product.

This product is okay -- and was decently priced.  The "task" size is a bit smaller than my current brand, but works.

I love this brand and have used It for many many years.  My last delivery when I stacked on top of my older order I noticed how much smaller these rolls are compared to a month ago.  Price was more also.  So, I may look for a better deal on a nother brand.  I am disappointed with this. I would use these smaller rolls faster than I like.

These are good but they are not the cloth-like viva towels for anyone who is looking for those.

Inflation?!? Maybe?!? Love Viva, it is pricier than most brands, but 💯 worth the expense because it works so well. Last few months though the rolls are smaller!! Boo…there are less paper towels on the rolls, although same great quality so I can only complain a little.

These paper towels do the job without being too rough. It's hard to find affordable paper towels in bulk that are still of good value. Luckily this pack of paper towels do the job and last awhile.

Wish they still made the other style this on is not as good

These are good towels, not great. They are not the same as the individual rolls you buy at the store. They are not as thick nor as soft. But I have bought them 2 times so they are doable for the price.

A little firmer than they used to be but better for cleaning windows as they don’t fall apart like some towels. No too soft to absorb sweat but good absorption.

I like the feel and the half sheet option.

These are really nice but the package arrived damaged

My only complaint is I wish there was more towels on each roll

I like the other type of viva

These paper towels provide exceptional quality and performance, but they do come at a slightly higher price point compared to other brands. However, the investment is well worth it for the superior features these paper towels offer. They are soft to the touch, yet incredibly strong and absorbent, making them ideal for a wide range of cleaning tasks around the home.Despite being a little more expensive, these paper towels deliver outstanding value with their durability and effectiveness. Whether you're wiping down surfaces, cleaning up spills, or drying dishes, these paper towels excel in every task. Their cloth-like texture ensures a gentle clean without leaving behind any lint or residue, leaving your surfaces sparkling clean and streak-free.Overall, while they may be a bit pricier than other options on the market, the Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels are worth the investment for their unbeatable quality and performance. Keep your home clean and tidy with these premium paper towels that offer the perfect combination of softness, strength, and absorbency.

Not the old Viva paper towels as they are not as strong (they tear more easily). Absorbency is about the same but they are not as soft as what was available in the past. Oddly enough, they could be used repeatedly for a greater period. I do not see value here.

These are so nice to use.  They are so much better than the previous brand I was using. I can dry my hands with a half sheet my hands are dry and the towel is not soggy.  One roll has lasted so long that my boyfriend even noticed. These are great for our kids and their spills.

I am using these in my shop.  I have used the traditional Viva towels for years and am a fan of those.  These are not as soft but work great for wiping up oil and other things in the shop.  The durability is good when compared to similar products.  It is hard to compare prices these days as the sheets are different sizes, the rolls are labeled double, triple, giant, mega, etc.  However, when comparing price per roll to some other brands I have bought recently I think these are a pretty good value.I will be buying these again for my shop.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Product: Viva Multi-Surface Cloth TaskSize Kitchen Paper Towels, White, 24 CountThis paper towel is Viva’s general purpose paper towel, it is not their cloth type paper towel. It is not as soft, but works better for wiping up or cleaning day-to-day surfaces.This paper towel is working great for my normal daily needs for a paper towel. It’s pretty absorbent. I’m not having any problems with lint when wiping down shiny surfaces like the front of my microwave. I don’t think it’s quite as thick as Bounty, but the price is a little less. I do find that the rolls last me longer than other paper towels in the same price range.It is mid-range in thickness and a bit on the rough side. It is lightly quilted, but has grooves over the entire surface which makes it good for cleaning up messes. These are task sized, so you can tear off the size you need, saving on your use.I’m happy with these for things like cleaning up messes and draining food. I don’t need fancy paper towels for those jobs.

I always need paper towels, especially because I have two cats who love to make a mess, so I was happy to have a chance to use and review Viva Multi-Surface Cloth TaskSize Kitchen Paper Towels, White, 24 Count.For the most part, I really like these Viva Paper Towels. They do an excellent job of cleaning up all types of messes (and my cats make plenty of messes) and can be rinsed and reused (a feature I really like when cleaning up the worst of my cats messes) – however the surface is a little rough compared to other paper towels. I had mixed feelings about the Task Size – it was a bit smaller than I would have liked and I had a hard time tearing off each sheet. Still, these are nice paper towels – strong and durable. And with twenty-four paper towels in a package, these will last me a long time – even with my cats!Viva Multi-Surface Cloth TaskSize Kitchen Paper Towels do a good job!

Not sure if these were a good deal or not. Their marketing has me confused. Maybe that is the goal.

This is a review of Viva Multi-Surface Cloth TaskSize Kitchen Paper Towels, White, 24 CountMost paper towels come as task-sized now so that's not such a big deal but it is great that these do come that way. Instead of wasting an entire, full-sized towel, you can rip off a smaller piece and do what you've got to do with it.These are two-ply so are more absorbent and stronger than your basic single-ply paper towel. These do not seem to be as thick or as absorbent as another popular paper towel on the market but these probably aren't as expensive either. They seem to be working well enough for me around the house for wiping down counters, cleaning windows and other lighter cleaning tasks.

We are really enjoying the Viva Multi Surface Task Size Paper Towels. Each sheet is perforated to about half the size of a regular paper towel. This gives you the option to use more or less! These work so much better on glass than ever before! That is such a huge plus! No lint left behind. No streaks and smears!On the down side, the rolls are a little smaller, BUT you absolutely use less so don’t be fooled by the size.We have had several small spills and cleanups where we normally would use 3-4 regular paper towels. With the new Viva Task Size, I use 1-2.Overall, we are quite pleased and will be purchasing again.

I wasn't sure why my current Viva paper towels were not good for mulit-use. I love the Signature brand of Viva, there is just something I love about the softness. They do sometimes, because they are so smooth, but push instead of soak. These have texture to them, so they will absorb more quickly, but they do not have the softness that is so recognizable with Viva. If you have ever used Viva, you can recognize them by touch, but with these Viva paper towels, you would not recognize them by touch. They are fine, good paper towels actually, but they aren't the special feel that I am used to from Viva.

These Viva Paper Towels are thick, strong, and absorbent. These aren't the super soft cloth-like towels; these are more like your standard paper towels. I like and prefer the towels that allow for half sheets- I don't go through them as fast. These are nice and I would buy them again- they work well to wipe us messes.

Bounty (Proctor and Gamble) has turned the covid era into the money making venture of a lifetime and is raking in huge record profits off their products.  I've searched for a replacement and find Viva to be of high quality and more affordable so they are now my paper towel supplier.  Even if Bounty lowers their prices, I will remember how they stuck it to the consumer and that goes for all Proctor and Gamble products.

Great price for a great product. No paper dust or shrapnel from these towels.

I love the absorbency and these paper towels in general

These paper towels really hold up to tough clean ups and don’t disintegrate when using them.  I keep these on repeat order because they hold up so well, I use less to do more.

I've used Viva Paper Towels for years! I have used several other brands of paper towels over time before deciding I liked Viva Brand more than others! I used the Viva Multi Purpose towels more for cleaning and the Signature Viva for all kinds of things!

Great product.

Always order this kind because they soak up a lot of liquids and are great paper towels. Well worth the money

This is what we use where I work.  They use them in the warehouse for everything.  Getting hard to find in the stores, so I found them here.  Only ones our workers want!

Soft just like a wash cloth. I love these and always have. I paint and these are so great to have a roll with me when I take my paints outside and paint nature.

Love how thick these paper towels are. They almost feel like cloth. They are very strong and absorbant. They are cheaper to order than what the stores sell them for.

Triple rolls that are actually triple

My local store is hit or miss with having these in stock. I was happy to find a bulk option here on Amazon. Nothing on the market compares to these. Strong but also Soft.  No shedding issues.  The best.

Brought to you by the same company that makes Kleenex facial tissue and Cottonelle toilet paper so they should know something about making paper products. This paper towel doesn't fall apart when it's soaked even when you're rubbing it against something abrasive like carpet. Perforated in the now standard half sheet size. Really good for cleaning. Almost feels wasteful if you're just using it to absorb a small spill and then throwing it away.

Good price and excellent product. These towels are heavy and absorbent as well as a good buy

The sheets are the perfect size and they pick up everything. I don't know where the have been all of my life, but I won't go back. We try to our paper towel use so these last a long long time.

Viva paper towels are my favorite and the price is remarkable

Nice and strong.

I love these paper towels, they work really well and hold up to big messes!

best towels for the money, absorbent, durable and easier to tear off sheets than the cloth.

Hands down my favorite paper towel!  Paper towels are expensive so at least spend your money on ones that you use less to do more (waaay less... waaay more)Be smart, save money, buy VivaYou can thank me later😇😇

I love the durable strength of viva.  It can dry out and be used again

I absolutely love the Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels! Not only are they super absorbent, but they are also incredibly durable. I can use them for all my cleaning needs around the house, from wiping down countertops to cleaning up spills. I highly recommend these paper towels to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile cleaning solution!

I'm always on the look-out for deals on items we use regularly. I am not partial to a specific brand on most household cleaning essentials. So I caught these on an Amazon promotion. They're paper towels. They do what paper towels are supposed to do. What else can I say?

I've used Viva paper towels for years. They are softer and more absorbent than higher-priced brands, and I like that you can just tear off half a sheet if that's what you need.

Love Viva. This is a good paper towel for the price.

I feel so nature girl when I use these. I prefer the ones that are actual cloths. I truly reuse them. I love sticking one on top of my faucet to dry and then use it again to polish my sink with a little bit of oil. I put a roll of it in my bathroom for guests.

It's a paper towel, excellent choice and way cheaper than those big box stores!

Very absorbant and sturdy. Don't need to use a lot for spills

Very soft

Love the thick cloth like feel of this towel. Can even use to wash my dishes.

I like how soft these paper towels are they the right size to clean little mouths!

There actually IS a difference between cleaning CLOTH and PAPER TOWEL, you can definitely rinse and reuse for things like warm wet compresses, something to cough into, light dusting, minor spills etc. just rinse out and use again till they eventually get worn and/or tear.They’re VERY soft, I’d use them over most brands for blowing noses, thick & absorbent, and honestly the only kind of “paper towel” I would bother spending money on rather than using clothes that have worn enough holes in them to just cut into rags to use for any good purpose for the cloth type.

Value value 👌

I recently purchased the Viva Multi-Surface Cloth Paper Towels, Task Size - 24 Super Rolls, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The quantity is impressive, and the quality lives up to the brand's reputation. The cloth-like texture feels sturdy and absorbs spills and messes effortlessly. With 81 sheets per roll, these paper towels last longer than traditional ones, making them perfect for various cleaning tasks around the house. They're gentle enough for delicate surfaces but still tough on stubborn stains. Overall, a fantastic value for the price, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and durable paper towels.

This brand of paper towels seems to have a tighter weave which makes them more like a cloth than a paper towel. I have not experienced any other brands having this aspect to them.

Very nice paper towels . Soft,  Strong and absorbent. Try them once you will never go back to regular paper towels

My fav!! Best Paper towels ever! Cloth ones though , not the regular from VIVA! Also last longer!!

Ordered these by accident now i get them on the regular bang bang! Love them

Always a good product

Sturdy and tough!! Great for cleaning up small messes!! Good on rougher stuff as well

Not bad at all. Well be buying these for now on I bet

Great quality product for a great price!

Excellent quality

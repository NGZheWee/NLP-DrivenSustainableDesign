The object of the action word is typically the action receiver.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide a structured list or bullet points grouping product features and affordances separately, ensuring clarity in distinguishing between features and affordances.\n\n# Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n- **Input:** \"The chair has adjustable height and comfortable cushioning. It allows users to sit for extended periods without discomfort.\"\n- **Output:**\n  - **Product Features:** \n    - Nouns: adjustable height, comfortable cushioning\n    - Linking Verbs: has (adjacent to 'adjustable height' and 'comfortable cushioning')\n  - **Product Affordances:**\n    - Action Verbs: allows (sit for extended periods)\n    - Derived Forms: comfortable\n\n(Real input examples should be longer and list more complex product features and affordances as identified using the outlined steps.)\n\n# Notes\n\nEnsure not to capture verbs that describe emotions or states of being unrelated to product actions. Focus on elements directly involving the product and its interaction capabilities.",

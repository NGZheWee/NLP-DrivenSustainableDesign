I was born and raised in Paraguay and it’s extremely insulting to see people appropriating something so sacred to us! First of all IT IS NOT a product from Argentina or Brazil. It was originated in Paraguay during the first big war, where the tribes called Guayakí (emphasized the í) used the leaves of the Yerba mate because of the high hydration properties as they didn’t have access to clean water. Later on it was adopted by other cultures, also big part of Argentina and Brazil used to be all part of Paraguay called “Rio de la plata” under Spain rule. Terere and mate is extremely sacred to Paraguayans and the fact that they're the less credited is extremely insulting!

Both of which gives me a powerful jolt of energy, it is more gradual then coffee but for people who don't consume caffeine regularly- you will feel it.I have been trying this on and off for about 2 months now. I can say with confidence that there is little to no caffeine compared to the other versions (same brand) I tried. Normally one tea bag would do the job and wake me up, however I have even used TWO teabags (supposedly 80 MG of caffeine) and feel nothing what-so-ever.The 2 stars are for :-The price point is great, the box of 25 tea bags cost more than this 75 tea bag.

This five pounds of loose tea is sold for only $.47 an ounce. The cheapest green tea from china sells for $.60, not organic not Fair Trade which makes this tea an excellent healthy option in USDA organic form. Guayusa has a smoother taste than Yerba Mate. Any food item sold directly by Amazon, not a third party means fresh due to high turn over. This is an excellent price especially when competition sells this tea for $9 in a 8oz bag.The first people to discover Yerba Mate were the Guarani (pronounced wa-ra-nee). Their traditional homeland in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil overlaps the home range of wild yerba mate. I was born in a tea family. I drink over ten cups of tea every single day. I have been doing that for decades and decades. USDA organic, a certified USDA, Kosher, Fair Trade. Those three items ORGANIC, KOSHER, FAIR TRADE, guarantee a superior product, fair treatment of workers and environment. I drink many different teas and even the cheapest USDA organic, Kosher but not Fair Trade tea like Davidson's green tea sells for $10 a pound and once again not a Fair Trade ingredient. Amazon has great pricing. To get the most out of my tea, I do not treat these teas like I do with the real expensive teas since I drink so many cups of it every single day. Instead I make these teas in coffee percolator since I like my tea really hot and I hate waste. Percolator get all its colors out but I treat the black tea differently.A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle -- this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling.Remember it is only a tea, there is no antioxidants, no youth, no energy, no nutritious stimulants except caffeine which is natural ingredient and all other miracles claimed by all those producers of Yerba Mate especially WEIGHT LOSS are all marketing tools. The only weight loss that I know of is exercise and cutting calories consumption unless one is truly genetically or chronically sick. These producers need to remove those claims since it is very misleading. Antioxidants are the most misused word in health and diet. There is not even a measurement of such ingredient called antioxidant in any food NUTRITION FACT table. It is a tea not a supplement either. I do not consume prescriptions for any chronic condition, supplements, pills, process foods. Only in US with relaxed laws these producers are allowed such marketing. I drink coffee as well as many black teas and none are supplements either except sugar free drinks. These are five star teas. Support those farmers through Fair trade or Fair for Life, certified programs and get yourself a nature given drink just like other plants that I use as tea when infact others only use as a food ingredient in their cooking but ignore the marketing.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This is where I was first disappointed, the majority of the contents were basically powdered. Yerba Mate should be fine put not powdery. I had to step back because of the plume of powdery dust that filled the air as I was pouring it into my container. Already let down I tried to stay positive and continued on. Next I smelled the Mate like I would with any other type of tea to get more of an appreciation for the tea, again I was disappointed. This did not smell like the typical pure Mate's I get from local and online suppliers. Again, I tried to stay positive and remain hopefully that the taste would be the decider. The following morning I brewed some of the Mate, left it on the light side to make sure that I can fully appreciate the tea and adjust the quantity to my specific taste. Once again I was let down. With all other pure Mate's I have had in the past they had a grassy, light lemony/citrus taste to them (which I love). This has a roasted nutty and dark taste to it, not completely unpleasant but I do not seek out the taste.Overall I am extremely disappointed. The only reason it got a 3/5 instead of 2/5 is because the cost is so cheap that I don't feel like I wasted too much money on it. I would not suggest this product to a friend or family.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

I take them to school for situations when I need a caffeine kick (like staying awake in a boring lecture). I bought the loose leaf version because I can control the sugar content of the drink. I found the flavor pleasant and mild. I know some reviewers are complaining about the taste - perhaps they used boiling water to steep the mate. If you use high temperature to steep the drink it will be bitter and awful. Also, some reviewer are complaining of the dusty residue. It does appear a couple of minutes after you steep the mate. It did not really bother me though. I would like to point out the the leaves themselves are not dusty. It's only after you steep them that you'll see the residue. The main issue that I have with the product is it puts me to sleep instead of keeping me awake. I started nodding off 10 minutes after I took the last sip during the first time I drank it. I thought it was an isolated incident then I tried a week after and I had the same result. Maybe the loose leaf version has some compounds that affect me a certain way - it is unfiltered and unrefined compared to the soda version. I'll keep buying the Guayaki soda drink for the caffeine. I just want to share my experience - it might have the same effect on you.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

As a fan of traditional South American beverages, I can attest to the genuine flavor and aroma of this Yerba Mate.The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the tea bags fresh and preserving their flavor. However, the only downside I found was the lack of a string for easy removal of the tea bag. While it's a minor inconvenience, having a string attached would make the brewing process more convenient, especially when using a mug or cup.Overall, I would still highly recommend this Yerba Mate Tea for its taste, quality, and energizing effects.

What I will comment on first is ease of use:  Drop two bags in my large coffee cup put a little water on it then swirl to get the teabags wet (dummy water thing) and let sit for about a minute.  Then put the 170 degree or so water on it.  let it steep.  Enjoy. When you finish, you can put another round of water on it to get a weaker cup (I have gone three rounds on the two bags but prefer to end it at two YMMV).Effects:  As you have read or may not have read, this stuff has a caffeine content above tea but below coffee and has other components involved here as well (Theobromine et.al) so as a life long coffee drinker I can tell you that this will produce a much more elegant buzz that what Mistress Coffee provides.  I feel alert, focused, and very awake without the shakes and stomach upset that coffee sometimes does to the drinker.  I can also tell you that my appetite doesn't go away but I'm not digging thru my desk looking for snack machine change.  I can hold out till lunch.  The after effects are minimal.  I dont crash as hard (if you want to call it crash now) as you do when coffee wears off.  It ""ramps up then gently ramps back down""  Which is why I suppose folks drink the stuff in a weaker form all day long.  You keep getting weaker and weaker doses so that you gently come back down.  Does it have the same ""gotta go to the potty"" effect as coffee...kinda...sorta...not as pronounced.In conclusion:  If you are like me and trying to wean off the coffee and tea just isn't cutting it, this is a very good way to get introduced into the world of yerba mate without all the ritual stuff that you see associated with yerba mate (that slurping sound that is popular with the gourd/bombilla/knit cap in the middle of summer crowd drives me freaking nuts!).  If you like it then you can buy all the stuff and stand on the corner with a gourd or use a french press like I plan on doing.Enjoy your mate.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Their cans of mate are great and I have consumed many of them. I have also recently moved to traditional preparation: using a gourd and bombilla. I think this is fun although you have to get accustomed to the taste which is pretty strong and bitter--at first. However, I have found that the taste is acquired.My wife and I really like mate. Guayaki's products are probably pretty comparable to ""top of the line."" However, there ARE cheaper alternatives like Eco Teas, which is also organic and fair trade (whatever that means ...  I should look it up). I am going to review what I think are the PROS and CONS of mate AS A FORMER ENERGY DRINK CONSUMER (I'll never go back).My OWN experience:PROS--Mental alertness enhanced--Awakens me and actually makes me feel energetic (AS OPPOSED TO jittery and wired)--Enhances my mood. Let me elaborate: I am more introverted than not. When I have consumed some mate I actually feel more positive and inclined to smile and say hi to people, even across a room. I have really liked that.--I feel the claims to ""aids elimination"" are true. Things tend to keep moving as they should!CONS--Makes my urine smell. :) Like unto asparagus, I have noticed that drinking mate adds a certain ... smell ... to urine. Don't get me wrong though, not a big deal! Just kind of funny and would, well, technically fall under ""cons.""--The primary thing: I have seemed to notice that if I go a day and a half or so without drinking it I develop a headache. (I DID NOT personally get this with energy drinks for whatever reason.) I am currently doing a experiment to determine if mate ""withdrawal"" is, in fact, the reason. I'll have to update this later with what I have found.That's the main reason I brought it from five stars down to four. I don't like ANYTHING that creates or causes any form of bodily dependence. I spoke of my headaches to a friend of mine, an avid mate drinker, and he also told me, ""Oh yeah, If I were to stop drinking mate I'd have a headache for a week!""Hope the review helps!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I like tea, but I have never been a fanatic about it. The blog stated that the actual loose tea from South America is both inexpensive and POTENT (meaning strong in the effect) vs. the tea sold in the states. I just looked this up on Amazon, saw this was loose tea, it was only $11 (& change + $5 in S&H) so I gave it a whirl. I brew it in my coffee pot, & I usually will circulate it through twice to increase the strength of it. I'll set it up at night (while I'm awake) & brew the first pot, & then prior to going to bed I put the tea back in the reservoir, & set the ""Brew Delay"" to begin at about 3:45am in the morning before I get up & get ready to go workout. It works well for my digestive system, gives me energy w/out the crash, & I'll add some sugar free French vanilla creamer & Stevia to it sometimes just to give it a little creaminess that makes it ""yummy"" (for me). The downside to brewing this in your coffee pot is that if you fill up your reservoir for 12 cups of coffee - by the time it finishes brewing you will be down to about 10 (I surmise it is due to the absorption from the dry loose tea sitting in the filter). I am on my 2nd bag in less than 2 weeks, but then again, I am quite active and many times I work at a clinic during the day and then out of a fire dpt at night as a Paramedic so I like to sip it throughout the duration of the day (depending on my schedule). It also doesn't give me a ""sour stomach"" (when empty) like coffee does. I'd recommend giving it a try!! ...& the shipping was pretty fast!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Try a smaller count option first if you want to get some mate (you don't want to get stuck with 74 bags of something you hate). If you love mate and don't do loose leaf, this is a great option.For people just getting into mate, this is a great option because it is in bags and not loose leaf. Also good for having some mate at work or on the go because you don't have to have a little gourd stuffed with steaming hot water and a handful of mate with a bombilla.There are better tasting mates out there, but this is a very good option for the price and quantity. 75 bags!? You won't find many options out there with that many bags for this price. They are not individually wrapped, so you might get a little dust from the bag, but that's partly contributed to the lower cost since they don't have to package each little bag. Additionally, the tea bags are just that, tea bags. No strings or little tabs to lift the tea bag out. If you hate that, Guayaki makes individually wrapped tea bags with strings, they're just a little more expensive. Not much though, since Guayaki is the more affordable tea bag option for mate. If you're super serious about mate, loose leaf will always be the cheapest option. I've got a 500 gram bag of Rosamonte that I've been working on for the past 3-4 months at work (at ~3g per serving, that's ~167 servings, 30 servings a month, the bag will last just over 5 months).ProsPrice and quantity are greatTaste is goodBagged, not loose leafConsNo string or tab on the bagsNot individually wrappedNot the greatest mate known to man (but still good)",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This was my second loose tea leaf purchase (I normally buy tea in bags) and the other loose leaf I bought (different brand, different site) had no fine powder.  So when I make the tea I get a lot of powder in my cup.  Not a huge deal, but I would prefer if the leaves were big enough not to leak through.  I'll probably buy this one more time & if I get the same thing I'll go back to the guayaki mate tea bags, which I love, I just wish they sold in bulk because I run out so quickly!!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

They are separate tea bags in a foil package that keeps them fresh.  I usually use two tea bags when I make my mate, but it still lasts a long time.  The tea tastes great and not bitter.  But of course, it all depends on the brewing time so keep that in mind.  The longer you brew it results in bitterness.  Also, the temperature of water also is a factor that can affect the taste.  I heat the water until its just about to boil.  That is the temperature that prevents the bitter taste.  Try this and enjoy it!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

This had good reviews which is why I chose this brand.I measure my blood sugar often and test what effects various foods and drinks have on it. - I'm prediabetic and trying to reverse it.  If I drink this tea alone on an empty stomach it will lower my blood sugar by approximately 14 points over the course of the following hour from when I first start sipping it.  For example, I would go from 100 down to 86. If I drink it with a meal it seems to suppress my blood glucose values slightly compared to when I eat the same food without drinking the Yerba Mate.I have consumed hundreds of cups over the last year or so and it has never once made me jittery.  The most I would have in a day is probably 2 tea bags.  I typically have 2 cups of decaf coffee first thing in the AM, then I have a cup or two of this tea after that.I will use one bag twice if I am having a second cup right after the first one.  The second cup will obviously be a little weaker but it is still satisfying.The tea seems to help calm me and focus me and help me get into ""the zone"" when I am doing creative work.  The effect is not strong.  It is very subtle.  So, don't drink it expecting a dramatic relaxation effect.I absolutely love the flavor.  It is very mild in my opinion.  To me it seems like the texture of the tea is almost as if you had a very small amount of butter in the tea cup.  (Not the taste of butter - just the texture - like silky almost)  I think it is just lovely.I have not been able to source this locally.  Someone local probably sells it but I haven't found it yet.  So I always buy it through Amazon.  It always arrives promptly in good condition.The large foil bag that these tea bags ship in is easy to tear.  You will probably want to have an airtight container of some kind to store your tea bags in.  The bag they ship in will probably end up tearing wide open on you before you get half way through the bag.I strongly recommend this tea.  Drinking this has become a daily habit for me.  At this point it looks like a permanent habit too assuming the quality never diminishes and assuming the price remains affordable.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's actually related to holly.Second, it contains vitamins, minerals, and more antioxidants than green tea (contrary to one misguided reviewer on here claiming that yerba only yields caffeine, which is not even close to the truth.)Yerba mate contains caffeine, theophylline (vasodilator) and theobromine (found in chocolate), but most who drink it find they do not experience the jitters, acid stomach or other negative aspects of coffee or green tea, myself included.I have found that yerba acts as a natural asthma medication for me, keeping my lungs open and giving me an energetic boost without feeling hyper, sweaty or keeping me from sleeping. In fact, I often take yerba before bed to keep the lungs happy all night and sleep like a baby. I cannot consume coffee or any tea (black or green) after noon and sleep at all, not even one cup. So clearly yerba is a special herb.It brews well in tea bags, in a traditional gourd and bombilla setup or in a French press.  Apparently in South America, they have it cold and brewed in fruit juice and similar things for a refreshing summer beverage. I cannot wait to try that! I've made yerba overnight in the fridge, cold-brewed, and it was delicious. Strong, but not bitter at all.Just wanted to correct some misinformation on here and share some of the reasons why yerba mate has been a treasured part of my life for 3 decades and counting!Original Review:I was introduced to Guayaki Yerba Mate by a tenant of mine in Los Angeles. He used to chuck a few tea bags into his 1.5 liter water bottle, shake it up and sipped it throughout the day for energy and the lovely flavor. I tried it and have been a huge devotee ever since. I like it sweetened with a touch of liquid stevia and I brew mine quite strong (so strong, you cannot see through the water, lol) because I adore the rich, smokey flavor which only seems to deepen when you add a little sweetness. I also noticed that while I do feel a little energy lift from it, I never feel jittery nor has it ever disrupted my sleep when I drink it in the evening. It honestly seems to help my digestion as well, I feel like it kindles the digestive flames somehow, but that might just be my own experience.Wonderful flavor, unobtrusive energy and a healthy substitute for coffee or ""energy drinks"".",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I also purchased some Red Rooibos as well to compare the two. I have to say that while I did enjoy the Red Rooibos, it had that very distinct tea flavor, and just didn't quite hit the spot.The Yerba Mate came in a few days later, so yesterday was the first time I got to try it as a morning coffee substitute. While again, it's not going to taste like coffee, this stuff was much more like green tea, which isn't bad either, but definitely not like coffee.  I normally add a bit of heavy cream to my coffee, so I did that as well, and found I enjoyed it much more that way.Claims that the smaller amount of caffeine being enough (95mg in coffee vs 40mg in this product), held true for me, as well as the claim that it felt more like a consistent energy, rather than the hard hit that coffee can give, and then fades.Yesterday I had to get up at 5:30 am and drive 2 hours to get to a 4 hour conference. I then had to run a bunch of errands, followed by a 2 hour drive home. After 6 hours of sleep, things didn't seem promising. However, I found that I really wasn't very tired at all throughout the day, and it wasn't until around 3-4, after eating a solid meal, that I kind of started feeling the energy drain, but I was still pretty good all the way up to my evening exercises, after which, I just crashed, but it was 10 pm by then.So, given the initial trial run, I'd say the Yerba Mate IS a good substitute. Granted, it could be a whole fluke of a day, but for now, my opinion is that the taste is pleasant, and the slow and steady energy buzz is actually preferable to coffee. As far as claims of being a mild appetite suppressant, I haven't noticed that.Just a final heads up: a quick Google shows that there's a lot of pros and cons about Yerba Mate, including that it's better for you than coffee, with lots of vitamins and nutrients and anti inflammatory effects,  but also studies saying it can put you at a higher risk for some cancers if too much is ingested. I honestly haven't looked very far into it, but will be doing so once I'm done with this. Just so you know!UPDATE: Oct. 7, 2019 - Yerba Mate has consistently held up as a caffeine substitute for me. I now drink 2 tea bags added to 16 oz hot water and about 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream in the morning. My energy levels are comparable to coffee, and I'm usually not hungry till 11-12pm. I got this because it's not supposed to stain your teeth like coffee does, and I can say my teeth haven't stained any.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

And that this could POTENTIALLY mean bad news for bones, teeth, and brain function.  I will leave you to do your own research on that, as I am generally NOT a worrier about such things (so I know how frustrating it is to hear yet another possible health risk.)  Still (obviously) I saw enough reason to be at least ""concerned"" at the levels of fluoride in black and green (and decaf) tea.  This led me to two new products: White Tea and Yerba Mate.Yerba Mate is a loose leaf traditional (south american) tea-like product that comes in many different forms.  And it doesn't have high concentration of fuoride in its leaves.  So, I tried it.I heard that it tastes ""grassy"" or like hay.  Some say it taste earthy.  To be sure, it doesn't taste like green or black tea (but more like green than like black).  It is unique.  I didn't find it ""grassy.""  I found it to have a pleasant, non-bitter taste.  Not like tea, as I said, but pleasant enough.I prepared it by putting it in my Mr. Coffee coffemaker.  FIrst batch tasted like coffee a bit.  I cleaned the coffee maker and tried again.  This time i got a pleasant brew.  I tried to make it STRONGER, the next time and I found no real difference.  So, I went back to normal brew.  It will look a little like green tea in looks, but it's unique taste was unmistakeable. I enjoyed it. My wife complained it had an odd taste.  However, my wife is self-proclaimed picky eater.  Even if she loves some recipe/item, then later finds out it has XYZ (whatever item she doesn't think she likes) then see will change her mind and never eat that food that she said that she loved.  All that to say this: If you are AOK with knowing this will have a unique taste, then you may just find it a good drink for you. If you are pretty picky about tastes that are new, then you likely will not like it.For me, I have to give it 5 stars.  Oh, to be sure, I like White Tea better than Yerba Mate, but it is a good product and worthy of 5 stars.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

He bought the stuff as an iced tea from Whole Foods. I tried it and it did provide an energy boost, but not a ""crazy"" one.After some research, I found out that as a ballpark figure, Yerba Mate provides ~1/3 (one third) of the caffeine of a cup of coffee. That's perfect for me, since I don't always want as much caffeine as a full cup of coffee, but I do want *some.* I did some research, and it turns out they don't just sell it at Whole Foods in pre-made iced tea. So I bought it on Amazon.== Taste ==Yerba Mate has a smoky flavor to it. If you like drinking green tea or other teas without adding lots of sugar, you'll like this tea.== Price point ==... is absolutely ridiculous -- you get 75 tea bags. That lasts a long time.== No string attached ==If it's an issue for you, the tea does come in bags, but it doesn't have a string for easily pulling out the bag. It's really not very difficult to pull it out with a spoon, but it is worth mentioning since most people are used to having a string attached to their tea bags.== Good hot or cold ==At first, I had this tea mostly hot-brewed, and it was quite good. But recently, my girlfriend and I have started adding about 5-10 bags to a large pitcher of water and letting it soak in the fridge for at least 12 hours. It tastes **awesome.** So while Yerba Mate is good for hot tea, it is even better for cold tea. Some teas just taste better cold -- actually, that's true of food in general. Some things taste better hot; some better cold. Black tea is the one most commonly used in iced teas, like Snapple. You can drink it warm, but it's far more popular cold.I highly recommend this product, and I also highly recommend that you try using it to brew iced tea.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

After having downed energy drinks twice a day for a few years, switching to coffee to try to get an equal, albeit uneven, fix, I'm happy to have found yerba mate tea.What I love most about the Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea is the elevated feel and focus the tea provides through its 40 mg of caffeine per bag without the traditional shaky hands and anxiety I would get from coffee and energy drinks. It's a buzz without being a wreck.For comparisons, Starbucks coffee (venti Americano) doses you with about 300 mg of caffeine though independent reports I've seen have shown it to be upwards of 400 mg+ depending on where you go. Energy drinks typically range from 77 mg (8 oz Red Bull) to 240 mg per can (16 oz Rockstar Zero Carb) with added, and unnecessary to get you going, things like taurine that are questionable for your health.With yerba mate tea, you can stack your caffeine to your content. Want the buzz of an energy drink without the nerves? Put four bags in and let it steep for 10 minutes. Works like a charm every time for me.It's worth noting that the U.S. government recommends not consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine per day so going overboard with two ventis from Starbucks or two Rockstars can have potential consequences. Beyond the simple enjoyable taste of yerba mate, the stackable nature is what I enjoy most.For the price, you can't go wrong! Four bags (160 mg of caffeine) gets you close to 19 cups of tea. When you compare that to $4 for a venti Americano or $3 for an energy drink, it's pretty apparent that yerba mate is also the more economical choice of the three.Check out energy fiend dot com to get the scoop on caffeine levels in each drink. I know I'm addicted to the alertness caffeine provides, as I'm sure most of us are, but there is no excuse not to be safe about how much we take in each day.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I used to brew him other brands of Yerba Mate teas when we lived in San Francisco but could not find any strong ones in our area of Sam diego now . After looking around I came across this loose leaf tea one and honestly it’s been great , the taste is strong and not flavorful  as the Can ones but it also does not say it is lol , what I do is buy sweet flavor loose teas at my local farmers market that don’t have caffeine so I don’t add more and give the man a heart attack , also can use tea puches and ass a bit of honey or sugar to each it’s own for some sweetness . Works great and he has more flavor options than the canned ones , also Have the option to make it as strong or light  as he wants with many different flavor options , make a big pitcher that last all week and is ready to make it iced in a hydro flask . Overall GREAT purchase , money saver .",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green ""tea"" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

One day I came across an article talking about the benefits of this particular tea.+ Loaded with all kinds of vitamins, mineral, and antioxidants+ Boost your immune system+ Help increase energy and mental focus (mainly due to the caffeine)I’ve only had this warm.  I prepare it by heating up water then throwing 1-2 packets into my giant mug, then slowly stir it for about 2-3 minutes.  My first few sips of it weren’t bad, but not great.  Overtime though I did like the grassy/earthy taste it has.  Noticeably different than any other varieties of tea I’ve ever had!  If you’re not into such a strong taste, try diluting it a bit!Whenever I drink Yerba Mate Tea I definitely notice a decent boost of mental clarity, but different than if I were to just drink a ton of coffee and get a huge rush from the caffeine.  Furthermore since there is much less caffeine in Yerba Mate Tea (40mg) compared to coffee (100-120mg) I don’t ever experience a crash from the caffeine and I feel alright drinking this at night and not have to worry about staying up all night.For 75 bags the price isn’t too shabby, but if you’re strictly after caffeine content I probably look to a combination of coffee and green / black tea for the best bang for your buck.  As for those seek a little more variety in their caffeine, this is a wonderful selection!",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

When my coffee consumption started to get out of hand, I was looking for an alternative that didn't leave me crashing in the afternoon. A friend suggested I try Yerba tea because it has been around for hundreds of years, is a natural source of caffeine, has digestive benefits, all without the afternoon crash.  At the time, I could only find Yerba tea in health food stores. Each time I ran out of a box (usually around 20 tea bags), I would have to trek to the store for more. I'm not a fan of the Yerba teas with added stevia, vanilla, or the ""smoked"" flavor. When I found this Guayaki brand on amazon, I thought 75 tea bags for $11 would certainly sacrifice flavor for cost. But I was wrong! I love the tea - and it has successfully kept me from returning to my coffee over-addiction :)  The tea steeps for about 5 minutes. I put the tea bag into my mug and use my Keurig machine for instant hot water. I like to add some honey, and occasionally some milk or cream. By itself, it can be a little strong on an empty stomach, but green tea is also too strong for me on an empty stomach. I never have that coffee crash, and my mind actually feels clearer than with coffee.I would highly recommend this Guayaki Yerba Mate tea - for the taste & for the money! It's a great deal!!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Bear McBear,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2013","For $11.25 or 15 cents per packet at time of purchase for a total of 75 bags of tea this is a great deal.When I look for tea I generally look for three things: price, taste, and health benefits. Guayaki Yerba Mate tea is very cheaply priced online as described earlier and all you have to do is walk the aisles at your grocery store to see that. In terms of taste, it is actually derived from a plant of the same name in South America and is actually a species of Holly. It is somewhat like an earthier green tea with a slight (pleasant) bite depending on how you brew it.Health wise, I drink it every morning and it helps wake me up without the rise and fall that regular coffee provides, and like most fresh brewed hot tea I find it personally mellows me out and helps me get ready to face the challenges of the day. Additionally, it has helped regulate my digestion and overall just made me feel slightly better overall. When I got a head cold a steaming cup of Yerba Mate helped clear up my sinuses although I've found most hot teas will do the same, though I will qualify these statement with the fact that I am not a doctor and haven't done any studies, these are just my personal observations.I definitely plan on rebuying this tea when my current supply runs out.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and ""on edge"" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in

Lately, we have been using this loose leaf mate exclusively as our first tea of the morning, and, prior to any coffee. I really like the flavor -- rich and full. If there's more left, as usually the case in the glass pot I use, I pour over more hot water, use this way -- and/or use the leftovers to make a great iced tea, sweetened or unsweetened. I find that mate' is far gentler on my stomach and likewise, on the nervous system, than our good ol' coffee we love. Have reduced my coffee from two to one rich cup later in morning.

I started drinking it to replace coffee about 6 months ago and this stuff is beyond what I expected. I've even managed to lose about 10 lbs because of it! It keeps me awake and active through the day without the uncomfortable jitters and sugar crashes that came as a result of over consumption of coffee. I've tried two different brands now and guayakí is my favorite so far. If you have never tried it I suggest trying it in a can before you dive in and buy the loose leaf. The loose leaf is by far the better value (even better than the tea bags) but has a little more of an earthy flavor. I've never been a huge fan of tea but I can't get enough of this stuff. It is seriously the best. If you are skeptical please take this review as your extra push to give it a try you won't regret it!!,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I have been an avid coffee drinker for over a decade, and as I have gotten older it has started to give me some stomach issues due to it's acidity. I was looking for a switch because I still love having a cup of something warm in the morning. This was the perfect substitute as it also gave me a bit of a caffeine kick.To brew I use my coffee maker like normal but don't put any coffee beans in. I put a travel mug underneath with two bags and set the alarm for the AM. I let it steep for 10 minutes or so then add a bit of agave and lemon. Easy on the stomach, tastes great, gives me a caffeine kick and I know I am getting a bunch of antioxidants in the morning.

From what I've read the chemical make up is different in Yerba Mate (YM) compared to caffeine in other drinks.What I absolutely love about YM is that it gives a slight energy boost & even a happiness without the jittery feeling & you won't have a crash after an hour or so as with regular caffeinated drinks. Don't misunderstand though, it doesn't bring you up if you are sad. I've tried triple doses to test this but on a regular day it adds a bit of a skip to your step. :)The flavor isn't much to be desired but add a little local honey (which is extremely good for fighting allergies) & it will grow on ya.I do not ever want to be without my YM.

Usually when I wake up I drink it hot with no sugar, and it gives me a nice boost in the day without giving me a jittery feeling.  When it's hot, I make a pitcher of this iced, with sugar, a spoonful of rosewater, and a squeeze of lime. Yeah, it's not traditional at all, but it is so good! :)This package contains 75 teabags.  The bags don't have strings and are not individually packaged, which I like because it cuts down on waste.  If you know what mate tastes like and drink it regularly, this is an economical purchase.  If you haven't tried mate before, I'd suggest getting a smaller sized pack at first because it doesn't taste like tea.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I use it occasionally in place of coffee. It may be an acquired taste, as it taste like liquid grass from your yard to me. However I steep two bags in a cup of hot water for several minutes. Squeeze out the water and add a little bit of milk. The Taste is not terribly objectionable it's just different. However the desired effect for me is to have a caffeine boost or a little bit of stimulant boost. This will do that because it has caffeine in it, however the way it works is not the sudden onset of the jitters like a strong cup of coffee can do. This is more gradual and without really a crash when it wears off.

This gives me the little kick I need to get going in the morning! Because I'm not a fan of the taste plain, I usually put some Stevia in a hot brew or ice it with some lemonade or other flavors. Tastes just like the what you would buy in the store. I don't use the traditional gourd, but have reausable cheese-cloth tea bags that I brew them in for about 15 minutes. Depending on how strong you want it, I add about 1 TBSP. Great price for a LOT of tea! It is REALLY fined grained, some parts are powdery, so I would recommend cheese cloth straining to get the bits out. I ordered this a month ago drinking almost every day and still have barely made a dent. Absolutely recommend.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It might be useful to infuse cider or wine but I have not tried this.  But as a drink by itself I found it watery and insipid.,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

I would happily drink it any time or day, and it might even start to push my old favorite Early Grey out on occasion.Vanilla chai is excellent for warm pick me ups in place of earl grey",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Typically, 70% dark chocolate is as dark as I enjoy eating.  I still love baked goods so I am experimenting with recipes that are gluten free/low carb and that is where this extra dark chocolate comes in.  I love the fact that it is organic, fair trade, and non-gmo......excellent qualities to start with!  It is smooth and creamy.  I can't give it 5 stars (which is = 'I love it') because it is still too dark for me to want to nibble on it, but I have found it to be great in recipes, especially when I sweeten it up with erythritol.  If you are a person who enjoys this dark of chocolate, you will absolutely enjoy this!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Moon,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2015","These arrived well insulated and nothing was broken. It was perfect. We had planned on giving these out and the quality was, as always, fantastic. We love Theo's dark chocolates because the darkness, while strong, never really tastes bitter or sweet. The chocolate is smooth and full of great flavor. Just a little bit will be enough to satisfy you and a bar could last you a good while. It is a favorite in our house and I am so glad to find that amazon sells these bars. I was also very happy to see there wan'st a crazy mark up these, if anything i think i even found that the case was slightly cheaper than had I bought from the theo's website.

The protagonist drank this all the time. So I bought it from the UK and I love it. Here's what happens when you drink this tea. It goes in your mouth kind of watery with a bit of (I'm having some now so I had to stop for a sip to get this right) peppermint flavor, and then about 2 seconds after you swallow it, the back of your throat literally is coated with a deep, rich delicious licorice flavor. It's kind of addicting, waiting for that wonderful licorice to just fill my taste buds with its richness. You won't be sorry if you try this.

It really is good. Nice flavor and it does remind me of Aveda tea but at a much better price. I've noticed that this brand is hit-or-miss with the strength of a flavor and this is one of the better ones. I recommend trying it without any sweetener first.Its actually better without. So great for someone staying away from sugar and still wanting flavor.,1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I use coconut oil as a deep conditioning treatment for my hair. I simply slather it on, massage my scalp, give my hair enough time to slurp it up, and then wash out with a gentle, all-natural conditioner. This coconut oil is of very high quality and has given me amazing results. The health and strength of my hair has significantly improved, and notice a lot of new hair growth. The rest of my hair has grown quite noticeably. Even though I think this is a wonderful product, I didn't re-purchase because I found Nature's Way to be less expensive/same prince for twice the amount of product - and the oil is just as good, if not a little better. The one thing I definitely like about this coconut oil better is the jar. Very nice, safe packaging and leaves me with a cute jar when the coconut oil is gone.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

Seibold,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020","I love they use glass.  I've bought coconut oil in plastic, which I hate, not only because plastic is destroying the planet but there is no way to get the last of the product out of a plastic jar.  I can put Dr. Bronner's coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds and melt the remaining oil and use it.  If I try that with plastic, the plastic meltws and folds up into a mess, and I'm afraid to eat the oil because of the plastic.  It's crazy though that those who use plastic, use an excellent cap that is totally unnecessary for a plastic bottle but it would be great if Dr. Bronners would use that kind of cap.  Bronners uses a cap that would work well on a plastic bottle but prevents the beautiful glass bottle they use from being a good storage container.  I ended up taking the cap used on plastic and replaced the cheap cap Bronner uses.  Bronner ought to use a cap with a seal inside the cap so it can be screwed down tight so the consumer can reuse the excellent glass bottle.  Maybe they could swap all their cheap caps to the plastic company and have the plastic company send them their excellent caps, which serve no function on a plastic bottle but would turn Bronner's glass bottles into excellent storage containers.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

It's just the 4 of us at home.If you make ONE change this year for your health, START USING COCONUT OIL!This oil tastes authentic on its own and makes foods taste amazing – adds a nice moisture to meats when cooking. Don't drain off the coconut fat when the food is done – it's supposed to be that way, so eat it up! I'm proud to enjoy GOOD FAT this much.The whole kernel is best for you.Put some in different containers throughout your home (glass or BPA-free), so it's always within arms reach – you'll use it if you can find it. Bring it with you on trips so you can use it always. I don't skip a day!What we use it for: Eat, Drink, ApplyIncreases stamina and energy. My 20 year old son uses this for brain and body health – workouts and lifting. Weight lifters secret.Muscle aches and pains (helps naturally detox, heal and replenish the body)Calms you down to sleepCooking meats, fish, eggs, and veggiesDetoxes and kills candidaWeight loss – keeps you full longer.Oil Pullling to detox mouth, clean and whitens teethAs a carrier and massage oil with Essential Oils – bring with you to a massage.Acne Potion (1 part baking soda for PH to 1 part coconut oil for moisture and healing + several drops of tea tree oil) – OMG my chronic acne is almost gone and it's been a week only!!!ADHD, memory issues, and good brain fats – prevents Alzheimers (Add some to hot coffee or tea) – Melts in heatAnxiety – Gives your body's cells the fats it need to fight off cortisol-stress hormones.Skin healing and psoriasis (people & animals) – my son gets a heat rash on his inner arm because he sweats at night.

I contacted Dr. Bronners about the brown discoloration as I have bought this item many times through the years, but hadn't seen the brown before. I received a very quick response and no further updates is good news, as if there does turn out to be evidenceof an issue after I open the jar, I'll update my review if Amazon Allows: ""Please rest assured that sediment is normal, and can sometimes be a golden yellow, or even brown color. Any virgin coconut oil that is made using a dry process, including Dr. Bronner’s,  has visible sediment in the oil as it comes from the expeller press. Each batch will vary, meaning some may have more sediment than others, and some may not have sediment at all. That sediment is usually filtered out in a multi-stage filter process. Since we air-dry the coconut flesh at temperatures around 220 C, some caramelization occurs during the drying and makes the sediment slightly brownish. When you taste it you’ll notice a slight caramel flavor. In the past we’ve occasionally had slippage of the very fine sediment through the filtration system. That’s what you see at the bottom of the jar. It’s similar to the kind of sediment you may see in a virgin olive oil, or other “native oils"" when you put them in the fridge. Also, gray translucent spots are also normal. These are natural occurring shadows that are present in Coconut Oil. Sometimes they also appear in a honeycomb pattern.""In any case, I've always been pleased with this product and love that the packaging is nontoxic and sustainable.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I have used it for years and will not buy anything else. It is pure and Excellent for so many different uses. I use it as a moisturizer, for bug bites, insect repellent, hair conditioner, makeup remover, leather moisturizer, cooking, in smoothies, you name it. My son is a Teenager and has some acne. He started using it at night as a moisturizer because the acne medication was drying out his skin. It has worked wonders for his skin! He said it is So soothing and the acne is gone! He was able to stop using the medication and just uses the coconut oil. Most people wouldn’t think of putting an oil on your face but Dr. Bronner’s unrefined is just that, unrefined and Full of nutrients. It may have some course pieces from time to time but that is because it is pure, no additives. My most recently  purchased jar is so smooth and melts into the skin like butter! Absolutely incredible and soothing! Love this stuff!",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

After loving the first batch I ordered, which had a very predominant rose flavor, I ordered a 3-pack of the same tea and it tastes completely different! This time, only the chamomile comes through, and honestly just I’m not a big fan of chamomile. The very reason I ordered this tea was for its rose flavor that originally far outshined the chamomile. Makes me wonder if the company behind this brand has adjusted its formulations or raw material sourcing to reduce costs, like so many companies do when they grow. I want to love this brand, but I’m very disappointed by this discovery and regret my purchase. Probably will not explore the other Pukka varieties as I’d intended to do.",-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

This is with all my orders not just this tea. In this case, I ordered a multipack of the Love tea (comes with 3 boxes), and I was shipped one. It was shipped with other heavy items I ordered separately and was smashed upon arrival. I have contacted amazon with each order and continue have these problems.

But I am a huge fan of Pukka brand and the types of teas it makes, which is why I bought Pukka Organic Love herbal tea. I love the chamomile, rose, and lavender combination. The perfect tea to enjoy with my husband and when friends and family visit. Great evening tea to relax and unwind after a long day. Smells amazing and tastes delicious. I highly recommend this particular tea and plan on purchasing more. It's caffeine free and smells incredible! Just place one tea bag in a cup, infuse it for up to 15 minutes and enjoy! Easy to open packaging and steeps well.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I haven't wanted to puke this badly since my 21st birthday. I've worked in kitchens while the grease traps are being cleaned, and that is a stench even morticians agree is worse than dead, rotting bodies, and I would gladly inhale that just to clear my nostrils of whatever was in this box. The stench is so undeniably virulent that it melted my brain and made me eloquent. I cannot stress enough just how horrible this product is. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep the contents of my stomach from rocketing out my face and spewing across the room like a scene from a movie about demonic possession. And I HATE wasting money, so I opened every individual flavour and gave them a whiff. Only one of them didn't make my stomach contract like I was hit by a linebacker. I adore tea almost as much as Uncle Iroh and was willing to try the one that didn't cause an immediate visceral reaction. That's how badly I wanted a cup of tea right now. I took two sips. It was disgusting. I feel as if I've been poisoned and I'm running a fever. I've never ordered tea online before and I never will again.

So when I found this lovely looking tea set, I was hoping to buy more for gifts. I use all of the different brands of teas that help relax and help sleep. I can eat almost anything and never have food or herbal allergies. But the first night when I tried the herbal tea in this set that is made to help sleep, I became violently ill within minutes of drinking it. I don't thorw up easily and have vomited about 6 times in half a century. But this tea had me exploding out of both ends with severe stomach pains. I could not get off of the toilet to vomit so while I was having explosive dairrhea, I was also projectile vomiting TEA and even the crackers I had eaten earlier in the day. I couldn't sleep for about 5 hours because of stomach pain and the explosions from either end. It was horrific! And then I noticed the name of the brand is PUKKA, and I am wondering if this is not some twisted joke by a psychopathic tea seller. I am seriously afraid to even try any of the other three tea sets I bought on Amazon, much less any more in this disgusting tea set.",0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

The only reservation I had was that there was an overpowering sent of black licorice and I am not a fan but I noticed that there was a pack that said peppermint licorice and I was thinking that was what I was smelling. I grabbed the elderberry pomegranate flavor and tasted it and all I can taste is the black licorice. If you like that flavor it's a dream come true but this is stuff of my nightmares. The packaging is beautiful though!,0,No strong positive or negative words found; marked as neutral.

The packaging looks nice and the flavors sounded good but they aren't.  Mediocre at best and the bags themselves are poorly made.  They often break in the cup which ruins the tea.

It's a stale flat roasted green tea with little flavor.,-1,Identified negative words suggesting dissatisfaction or complaint.

What I find is that they use a lot of licorice root in their blends (true with the blends in this set as well) which I find to be cloying. Licorice root can have health benefits so I don't object to the ingredient itself, but I personally am not a fan of the flavor.The teas in this set are not the teas from the current description. The blends are Turmeric Glow, Elderberry & Echinacea, Triple Ginger, Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey, and Blackcurrant Beauty. My favorites were ""Elderberry & Echinacea"" and ""Blackcurrant Beauty"". Although the bags say you can steep these up to 15 minutes, I prefer a shorter steeping time. For me the flavor becomes too much if I do a longer steep.The tea bags were scattered across the different sections instead of being one type to a section of the box. I felt like this was a bit sloppy for a product that is marketed as a gift. The box it came in was nice enough.Overall these are interested blends of tea but they fall short of the mark for me due to the licorice root in every blend + the presentation issues.",1,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

The amount of flavors, and their varying taste profiles, really makes this box a collection of hits or misses. On the other hand, such a large variety will allow you to quickly zero in on likes or dislikes and then you can specifically order the flavors that tickle your fancy.Matcha, Three Ginger, and Ginger and Manuka Honey are the clear favorites.  Flavorful with no odd aftertastes, a touch of stevia brings them to life. 5/5If you love black licorice and/or peppermint (which I do), it is very flavorful 4.5/5Then things start to get a little murky and the rest are strong 3's except the tumeric and echinacia  which are 1/5s and tasted very bad.Rose petal is like drinking the smell of rose flowers. At first I didn't like it, but over the years I've found it makes a great mixing tea with other flavors especially strong black teas.Overall, the collection itself is a 3/5, but remember the strength of this collection is you get to sample *9* different blends and decide what works for you.",2,Identified positive words suggesting satisfaction or recommendation.

I ordered this set of Pukka teas to be given as one of my mother's Christmas gifts. Upon receiving and opening this box, I was instantly greeted with an aromatic herbal fragrance that was very pleasant to my senses. The bags of tea were kind of scattered out of their slots, but otherwise looked fine. Before giving this as a gift, I will have to maybe place a sheet of bubble wrap over the teas to keep them from shuffling around before she opens the box. There was a nice assortment of tea flavors, but I was expecting at least 9 different flavors for her. We instead got 5 flavors, none of which were listed in this ad, so that was a little off-putting, although of the 5 flavor teas we did get, most I know she likes and enjoys drinking anyways. It just would've been nice to get her some new flavors to try.The box itself is very pretty, nicely decorated with flowers and gold foil.

The screw does not work to keep the monitor from floating back up. The screw is very hard to turn. I did manage to adjust the tension on the tilt - that worked. But I wanted the monitor as low as possible on the pole - in fact right to the bottom - but that does not work with the tension adjustment being inadequate. Also since I wanted the monitor's bottom edge right on the bottom almost flush with the desk, this was not possible to achieve as the minimum height was still the same height as my existing monitor stand.If you want a stand that allows the monitor to sit flush with the desk for us bi-focal wearing people., do not buy adjustable arms that rely on spring tension of any kind. They are usually too tight when purchased and hard if not impossible to adjust. Buy a pole stand that relies on screws and allen wrenches to hold the monitor in position. At least I hope so as that's the next type I will be buying after wasting $80 on this piece of crap.",-1

As far as height adjustment, I could find no way to lock it in place. As soon as I touch the monitor, it falls down to the bottom of the stand. After fiddling with it for a while, I removed this stand and went back to the one that came with the monitor, which has no height adjustment, tilt or pivot.

Rodrigues,2013年6月11日 在德国审核,"Diese Halterung sollte meinen Samsung SyncMaster 2433BW mehr Spielraum bei der Verticalen Neigung und eine Pivotfunktion bescheeren.Positiv:Drehfuß - Der Kreisförmige Fuß enthält einen dedizierten Ring für die Gummifüße. Der Ring ist drehbar gelagert und ermöglicht so eine sehr einfache Drehung des Bildschirms nach links oder rechts.Höhenverstellung - Die Höhenverstellung funktioniert gut und kann mit einer Schraube an das Gewicht des Monitors angepasst werden.Negativ:Neigung - Es geht kaum nach unten und nur wenig nach hinten. Somit keine Besserung gegenüber dem Originalfuß des Monitors.Pivotfunktion - Obwohl der Ständer für 24-Zoll-Monitore ausgelegt ist, war meiner wohl zu groß. Nach geschätzten 30 Grad ist schluss, denn der Monitor stößt auf den Drehfuß.Höhenverstellung - Wenn der Bildschirm vertikal verschoben wird, gibt eine Feder im Inneren des Ständers Geräusche von sich. Das wirkt nicht gerade solide.Schrauben - Die Schrauben für die VESA-Bohrungen sind zu lang. Dadurch konnte ich nur 2 der 4 festmachen, ohne zu tief in den Monitor einzudringen und somit elektronische Bauteile zu beschädigen.Die Neigungs- und Pivotfunktionen waren die entscheidenen Kaufgründe. Da beide als unzureichend erwiesen haben, ist das Produkt für mich unbrauchbar, weil es mir keine Vorteile gegenüber dem Originalfuß des Bildschirms verschafft (Höhe ist fix und das Gummi haftet nicht zu stark, sodass er gut gedreht werden kann).",-1

However, this won't work for heavier displays, because they make the whole thing top heavy. With a touchscreen display mounted, the stand would wobble from an occasional ""spirited"" touch.2) The base is made round to accomodate a plastic ring that allows the stand to be rotated (if slightly off axis). This design choice again makes the stand less balanced horizontally and in my opinion also gets in the way of a keyboard, especially if you have long arms and like to stretch them out while typing occasionally.",0

用に購入しました。今回装着したBenQ付属のスタンドはかなり長く、画面を見るのに見上げるような形になってしまうことが不満でした。別のディスプレイはモニタアームを使っていますが、アームはアームで可動範囲が限られる点や、アームそのものが邪魔になるので、今回スタンドタイプを購入しています。物自体はかなり頑丈で、32インチのモニタも使用可能なだけあり、安心して縦置きできます。またモニタアームのようにバネでモニタを持ち上げる構造で、思い通りの高さで固定できます。しかし2点気になるため、「まあこんなものか」という評価に至っています。1：横置きだと画面下が空く私もそうですが、特にドライアイ気味の方は画面を見下ろすような形で見たほうが、目が潤いやすく良いそうです。実際モニタアームを使っているモニタは、画面が机にくっつくところまで下げて使っているとかなり楽です。この製品の場合、BenQ付属のスタンドよりはマシですが、横置きすると一番下まで下げても4～5cm程隙間ができてしまいます。よくあるモニタの付属のスタンドで満足している方には大して気にならないかもしれませんが、モニタアームを普段使っていた身からすると、もう少し下まで下がってほしかったです。また24インチでこの状態ですので、さらに小さいモニタの場合は付属のスタンドのほうが低くなるかもしれません。2：スタンド底部の回転が邪魔モニタアームに縛られない形で使いたかったため、一週間に数回モニタの位置を換えています。他のレビューの中でも邪魔だと書かれていたスタンドの回転機能は、位置替えのときにも邪魔をしてきます。また回転機能は一回転分で止まってしまいます。たまに突っかかって面倒です。これは想定内でもあったので仕方ないと諦めていますが、やはり残念です。シームレスで高さ調整ができる＋モニタの縦横を簡単に換えられるスタンドはこの製品以外無いので、満足はしているものの、値段的には安めのモニタアームと同等の値段であることを踏まえると、これで本当に良かったのかと思います。シームレスで高さが調整できない＋24インチ以上だと垂直に縦置きできない点が気にならなければ、

I replaced both the OEM stands that came with my two LCD monitors.One was an HP w2007, a very good 20"" widescreen that I use for my main monitor.  The second one was for an Acer X163W 17"" widescreen that is my secondary monitor.Either stand easily raises the monitors to the correct viewing height, no need for books or other spacers (as was required with the OEM stands).I had intended in keeping the HP as normal landscape mode, and the Acer as portrait mode all the time-- but when I got these stands, I discovered just how easy it is to rotate the monitors 90 degrees back and forth.Thus, while I do primarily keep the Acer at portrait mode, I find I routinely rotate the HP between portrait and landscape modes.  With Windows XP, it's a simple matter to use Ctrl-Alt-Arrow to change the monitor's rotation.  Ctrl-Alt-Right Arrow rotates the screen into portrait, and Ctrl-Alt-Up Arrow rotates it back to ""normal"" mode.I find surfing the web in portrait (long dimension is up-and-down) mode much more satisfying than previously-- so much more page content is visible that way.Highly recommended.I did not give 5 stars, because the instructions were poorly printed and confusing.  That being said, the stands were a snap to install-- I used the thumbscrews for both monitors.  Adjusting the tension of the height spring for the Acer was a bit finicky (the Acer is very light), but I eventually got it to work (many turns of the screwdriver later).Now either monitor raises and lowers with a touch of the finger, and rotates from portrait to landscape with ease.The worst part was figuring out how to remove the OEM stands.... (why do manufacturers hide screws under rubber covers that are impossible to remove without damage?  HP was worse than the much-cheaper Acer...)",1

There were more screws than I knew what to do with, but I guess more is better than not enough.One minor flaw I saw was that I wasn't able to tighten all four screws because one of the bottom two screws is inaccessible because the body was in the way.  One of the two can be accessed by tilting the monitor 90 degrees.  But that last one you may need some kind of L-shaped tool to get to.  Fortunately the three other ones can be tightened well enough to support the majority of the weight.  That last one can be left a bit loose until a more appropriate tool is found to tighten it.Otherwise, the stand works fine as advertised.

I have three different monitors and the one on the NeoFlex stand wobbles the most when I bump the desk, but that's understandable considering it's a third-party mount.",0

It can be done, but not with a normal, straight, Phillips head screwdriver. Frankly, I don't know if this would be possible since it would mean narrowing the stand width, which may have to be at least a certain width to accomodate internal parts and/or monitor weight requirements.Secondly, the tension adjustment needs an additonal way to lock and secure the monitor at any height less than the very top so that it can't creep up or down due to too great/little spring tension adjustment. Having the tension adjustment access in some place other than the bottom of the stand would have been nice, too.Otherwise, this is about as good as it gets for an aftermarket stand that raises the monitor to a level that could lessen neck/eye strain. One nice feature I haven't seen mentioned is the ability of the circular stand to swivel the monitor like a lazy susan.",1

I am using it with a 17-inch View Sonic monitor that had been previously wall-mounted. It fits any standard VESA mount with the provided screws and washers, and it has a small footprint, so it doesn't take up too much room on your desk.The stand adjusts vertically and tilts up and down. In addition, you can swivel the monitor either portrait or landscape. You can adjust the tension on all of the vertical adjustment with a provided hex wrench. Finally, the main neck has a hole at the bottom to feed your cabling through. For my purpose, the folks at Neoflex thought of everything. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a standard LCD stand to avoid buying a new monitor.",2

The limiting means you may not be able to precisely level the display and your connected cables may not make for easy rotation in the only direction that is possible.  There is a fix, actually a defeat, involving the small ""tab"" that protrudes through the 90 degree curved slot on the mounting bracket.  Don't try prying in back in--you may damage the riveted assembly.  If you have a very small diameter portable grinder you could grind the tab down so it doesn't protrude through the limiting slot.  But I successfully used a nail set tool with a heavy hammer to pound the tab back through the slot.  It wasn't easy.  The steel is quite hard and it took several really hard hits.  I suspect the designer thought limiting the rotation would prevent tangled cables but I think most people are smart enough to do the right thing.  I've down-rated the unit one star because there may be a lot of inventory of the limiting units and I don't know which is the newest version.I bought this for my 18.5"" Sceptre LCD TV because the rigid stand that came with it does not allow tilt and height adjustments that are crucial to see its excellent picture.  Many LCD TVs or monitors have a narrow angle of view, both vertical and horizontal.  Only a stand like this gives you instant adjustability.  It's not an inexpensive addition to a low cost display but the quality and versatility are worth it.",1

Ideally, it would allow vertical and tilting movement.This solidly-made device does this and more - it also includes screen rotation.  It's very sturdily constructed and once attached by the 4 Vesa points on the back of the monitor, required no adjustments of screws or springs.  The vertical motion is spring counter-balanced and as supplied is suited to monitors in the middle of the specified weight range (mine is 5Kg); you just push it up or down.  This addresses the question of at least one one other reviewer who found it difficult to adjust: assemble it, set it up and as likely as not you won't need to adjust for monitor weight.I do find however, that it is best suited to workstation type use - for example in a warehouse or hotel reception (where I recently saw a number in use) - that is where the operator is normally standing.  This accounts in part for the lack of downward tilt - one of the things I wanted, since of necessity the monitor is mounted on a shelf above a desk.  The other reason I guess why downward tilt is lacking is to avoid instability in which the whole thing could topple forwards.  This type of tilt is probably only available with adjustable wall-mounted brackets, something I could not use in this particular instance.So all-in-all pretty satisfactory, if the downward tilt had been better, it would have had five stars.",1

As for the monitor height there is a screw which you turn a thousand times and you expect the height of the pad to change. Wrong!. I spend an half-an-hour turning the screw nothing would happen. After about an hour I realized that the screw just tenses or relaxes a spring inside. You will not be able to know  if the spring has the correct tension unless you assemble the monitor to the unit and let its weight to tension the spring, so it will stop and the equilibrium height, which may not be your favorite height. Readjusting the screw with the monitor already assembled is awkward, you will need some free space to do that, but doableAs for the tilt screw (the top one) it was so fastened that I could not, in both units, to un-fasten them, I even somewhat damaged the screw and the screw-drives. Will try to undo the nut below.  Turned out the weight of the monitors did the right tilt for me, anyhow, but why are the tilt screw so fastened. Both units?",1

Lots of issues.  The worst one is one that I might have figured out from the pictures, although they do not show it in an L-Shaped desk configuration with a typing table that adjoins a primary desk.  That's what I have.  The keyboard protrudes 14 inches from the typing desk, which makes it impossible to sit in the center knee space for the primary desk.My installation was being done by our IT professional and he was also unable to set a vertical adjustment that fixed it for sitting or standing in a way that it would stay in place. We spent a lot on the installation before concluding that it will not work. I have returned my order.  Sadly, the product needs more design work.",-2

This is a bad position because you have to always turn your head to face either the left or the right screen at time. Imagine how much neck pain you develop working in this condition for several hours a day over time. This actually affects your productivity because of how uncomfortable and unbearable it becomes after a while.Conclusion:Workfit Dual monitor stand sounds like such a wonderful idea and I actually fell for it. Considering how expensive it is, it is definitely one of my most regretted purchases after just a few months. I tried to keep using it periodically but finally gave up and gone back to monitors sitting on my desk with a very good chair, and that works way much better.",-1

However, I recently noticed that it was unable to keep the two 22 inch monitors fully raised.  It would sag down about 1-2 inches.  I tried to increase the resistance by turning the bolt on top of the lift mechanism clockwise in the plus (+) direction about one complete turn.  When I went to raise the monitors up to the top of the stands range, there was a large bang noise and the monitors were stuck in the up position.  Ergotron told me the warranty had expired about 5 years ago.  They said ""the lift mechanism inside the lift column broke and this is a non-repairable or replaceable part"".

They are easy to assemble, but the instructions are not the best for assembly.There are thirteen screws which are easy to assemble. You will need a socket set to adjust the tension. I didn't know this when I started and it was a pain in the rear to attempt to adjust the tension with a pliers. In order to adjust the tension, you could be doing 150 rotations (360 degrees) by hand.  Have a socket set or a drill gun with a socket attachment ready to go.When it comes to space, this device takes over the ENTIRE desk. No kidding. There are ways to adjust the keyboard placement, but it's a beast. I ended up putting the company phones on the surface under the monitor so that these people could use what was left of their desks.You will need longer power cords for your Monitor. The distance added to the top of the Ergotron is significant and it would behoove you to have a longer chord ready to go for the monitor alone. Also, you may want to have your tower on top of your desk to reduce tension between your mouse and keyboard.The tension is a big issues. Especially with the monitor. We reduced the tension all the way and the spring still kept the monitor tilted center up. It was a pain in the rear.Honestly, I don't get the whole ""stand at your desk"" malarkey. If you have back issues, try standing up for a couple minutes every hour and stretching your back. You could also reduce the need to sit at your desk by going mobile with a tablet. I stand all day and use a Surface Pro. It does everything my old desk top does. If you want to get this, it's workable, but be ready for all the installation issues I mentioned in this post.

It is VERY easy to lift up and bring down.  However, it takes up more space than the version that fits on top of the desk - this takes up the space between my desk and the wall behind me, and the ""extra"" space on the desk is ugly with lots of cords. .  There is no place to rest my hands/elbows and it's awkward (I am feeling a lot of pain in my wrists).  So it could be great if it fits with your chair and your space, but it was not a good fit for my space.  I am getting a new riser desk - flexispot - which another person in my office has and loves.

I purchased this product based on positive reviews and decent price point. It's relatively easy to put together, but the first thing I noticed is that the keyboard tray is incredibly flemsy - you can't type without a serious wobble and a lot of noise. Secondly, it's not strong enough for two 22 inch monitors as advertised. The monitors fit with the hinged bow (which I also purchased), but the workstation will not stay up - it immediately falls at least 12 inches after letting go - and then ever more when you begin typing. At 6 feet tall I have to bend my neck down to look at the monitors which defeats the purpose. The monitors are well within the manufacturer's weight restrictions.The manual does give instructions on how to strengthen the lift, but there are several issues with this ""strengthening"" function. First, the screw you are required to turn in order to strengthen the lift is located at the very base of the product just below the tray - meaning you either have to disasemble half of the thing or very awkwardly twist yourself to reach it. Second, the base of the allen wrench they give you to turn said screw is too big to make a rotation - you only get a quarter-turn before the wrench hits the base. This wouldn't be a huge deal, but the manual says it may require 115 complete turns to strengthen the lift! You're awkwardly turning this screw upside-down banging into the product at every quarter-turn scratching it up in the process. I am about 75 turns into this excercise and have seen no improvement.On the positive side, the workstation is sleek and looks great. Unfortunately it's just not effective. Please consider these points before purchasing.",-1

When in a cubicle, I simple raised the desk portion. Now at a true desk, I have been using a Veridesk Pro. At 6'2"", that unit required me to place blocks underneath to raise the desk surface to an ergonomic level (elbows at 90degrees.). I purchased this desk mount WorkFit-S model, as well as the tall user kit to raise the monitors. My hope was to reclaim some of my desk and improve the aesthetics. I wish I had looked at Ergotron's website more closely; even their own pictures show this unit to be terrible at ergonomics. There is this one picture where the gentleman pictured has his arms bent at an estimated 40degrees to reach the keyboard. My research (and pain) has that a terrible working position!Pros:Easy to setupEasy to adjust heightSmall footprintGreat height on the monitors (especially with the tall user kit)Allows for terrific seated position posture.Cons:Monitors are fixed. My previous setup used the other mentioned model along with a clamped monitor stand which allowed easy monitor sharing.Desk surface is smallKeyboard mouse surface is much too low for an ergonomically correct standing posture.Overall, I like the way this looks and operates. My coworkers are exclaiming how they've never seen me sit before. I have to explain that I cannot stand with this new setup without hurting my wrists. I am looking at ways to modify it. In my research at the Ergotron's website, I was shocked to see their advertising photos not to be ergonomically correct. I am trying to decide between raising the keyboard up 3-4 inches, or enlarging the desk surface.I attempted to register on the Ergotron website to place my comments in their forum. It's been hours and I'm still waiting for my activation email! My hope is to have a conversation with them about my experience. Others in this community seem to have mentioned the keyboard height as an issue. I think their solution was to sit down. This is not what I would like to do. Sitting down is strange to me after so many standing years.",-1

I went from two small monitors to one large one by getting the single monitor attachment. My biggest problem with it is that you can’t attach a webcam to your monitor because it will shake while you type. When it broke, I was pulling it upwards like I always do and it just launched upwards and made a large crashing sound like it’s internal track system snapped. I attempted to open it up, since it’s so desperately out of warranty, but the screws are very fragile and stripped immediately. I am getting special drill bits to try again, but fear from what I’ve researched that it’s now permanently a standing-only desk, so is no longer practical for my uses.  I always found the tiny desk area to be a bit inadequate, so will be upgrading to a different design that addresses that issue, likely at the expense of the quickness that this design lets you move from sitting to standing. It also doesn’t let you articulate the monitor, which other models allow, so it was not really that ergonomic when sitting down. Nonetheless, I was with it for almost a decade, so will miss it. I will likely forget it’s not there and grab for the now phantom pull handle when I stand up until I register the loss.",-1

I have back and neck issues.  Being able to stand or sit is absolutely awesome.  You can get the strain of you back for awhile.  I probably stand 6hrs and sit 2 hours at work.  The device itself is well made but it is unstable.  The extra work surface is entirely to flimsy to write or type on.  Since the work surface hangs from above there is no real support. You have to be ginger when using it.  No heavy leaning.  It is also to small so I added a shelving board to it by screwing it right to the existing surface. The upper work surface is stable because it has more contact with the suspension frame but is to high to use for typing.  The monitors need to be at a point where you look straight across and not down which makes the keyboard to high. You arms need to be at 90 deg when typing .  This device is excellent compared to others out there for price but needs to be more stable.  The base needs to be bigger and the work surface supports need to be stabilized better and this thing would be 5 stars easily.  I feel that for the price you are paying this is not to much to ask.  If you just want the choice of sitting or standing , then this device gets the job done. I am 6ft tall and the height on this device is maxed out when i am standing.",0

I find that I stand for about 70-80% of the day and sit the rest. Sit-stand desks are incredible, and if you're like me, you'll never wish to work at a conventional desk again. That said, there is one critical flaw with the Ergotron WorkFit series, you no longer have access to your normal desk. In order to access anything on your desk, you have to reach around the Ergotron. You  also need to be careful of what stuff you put on your desk under the monitors because when you lower the desk, your monitors may hit objects you placed under them. This desk accessory consumes your desk and you lose most of the value of the existing desk you would put this on.Overall, I like the Ergotron WorkFit Worksufrace. It is easy to use. My next sit-stand desk will raise the entire table surface rather than being a desk accessory.P.S. If you get any kind of standing desk, be sure to get a mat to stand on.",1

This is great for BOTH sitting and standing and improves ergonomics for both.  It is solid and easy to adjust.  Having the workspace attached is helpful.  For me, the benefits of being able to alternate between sitting and standing include decreased stiffness, increased energy, and easier collaborative conversations while looking at the screen.  It also means that when I do sit, I can do so more ergonomically because I can adjust the keyboard and monitor heights independently.  This is actually a pretty big deal for me because desks are almost always too high and when I'm forced to put my keyboard directly on the desk, my shoulders and neck pay the price in a very big way.  So, not only does this allow me to stand when I like, it also acts as an adjustable keyboard tray when I stand.  If you aren't accustomed to standing at work, I recommend also getting a resilience mat that you can set aside (to allow chair roll) when sitting.",2

And the shelf really is a great touch, since I can keep small items in reach at all times and have a place handy for signing papers and setting reference materials.Construction went fine--though there was some difficulty with adjusting the tension to the right level, and I have had no real problems with its use.I'd absolutely recommend it to people who can't afford a full-priced adjustable desk.",1

My old sit/stand desk system just sat on top of my normal desk.

This system clamps to the desk and allows the keyboard to be a couple inches lower than the surface it's mounted on.  Raising & lowering is easy as well.",1

There are only a couple of improvements that could be made. First, the tray that the keyboard sits on is not as deep as it could be. With the keyboard on it, there is little room for a wrist pad. My wrists hang off the edge and I have carpal tunnel so it is a little harsh on my wrists. The other improvement could be made to the stability of the stand. It is not unreasonably unstable, but shakes some when typing on the keyboard. Not a deal breaker though.",1

I just learned this the hard way and am incredibly fortunate my 3-year old is not more seriously injured. He was ""working"" (as mom and dad always do) while I was in another room, and when I heard the crash I came in to find that the entire desk with workstation -- about 100 lbs total -- had tipped over, knocked him out of the chair and pinned him to the ground. Miraculously, he only had a bruise on his arm where the keyboard tray landed on it, but it obviously could have been a lot worse and at the very least created a horrifying image that I don't wish any parent to have to live with as I have these past days. So...***** PLEASE SECURE YOUR DESK OR THE WORKSTATION TO THE WALL!! *******Even if your desk is sturdy or heavy, this workstation is top-heavy and the keyboard tray extending out creates leverage, meaning less weight is needed to topple it. You can see how I secured mine in the photo.Otherwise, it's a great workstation. The jiggles are a little annoying, but I think it's as solid as it could be.",1

I already had a standup desk, but I liked the Ergotron's easily adjustable feature, where both the keyboard and the screen(s) move in tandem. Installation was very easy; I only needed a philips screwdriver. All other needed tools are provided.Pros: The unit is of very solid construction. And, it is extremely easy to move up and down to adjust for standing and sitting. Plus, I like the neatness of it. The kit comes with a cable wrap material that neatly bundles all of the various chords into a tight harness that descends behind the desk.Cons: I'm tall (6'2""). The tallest setting of the Ergotron seems about 1"" shorter than what I want and need, causing my habitual shoulder-slumping to re-appear. I think I can resolve this, though, with a simple wood shim placed and clamped under the stand.Next con: The default keyboard table is both small and flimsy. I use the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard with 10-key and it barely fits. It actually extends about 3"" into the area of the even-more-flimsy retractable mouse shelf. Thankfully, because I use a trackball mouse, I don't need to move the mouse around. Also, the small keyboard table doesn't leave room for the after-market articulating arm support I use distribution weight from my soulders. To solve all this, I've purchased the optional larger and deeper keyboard tray, which should work fine.Last, the monitors only slide laterally. There is no ability to swivel or adjustability to them, for instance, to show your screen to someone standing in your office to one side.The cons are small issues, in my opinion, when I consider the overall value and utility of the unit - and they are all easily resolved with simple solutions.Overall, I am very happy with this setup.",1

Crosby,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018","I have one of these.  I like it.  I stand up probably 45 minutes of every hour on average.  The platform under the dual monitors was rickety on mine and I had to devise shims to tighten it up.  It's tight as a drum with the shims I put in there. The guy at work next to me got one to, but his didn't need any shims.  I got mine well before him, so maybe this was a problem that Ergotron has fixed. I wish that it would elevate another couple inches, but it's not a deal breaker.  If you're over about 6'2"" you might have to put wood between it and your desk though to get it up to where you need it.",1

It is worth every penny ... and in fact was less expensive and better designed than the original station I had seen online last year. Having the shelf for papers, drinks, cell phones or anything you can think of above the keyboard / mouse tray is brilliant! The clamp in the bottom to affix it to my work desk is also very smart as the whole station doesn't move around on me. I love being able to adjust the monitor height independently from the height of the station itself, as I find I want it lower when I'm sitting and higher when I'm standing.This is very easy to use; the convenient handle grip on the front of the upper shelf makes it easy to raise and lower ... and I love that now even sitting at my desk is more ergonomic as I can have the keyboard right at the level I want it, not at whatever level the desk happens to be.And as I work in a call center environment doing transport repair stuff, we are constantly being moved around to different desks (personally I think the only reason they keep reassigning teams to different areas of the floor is to make sure the desks get a good cleaning every 3-6 months! lol), so being able to just up and take this with me to another desk is very efficient.  Many companies will install an 'ergonomic' adjustable shelf for your keyboard (with a doctors' note), but they have to be drilled in to the desk, so when moving you have to wait for the installation guy to remove it from your old desk and re-install it at your new. Not very efficient time-wise.There are no 'locks' or 'cranks' to work on this station. It really is as easy as push/pull to the level you desire. I am literally the envy of everyone at my job, and many are already saving their pennies to get one of their own. My employer also offers benefits related to improving one's health; they reimbursed me for almost half as it falls under the exercise equipment category in our Wellness Program!Pros:easy to usethe ability to stand and stretch and wiggle and dance (if you feel like) while at your deskthe ability to back to sitting at any time without complicated adjustments to makehaving your notepad, pen, coffee and whatever else you like right in front of you-no lost desktop space!being able to easily move it from desk to deskeligible for company's wellness program, so I was reimbursed nearly half the cost!Cons:I don't really see any 'cons', but I will say that putting this together, while not difficult, will be MUCH easier, faster and done better if you do so AT the desk you intend to put it on. I made the mistake of trying to put it together at home before bringing it in and found that since I didn't have a surface I could clamp it to at home (it's not light, as it's what 40 lbs?), I didn't have the leverage needed to install the screws, so my keyboard tray is a little bit shifty ... and as I'd installed the shelf above the tray also while at home I found that once I got in to the office and had it clamped down I didn't have the room anymore to reach the screws on the keyboard tray to tighten them up.I am not bothered by the slight shiftiness of the tray, but I'm sure it would bug others ... so put it all together while it's clamped to something!",2

Lots of issues.  The worst one is one that I might have figured out from the pictures, although they do not show it in an L-Shaped desk configuration with a typing table that adjoins a primary desk.  That's what I have.  The keyboard protrudes 14 inches from the typing desk, which makes it impossible to sit in the center knee space for the primary desk.My installation was being done by our IT professional and he was also unable to set a vertical adjustment that fixed it for sitting or standing in a way that it would stay in place. We spent a lot on the installation before concluding that it will not work. I have returned my order.  Sadly, the product needs more design work.",-2

It broke down close to 5 years after ownership, just before the incredible 5 year warranty, BUT GUESS WHAT?  Ergotron is a fantastic company to do business with!  Here is what happened my lift mechanism broke I called Ergotron explained what had happened.  They immediately offered to ship me a new one, I was actually taken back how quickly they offered to replace it.  I asked if it was possible to fix this one as it seemed expensive for them to ship me a complete new one.  They informed me they designed a newer mechanism, wanted to get me the newer design (my old one was from prior 2014) and said they would honor the 5 year guarantee and ship me a completely brand new desk at no charge!  HELLO in a world of corporations using legal clauses to get out of paying anybody a penny I was beyond pleased with how nice, professional and so willing to delver to me a brand new desk Ergotron was to replace the broken one.  The reality is I have come to expect a fight with modern day corrupt corporations that will take your money easily but to get service it seems so hard or they fail to deliver what they promised full of ""legal"" excuses that border on criminal behavior, ever try to collect on any insurance, get a warranty on something?  Ergotron honored their 5 year warranty without even a second thought, in fact I was the one asking them if their was a cheaper way to fix this, what an incredible change of direction.  Ergotron restored my faith in how great a company can be and how a company actually can honor their warranty and do it with class to make the experience from the customers side beyond incredibly perfect and happy.  I am also glad I did my research before buying any sit stand desk and decided to move forward with a leader such as Ergotron who actually stood behind their product.  I have recommended Ergotron to my family and friends and would recommend you purchase one too.  How often does a company actually stand behind their products in this new world we live in.  I remember when I was a kid ""The customer is always right"" today it seems in the new giant corporations they could care less about the customer anymore.  Ergotron IMO honored 100% what they said and did it without any fuss and a smile.  It does not get any better than that.  I would highly recommend you purchase a product from Ergotron.  My new desk they shipped is just like my other and I STILL LOVE IT *** END OF UPDATE JUNE 13, 2018I LOVE MY ERGOTRON.  I stand almost ALL of the day only sitting occasionally.  I love how quick I can move everything up and down, much faster than the electric desk which are multiple times more expensive than Ergotron anyway.  I have my PolyCom phone on the middle stand so my phone moves up and down in sync with computer and screens.  It is great.  The reason I got this sit stand solution was because I was experiencing pain in the back of my legs from many years of sitting behind a computer. It was a serious warning shot something was wrong.  I bought the $1200 Herman Miller Chair it did not work when I called them they said I should not sit for more than 2 hours a day basically, HELLO most people work minimum 8 hours at a computer some 12+ hours,  I found that alarming.  I then thought why am I sitting instead of standing that lead me down the road to a lot research and this sit stand desk solution after a lot of research.  Money was not an object if need be I was considering some of the $5000 desks but in the end I like my existing desk and felt the Ergotron had a lot of time and experience in this area ahead of competitors, which ended up being correct.  I wanted to keep my desk so Ergotron was the best solution.  One thing that is not pointed out why I actually think Ergotron is better than a programed full desk that moves up and down by motor.  Here is why.  When I move this up and down it is not always the exact same levels meaning my body is slightly different even by 1/2 inch which means your body doesn't get the pains from being locked in the same position ie most people spend 8 hours with their arms exactly at the same relationship with keyboard mouse, with this you will naturally vary heights with the free flow movement which I found to be excellent too.  Variation prevents pain.  In addition not having a motor is one less thing to breakdown I thought in my buying process.  It has been a real life saver.  I stand 90% of the time.  One more interesting thing I learned standing allows for better mental focus you will be more alert conducting business which is yet another advantage over sitting.  I recommend getting anti fatigue mats.  I also got Ergotron® WorkFit Conversion Kit: Dual to LCD & Laptop  with this I have my 17"" HP laptop on the left and 19"" screen on right, this whole set up allows everything to be adjusted and customized.  I am 6 foot and has worked excellent.  These are high quality products.  After learning how sitting is killing us and shortening our lives I am very happy I invested in this solution.  The only thing you will have to get use to is a little shaking of screen when standing.  It all depends on how hard you type and how heavy of set up you have.  It doesn't bother me and doesn't happen when in sit position and only happens when typing.  Finally because I am not stuck sitting all day the pain in my legs is gone!  When I think back how we all sit at desks it is really insane to me to ever consider sitting like I use to.  The harm to your body is extreme as the studies show and my body was telling me, luckily I listened.  After you research what sitting risks are you will invest in a sit stand desk.  Even if you do not stand much just switching up sitting and standing every 15 to 30 minutes would be great.  I just found I love standing all day and being able to move around.",-2

This is great for BOTH sitting and standing and improves ergonomics for both.  It is solid and easy to adjust.  Having the workspace attached is helpful.  For me, the benefits of being able to alternate between sitting and standing include decreased stiffness, increased energy, and easier collaborative conversations while looking at the screen.  It also means that when I do sit, I can do so more ergonomically because I can adjust the keyboard and monitor heights independently.  This is actually a pretty big deal for me because desks are almost always too high and when I'm forced to put my keyboard directly on the desk, my shoulders and neck pay the price in a very big way.  So, not only does this allow me to stand when I like, it also acts as an adjustable keyboard tray when I stand.  If you aren't accustomed to standing at work, I recommend also getting a resilience mat that you can set aside (to allow chair roll) when sitting.",2

When in a cubicle, I simple raised the desk portion. Now at a true desk, I have been using a Veridesk Pro. At 6'2"", that unit required me to place blocks underneath to raise the desk surface to an ergonomic level (elbows at 90degrees.). I purchased this desk mount WorkFit-S model, as well as the tall user kit to raise the monitors. My hope was to reclaim some of my desk and improve the aesthetics. I wish I had looked at Ergotron's website more closely; even their own pictures show this unit to be terrible at ergonomics. There is this one picture where the gentleman pictured has his arms bent at an estimated 40degrees to reach the keyboard. My research (and pain) has that a terrible working position!Pros:Easy to setupEasy to adjust heightSmall footprintGreat height on the monitors (especially with the tall user kit)Allows for terrific seated position posture.Cons:Monitors are fixed. My previous setup used the other mentioned model along with a clamped monitor stand which allowed easy monitor sharing.Desk surface is smallKeyboard mouse surface is much too low for an ergonomically correct standing posture.Overall, I like the way this looks and operates. My coworkers are exclaiming how they've never seen me sit before. I have to explain that I cannot stand with this new setup without hurting my wrists. I am looking at ways to modify it. In my research at the Ergotron's website, I was shocked to see their advertising photos not to be ergonomically correct. I am trying to decide between raising the keyboard up 3-4 inches, or enlarging the desk surface.I attempted to register on the Ergotron website to place my comments in their forum. It's been hours and I'm still waiting for my activation email! My hope is to have a conversation with them about my experience. Others in this community seem to have mentioned the keyboard height as an issue. I think their solution was to sit down. This is not what I would like to do. Sitting down is strange to me after so many standing years.",-1

We are both IT professionals.  I did a bunch of research and it came down to the workfit-a or the workfit-s.  I know someone with a kangaroo, but I needed something for her that took very little effort to lift and the ergatrons fit the bill for that much better.  I thought the s looked sturdier, but she liked the a because it mounted on the back of the desk instead of on the front. I ended up getting both. We got both models with the extra work surface which makes a huge difference in usability and with the dual monitor setup.  I set up the a for her and the s for me.  Both have dual 21"" hp monitors. We use wireless keyboards and mice to simplify the cabling, although I had them set up wired initially and it was not a problem. It just took a little more work.We love both models for different reasons.  I like the s because it is simpler and I think the work surface, which is raised from the keyboard, is a better setup.  She likes the a because the arm gives much more flexibility in motion around the cube. They both work perfectly for what we wanted, something we could use to sit and stand with during the day that take almost no effort to lift and lower.I would recommend the s if you are tight on space and don't need the flexibility of the a. I would recommend the a if you have more room and want the flexibility of side to side motion. We don't have the bow hinge on either, so I can't say how they work, but we could see the benefit for sharing one monitor at an angle without having to have someone stand behind you.My wife sits and stands on and off during the day as her back requires as expected.  I thought I would alternate sitting and standing every other hour to try it out. I find I actually stand pretty much all day long at my station instead. I sit when I go to meetings and eat or after I work out.  I got very inexpensive stand mats (less than $15) and I use mine all of the time and it makes a difference on my feet.  My wife uses it less because it gets in the way when she uses her chair. I have a foot stool I use when I stand to keep one foot propped up on and off and I flip the mat over that when I sit, so it works out well for me.The bottom line is both of these workstations are excellent for our needs. With work surfaces and large keyboard trays, they will each run right at $500 apiece.  I find the benefit of being able to stand and sit well worth it. They are very sturdy, but they do take time to set up correctly. Setup is fairly straightforward with the instructions, but not trivial.  The only issue I had was the holes for the worksurface on the s didn't line up perfectly and took some time working that out. Adjusting the tension on either takes some time, more so on the a, but everything works when you get it right. I find that I keep the keyboard higher than I thought to avoid wrist fatigue, but at the right height, it is not an issue. Getting the cabling right so it is clean and tight also takes time, but it turns out well if you work through it.  If you are a hard typer, the monitors will bounce a little, but I adjusted easily and got used to it.  More tension could reduce that, but I don't find it an issue.The cool factor on both is way up there, particularly the a.  You will get attention.  I wrote this review because I found very little online comparing the two models. I hope you find this useful.",1

I'm feeling far more alert both during and after work. While standing, I'm much more mobile. I no longer need to ""get up and go get coffee."" I can just ""go get coffee."" That might not sound like much, but it's a big difference. While sitting, I'm far more comfortable, since the keyboard and screens are positioned at the correct heights for me.I'm standing about 75% of the day. I didn't need any time to ""ramp up"" to this level, but I'm also on the younger side. I do have a soft mat to stand on, since the office floors are concrete underneath thin carpeting.Set-up was easy, but I took my time to do things cleanly. Took about 90 minutes. They include some channeling for your cables, which was a nice touch. You may want to have a few spare zip-ties though. One tip: wait until the end to attach the writing surface, otherwise, the bracket that holds it down will get in the way of one of the tension adjustment screws. A second tip: have a ratcheting screwdriver with a couple of phillips bits, allen bits, and and sockets handy.The product is sturdy and well-built. A lot of the component parts are plastic, but I don't have any concerns about them breaking. It's made in China, which I'm not enthusiastic about, but there weren't any American alternatives that were similar in design. I considered purchasing one of the Kangaroo series workstations from Ergopro, but it didn't have the clamp to secure it to the desk, or the separate platforms for typing and writing.I've had to do some work at clients' offices these past two weeks as well, where I didn't have the Ergotron. It was miserable, haha. I'm probably going to end up buying another one of these for home, or better yet, convince my company to buy them for the office, so I can take this one back home for personal use. Several colleagues have already shown interest in getting them, so it's a possibility. Remember, if you buy it on your own, that's using post-tax dollars. If you can get your company to buy them, they can probably finagle a bulk discount, and they can use pre-tax dollars on it. It takes small bite out of their bottom line, but definitely pays for itself in productivity boosts, and when each unit is only a few hundred bucks, they can definitely find the budget.",1

This is a bad position because you have to always turn your head to face either the left or the right screen at time. Imagine how much neck pain you develop working in this condition for several hours a day over time. This actually affects your productivity because of how uncomfortable and unbearable it becomes after a while.Conclusion:Workfit Dual monitor stand sounds like such a wonderful idea and I actually fell for it. Considering how expensive it is, it is definitely one of my most regretted purchases after just a few months.

I went from two small monitors to one large one by getting the single monitor attachment. My biggest problem with it is that you can’t attach a webcam to your monitor because it will shake while you type. When it broke, I was pulling it upwards like I always do and it just launched upwards and made a large crashing sound like it’s internal track system snapped. I attempted to open it up, since it’s so desperately out of warranty, but the screws are very fragile and stripped immediately. I am getting special drill bits to try again, but fear from what I’ve researched that it’s now permanently a standing-only desk, so is no longer practical for my uses.  I always found the tiny desk area to be a bit inadequate, so will be upgrading to a different design that addresses that issue, likely at the expense of the quickness that this design lets you move from sitting to standing. It also doesn’t let you articulate the monitor, which other models allow, so it was not really that ergonomic when sitting down. Nonetheless, I was with it for almost a decade, so will miss it. I will likely forget it’s not there and grab for the now phantom pull handle when I stand up until I register the loss.",-1

The unit is solid and great quality with a smooth operation. One thing I worried about prior to receiving was if the worksurface could be written on without the unit lowering or too much shaking, it works great and is solid. You cannot lean on the desk or it will lower but writing/typing/mouse do not affect it. I also recommend the bow hing like other users, sharing the monitor during an office meeting is invaluable.I was also concerned about the monitors shaking during use. They do move slightly about a millimeter or 2, but it is not at all distracting as I thought it would be.I am 6 ft tall, with my dress shoes and a standing mat I am 6' 3 inches, and I use the tall users kit and it fits even better than before (no I am not an Ergotron salesman). I disagree with the ergo recommendations that say the top of the monitor should be two inches above eye level, I think that is true for sitting, but when standing you will want that sweet spot between where your head rolls forward and rolls back when relaxed. To attain this spot, you will want the center of the monitor at eye level or 2 inches above eye level. I am not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt but I have had standing desks for a year now and found this to be the most comfortable. To attain this height, I think even <6 ft tall users might want the tall users kit.The keyboard max height is the only restriction I have come across, at my height, my hands come down slightly from my elbows to the keyboard which is not recommended. I can angle the keyboard tray but it feels awkward. The keyboard has two preset angles and neither of them fit perfectly, it would have been helpful if the keyboard could raise just a little bit more or fully adjustable keyboard tray. The restriction is really based on the height of the desk you attach to, so if you can raise that desk, you could reach any height you want.Another useful piece of info I could not find anywhere else, you can use the tall users kit on the bow hinge. Also make sure you get a standing mat or your feet will hurt. I had a kitchen version the first time and it flattened out within a few months. I recommend getting one for industrial use.",1

I used to have a much more expensive electric desk, but I had to buy a new option at my new place of employment, and bought this on the recommendation of our ergo team at work.  I typically do not like keyboard trays, but this one is very solid/secure, and the good thing about it is that you can get the keyboard to the perfect height when sitting or standing, and the monitors will adjust separately up/down.  Very nice.The instructions for assembly are extremely clear, and there are YouTube videos you can use too.  I did have to use both adjustments (special, included tool for one, wrench for the other) to tighten up the tension so that the whole unit would stay solidly up or down, and so that the monitor adjustment (a separate one) would also.  Both adjustments are easy to overlook, but the instructions clearly tell you to adjust them, so it's really all about the user.

I like the extra worksurface but when standing I need a document holder to do my data entry.  This was interesting in the least because most document holders are solid and then block my monitors.  I am using a 3m legal size document holder with clear plastic and positionable legs.  I have the holder slanted way down so it is is below my monitors but slightly elevated from the flat worksurface.  Works great but I bet if Ergotron created a clip on legal size document holder with a moveable data entry guide it would be a perfect solution for monitor clearance.  Plus, my workstation is a semi-circle shaped where the computer should go.  I originally put the clamp off to the side which worked great but I didn't like having people walking quietly up to my back.  When clamped in the semi-circle area the keyboard ledge is a little long and will not go all the way down since it hits my desk.  I do not think I would have it that low due to my height anyways.  I tightened the top tension adjustment and can put alot of pressure on keyboard area and the desk does not move down.  Great!  I do not feel sluggish all day but up and ready to go.",1

Pounds,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2014","Several people at my office are using these, so I wanted to get one for home to try it out.  I had two 22"" monitors on risers before I installed the Ergotron and had to swap one out because it did not have a mounting bracket.  Installation took a couple of hours, but the instructions were clear. I did end up with a lot of extra screws, but better to have an excess than to be short a couple.  I have my laptop on the shelf (with my mobile phone charging) and a wireless keyboard and mouse on the keyboard tray. The surface is fine without a mousepad.In the first few weeks, I could stand only 1-2 hours at a time, but now I can do about 4 hours of work on my feet. I have a plastic carpet protector over a medium pile carpet in the office, so I did not go for a standing pad under my feet, but the folks at the office do have those.With the laptop on the shelf, cable management takes some work, so you may want to budget a few dollars for cables lengths that match the setup you want.Things to consider:Standing pad under your feetGet the right length cablesCan you mount your monitor?",1

Propping my monitors on a stack of books was a drag, and I just wouldn't do it.I've purchased many Ergotron solutions over the years, and I regret waiting this long to research a sitting standing option that was sleek and sturdy. The Work-Fit S is everything I wanted, beautifully engineered, moves from sitting to standing effortlessly, and attractive enough.

Lyon,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2016","I do enjoy this workfit system! The construction was excellent in dimensions (for books and such) and the installation was not difficult if you are savvy with instructions. I added the Conversion Kit for my laptop and that also works well. The adjusting of the monitor and laptop are done easily by sliding them left or right and a screw is in place to tighten them into place. The system can be adjusted to fit whatever weight you place on center shelf  very easily (with work or school related reason, not defiance). The station is worth the expense due to the ease of work, by transitioning from sitting to standing and vice versa. It beats having to push a button and your whole desk rises and then you forgot what you were doing. With that said, unless you need the contents of your desk at an arms reach, this is a great invention! If you are a student or a writer, I would only recommend purchasing the workfit with the shelf in the middle.",2

Would personally like to know the engineering that translates the tightening of a hex bolt to an increased counterweight.Like any exercise tool, the benefits of this device is dependent upon the habits of the user.  I have found that I got tired faster than expected from standing, and that it becomes harder to focus for certain tasks while standing, which may vary between users.  For instance, my plantar fasciitis prevents me from standing barefoot, but is mitigated by wearing shoes with a generic orthotic.

The ability to fine tune the height of the keyboard tray and monitors separately is nice.  The unit is stable with two 22"" monitors and I have no bouncing issues.As this unit clamps to the front of your desk, it's important to remember that this pushes you out from the end of the desk.  I'm not at the office now, but I'd say it adds a good 12"" from the edge of the desk.  At first I set mine up in the corner of my desk (it's an L shaped desk) and I was not able to lower the stand to sitting position as the keyboard tray would catch on the corner.  Once I moved it to a longer straight section, I was able to sit in a chair fine.Don't cheap out on purchasing a good anti fatigue mat.

I have been using one for many years, recently changed employment so I had to buy one for myself. It is easy to put together and extremely easy to use. I am a paralegal and without this stand, I would be stuck sitting for 8 hours every day with few breaks to walk around. My circulation is better with is a break to go from sitting to standing without disrupting the flow of work. I am also tall, at 5'9 a standard work desk is too short for me, this stand puts both the keyboard and monitors at the appropriate height so that I am not hunching over and can maintain my posture. It does take up a lot of workspace on your desk, but my overall health is worth the lost space.",2

Has follower wires and lock for 2 drawers.  Nice light gray color. I signed up for standard shipping but received this within 2 days-found it one morning outside my door. I feel this is overpriced (I paid $220)-I paid for the HON name. It is an average file cabinet except for the fact that it has follower wires (some brands have no wires or follower block) and the color of light gray is not often found. I researched file cabinets a great amount on Amazon before buying. A big issue is the follower block (which is better than follower wires). I learned that many file cabinets no longer come with followers to hold back file folders.,1

Has follower wires and lock for 2 drawers.  Nice light gray color. I signed up for standard shipping but received this within 2 days-found it one morning outside my door. I feel this is overpriced (I paid $220)-I paid for the HON name. It is an average file cabinet except for the fact that it has follower wires (some brands have no wires or follower block) and the color of light gray is not often found. I researched file cabinets a great amount on Amazon before buying. A big issue is the follower block (which is better than follower wires). I learned that many file cabinets no longer come with followers to hold back file folders.,1

Couldn't figure out why I was developing lower back problems till i realized this was happening. It is some type of cheap plastic horizontal bar embedded between 2 layers of the chair back and it slides down about 2"" with me sitting in the chair for 2-3 hours. I have to add something behind my back now to prevent the back issues it was causing. It wasn't great even when it was staying in place.# This is likely my fault that I missed something in reading the description on Amazon or the Steelcase site, but YOU CAN NOT ADJUST THE CHAIR BACK TO A POSITION COMFORTABLE FOR YOU! I've never had a chair without the feature to set the back to a position comfortable to me. You can lock it into a position that they decided is best (yeah for a tall man, as usual) or else the back moves forward and backward and you can only adjust resistance.# A selling point was that the seat slides forward or back to accommodate different thigh bone lengths. What they don't say is that moving this forward or back from the ""norm"" will have you sitting at a place on the chair seat that tilts your spine in the wrong direction. I think this would be equally uncomfortable for a tall person as it is for shorter.# The chair back is designed for a taller person (I am 4'11""). I bought this chair because ergonomic websites said it was a good choice for a short person--not true. if you are short the sides of the back curve forward where your shoulders and arms are making your shoulders and arms roll forward in inward...and you'll find yourself with horrendous posture and bad upper back pain# Very little cushioning in the seat. my sit bones start to hurt if i'm in the chair for very long# The chair arms are nice in that they move in many directions. but as others have noted, they don't stay in the position you want. you adjust yourself in the chair (as you would with any other office chair) and the arm slides out of the desired position.# Something I never thought I'd complain about, but the chair rolls WAY too easily. I have a chairmat since my desk is on carpet. All day the chair keeps rolling away from my desk just from the movement of my arms on the keyboard and mouseI hate to just throw away $600, but it is now costing me a lot more in chiropractic bills to fix all the issues it has caused, and I don't think for that much money I should have to be buying back pillows and lumbar cushions to make it not tortuous to sit in the chair.I had a $300 chair for 8 or 9 years and this was to replace it as the cushioning in the seat had finally broken down (it was tempurpaedic and lovely). this chair is a torture device and poorly made and more than twice the price. Lesson learned, never buy a chair based on online reviews claiming it is good.",-2

How did this pass inspection? - for a price point of $707 plus, it should feel like I am sitting on cloud nine. Instead, the seat is a menace to my body. My seat cushion is not leveled. Another reviewer pointed out this same issue. The left side of my seat is raised slightly higher than the right side. I felt it, then saw it after sitting in the chair on the second day. On day one of sitting in my chair, I thought my left thigh was slightly larger than my right one, no biggie - bwahahahahahahaha. All joking aside, this chair poses serious bodily harm to anyone sitting in it for an extended period of time. After a week of sitting in the chair, I felt like my left hip was separating form my lower left back and left leg. During week two, I placed a folded piece of fabric on the right side to try and balance it out, while I shop for another chair. For $707 plus, come on. This could have been avoided.I cannot wait to return this menace. You cannot sit in this chair as is for longer than a week without ending up with serious spine, back and hip issues. Shame on whomever passed this chair through inspection. I am too traumatised to exchange it for another one for fear it will be the same issue.Kudos to those of you who received a perfect chair. Mine ""coulda been a contender."" It coulda been five stars.",-2

W,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2021","bought the chair a week ago. liked it initially, but after a week my left lower back starts to feel funny and pain. then I realized that the left side felt higher, both the seat and the left arm rest (when adjust to highest and lowest position). I used a level and found indeed, seat is not level. First picture shows bubble of level on the left side of chair (when sitting on it your left side); second picture shows bubble of level still on the left side of chair after turning chair 180 degrees (so it's the chair's problem not the floor). third picture shows if i put my fingers under the level and jam up the right side of level, bubble returns to middle of level, so the left side is about a finger higher than the right side.When the arm rests are raised to the highest, the right arm rest is level with my desk, but the left side of arm rest is noticably higher, again, maybe higher by a finger.This obvious problem shouldn't have passed quality control before shipping.I've requested customer support on Steelcase's website and will update this review as it develops.update: on 8/31/2021Steelcase promptly replied me, and provided some instructions for me to try to fix this, but not successful. they offered me warranty, and also suggested that Amazon has 30-day free return policy. I've returned the product to Amazon. I'm changing from 1-star to 2-star due to prompt customer service. I hope this review will be helpful to Steelcase and other customers. If other customers experience the same issue, a recall may be needed.",-1

I'm an IT engineer, a gamer, a graphic designer, and I make/edit videos for fun, so I sit at the computer just about the entire day for work and for recreation. As you can imagine, I wanted to buy a nice chair that would support me and keep me comfortable throughout the day. This chair does neither. It's uncomfortable after about 10 minutes of sitting and I find myself squirming around all day trying to keep the aches and pains down.The arm rests move too easily and I only ever want them in one position. There is no tilt lock and the tilt mechanism doesn't tie in with the chair bottom, so it constantly feels like I'm sliding out of the chair. The padding in the seat was gone after about 6 months, so it now feels like I'm sitting on solid plastic. It's impossible to sit with good posture in this chair and stay that way while being able to lean and move as they would advertise it. The tilt resistance knob also wears out in less than a year. It's turned as tight as I can turn it, but I still don't have enough resistance, so now I find myself leaning backwards too easily.I had higher hopes for a $650 chair.",-1

I returned this chair to Amazon because I thought this was a defect and the next chair I got had the same exact issue. It is funny because I bought this chair because my old chair, which is 15 years old, started to makes these sounds and now this $700 chair is worse! I talked with Steelcase and they told me that this is indeed a defect and that I could get a new one, but that was a month ago and now they haven't been returning my follow-up emails. I would not recommend buying this chair.",-1

The chair seems well built and highly adjustable, but I find that it just plain HURTS!  The problem seems to be combination of seat shape and lack of padding, so the circulation to the back of my legs is cut off, resulting in pain in the back of my thighs for quite a while after I stand up.  It usually eases after several minutes of walking around, bending my knees and clenching my butt cheeks.I am regular build, 6 foot, and can sit in the hardest, crummiest chair at any fast food restaurant or school gymnasium with no trouble. There is just something about this Steelcase Amia that causes me a lot of pain. I wish I never laid eyes on the damn thing. I hate it. I hate how much I paid for it. It's terrible. I wish I could return it, but I bought it from a local retailer.",-1

It's very uncomfortable to sit in for longer than a few minutes as the seat cushion is very thin. The arm caps are a nuisance as they constantly move whenever you touch them. This chair is not worth more than fifty bucks. The only good thing about this chair is that it does not squeak like my older and more comfortable Steelcase chair.

It’s obviously used, see the stains in the picture, but all of the features work.Also, it didn’t even come in a box??? No instructions either??? But luckily it was easy to put together. The chair is a real godsend for my back and luckily I work on a nursery so the chair isn’t going to stay clean for very long so I can live with a few stains.If you’re looking for something in “like new” condition, don’t buy this chair!!!!",0

I got the fabric chair with fully adjustable hand rest. I received the chair with a small scratch on its back panel, the hand rests are very flimsy, they have a very cheap feeling, and the lumbar support is useless, doesn't help at all. However the seat comfort i.e., the padding is good. I decided to go with Amazon instead of Steelcase directly because Steelcase's customer service is awful, they never pick up your call.

I thought this chair was supposed to be great for small people.  I've only had it one day, but so far, even with the seat pushed all the way in, I have to sit forward on the seat (can't use the backrest) while typing on my laptop. It might be a little better if I had a separate keyboard that I could pull toward me further instead of a laptop. I think I will need a cushion between my back and the backrest if I want back support while typing.  It does feel comfy if I lean back in the chair, but then I am not totally upright and not in a great position for typing. Sigh.  Same with my desk chair at work (some other brand).  Nothing seems perfect for a smaller person.",0

Brining,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2013","I work from home and spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer. When I'm done with my work day I... end up spending even more time sitting in front of a computer. Up until this point I've used office chairs frequently found at brick-and-mortar office stores. You know the type: $50-100 for chairs made with plastic painted to look like metal, cheap leather seat covers and low-quality foam. They're okay, but I figure if I'm willing to spend several hundred dollars on a bike I might ride once or twice a week, shouldn't I spend at least that much money on a chair that I'm sitting in several hours a day, seven days a week?A friend of mine has a since-discontinued Steelcase chair that I liked a lot. I wanted a high quality but still fairly affordable chair and I decided to take a chance on the Amia because it was more affordable than other chairs in its class.Pros+ This is a really solid chair, very well built. The seat post doesn't wobble, the seating surface is firm and the frame made of metal and high quality plastics.+ It comes pre-assembled so you don't have to spend an hour figuring which bolts go where, trying to line up canvas holes with wood holes underneath or screwing on that one caster that just doesn't seem to want to screw in properly.+ It's very adjustable. You get the standard controls you find on most chairs: Hydraulic lift and a recline/no-recline toggle (and unlike some lower-end chairs I've owned, the toggle doesn't give the impression that it'll flip itself on or off out of the blue). There are several more adjustable items too, like the ability to slide the seating surface forward or back to match up with your body type. The seat-back torsion level is also quite nice, allowing you to customize just how much resistance you encounter when leaning back. The armrests can be raised and lowered and locked into place easily  .+ It's a sharp looking chair. It's not too big but not too small and it has a very clean, functional design.+ It's quite comfortable too, even though it's firm. Or firm even though it's comfortable (depending on your firmness-versus-comfort priority).Cons- The arm rests. They can slide forward and back, move in or out, even pivot at up to a 45 degree angle all in the name of adjustment (the Steelcase-provided video on the product page highlights just how adjustable they are). The problem is that with the exception of the height, there's no locking mechanism once you get the arm rests in the desired position. This results in arm rests that can slide out of position when leaned on or grabbed. They can easily be maneuvered back into place, but it's an annoyance.- It does creak a bit more than expected when reclining, but that may be the result of having the recline-torsion knob turned too tightly. I dialed it back a bit and that seemed to reduce (but not eliminate) the creaking.The arm rest movement and creaky noises are annoyances, but they shouldn't distract from the bigger picture that this is a comfortable and well built chair.",1

Paid for a Steelcase in the hope the seat and back will keep their shape for more than a few years.  Adjustments are nice including sliding the seat forward for a larger sitting surface.  The wheels are very good and roll more easily than my previous chairs.One thing I don't care for is a ""feature"" where the armrests can move side to side and front to back.  Cool idea by itself but i wish I could lock them in place.  They tend to move when you shift in the chair.",1

I'm sure that if bought new this chair will be as good as its reputation suggests.I bought a refurbished model described as ""Like New"" at a very good price from Officelogix.com. Shipping was very quick. Unfortunately, when the chair arrived, the seat height adjustment did not work. The lever would not make contact with the top of the piston. I tried adjusting the set screw without success. I tried removing and reinserting the gas piston, likewise w/o success. I tried contacting Officelogix directly. I got voicemail. A bit later I got an SMS in return offering to help via text. When I described my issue I got radio silence. So I've elected to return it. We will see how well that process goes.UPDATE: The seller contacted me and suggested various options to fix the chair. I was eventually able to get the chair to function properly. After a few hours working in it, however, the cylinder locked up and would neither adjust for height or swivel. A new cylinder is on the way from the seller and we will see how it goes.When it works, the chair is very comfortable.UPDATE 2: The seller sent me a replacement cylinder and that appears to have solved all problems. I've updated the review to 4 stars for the chair. It took me far too long, and far too much of my time to get the chair I actually wanted. On the plus side, I've had a pretty thorough course in office chair repair.",-1

Stidham,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2022","Researching an office chair is not fun.  Performing that research via online articles and other people posting their videos are not substitutes for you putting your own body into the chair and getting a real feel for it yourself.Having said that, I feel I did the best due diligence I could without being able to sit in this chair.  I was lucky enough to find it as an Amazon Warehouse deal, which made it very reasonably priced.  It arrived packaged well enough and required zero assembly, as I believe is the case with all Steelcase chairs.Overall, the chair is acceptable.  I am not a small man at 5' 11'' and (currently) weighing around 300 pounds.  This chair is very sturdy.  The back height is fine, but you won't be taking a nap in it.  There are many videos and articles out there if you look for them, and you can learn about the functionality and features accordingly.  I found nothing out of the ordinary and all features and functions work perfectly.While this chair is rated by Steelcase as a 24/7 use chair and is easily rated for more than my weight, I will agree with some of the reviews that state the actual seat cushion could be plusher.  After a few hours, I had to get up.  This is a good thing, as the chair aids in my not being chair bound as I either work from home or do other chair tasks.  This may be related to my current weight and might not be so bad for a person that is lighter than I am.All-in-all, for the Warehouse Deal pricing that I found, this chair works for me.  A more typical retail price and I may have been more strongly tempted to return it as I would prefer a chair that I could comfortably sit in for all day - even though I know I should get up to get the blood circulating.",0

The mechanisms work smoothly, are silent, and stay the way I put them without that pneumatic creep I have experienced in cheaper chairs.  It is easy to adjust and my back no longer aches.  I can tell it is well made and expect it to last for many years, just like the last time I spent $$$ on a quality chair.  I do wish the seat had a bit more of a cushion, but it is not a serious complaint as there are no hard spots like I have felt in other chairs.  And no assembly needed; just a really big cardboard box to cut up and recycle.A little about me:  I sit at my computer desk for hours at a time.

Very easy to rotate with very little effort.Seat pad is comfortable and is used all day with no comfort issues (8-12hr).Only con is when leaning back, after 2 months, the chair has started to squeak like an old antique chair.

So far, I am impressed.  The chair arrived fully-assembled.  All I needed to do was remove the standard packaging materials.  The video on the product page was useful for explaining each adjustment.  I chose this specifically for the range of adjustments it offers, and it did not disappoint.  Within just a couple of minutes I had it dialed in to where it feels comfortable and supportive, like it was made for me.My only ""complaint"" is that I received a black chair instead of blue.  The box is labeled ""blue"" so it looks like a packing issue with the manufacturer, not a warehouse or shipping error.  I checked the rest of the tags and otherwise I'm sure it's the correct item in a different color.  That's the only reason for lowering the rating by one star.  Honestly, I would have purchased black to begin with, but at that time blue was both less expensive and available sooner.  I couldn't be happier with the mistake.",1

I like most everything about it, including the height which is sufficiently low for me and the overall look. The only thing that made it lose points for me is the softness/comfort of the seat. It's not too hard or uncomfortable, but it does not offer much cushioning and doesn't feel particularly soft. Otherwise, good solid fully adjustable chair.",1

I have had the chair over a week and I can say it was a good buy. My shoulders and back are more relaxed then with other cheap mesh chairs I have purchased before. The quality is good and the delivery was on time. Dont be afraid to split the difference in the price and go with this mid-level chair.,-1

Finally I gave in and spent good money on a Steelcase for home, and I do not regret it one bit. I should have done that a long time ago. This chair is designed and built to be sat in for extended periods of time. Combine that with the fact that you'll easily spend this much money replacing cheaper chairs, and you'll soon see the value in owning a good chair like this.This chair has the carpet wheels, fully adjustable armrests, seating depth, and lumbar support. The carpet wheels seem to roll even easier than the rollerblade wheels I had on my previous chair. The cloth is durable and looks good too. The chair is big and strong enough to fit my 6'5"", 275 lb. frame. Fit and finish are pretty good also. It came fully assembled and ready to go.Get one. Your butt will thank you.",2

Chair arrived with back rest damage, something heavy landed on top of box and separated pad from back rest. Back rest had bend and dent but I was able to make a full repair, not sure if others could though. Chair works 100% like new except for a dent and couple bent areas in back rest that you do not feel when sitting on. I am 6’ and 240lbs and chair is great, would of liked an option to attach a head rest but I’ll be ok. It’s a great unassuming office chair that doesn’t get the looks of others so I am glad I didn’t pay the full price and to be honest, now that I have been using it for a couple of weeks, my mind has changed and I wouldn’t have minded paying full price now either. It’s a great work chair. Seat is very comfortable, back is comfortable, overall well built chair. I overly scrutinize and critique everything and the only complaint I have is that there’s a slight bend to back rest from previous damage. Those taller than 6’ should probably look at Steelcase Gesture or Leap V2 as those have taller backrest and or head rest options but those chairs are a lot more money.  I think this Amia chair has a more comfortable seat pad anyways and I can use this chair for 8 hours a day and have no pain or stiffness in my back or legs. I cannot say that about other chairs.

Working from home and using a lousy office chair wasn't working for me and I didn't feel like spending thousands of dollars on the high-end ones that are out there. This chair is a good mid-range compromise. It's not soft on the seat, but it gives just enough to be comfortable to use for extended periods of time. If you like a seat that you sink into with lots of cushiness then this is not the chair for you. The back-stop is also tension adjustable to make it easier or harder to lean back based on your comfort level, but you can't fix the back-stop at a given position once you find a position you like. This is not a problem for me because I just crank up the tension to make leaning back more difficult, but no so much that it isn't possible to do. I like the adjustable seat slide, which is something I've never had in an office chair. The armrests are height and width adjustable as well. Being able to adjust the width of the armrests is a nice feature.The only possible negative to this chair would be that the cloth fabric may stain easily if you spill something on it like coffee or tea. I've managed not to do this yet, but the day will probably come. Be prepared with something to clean your spill quickly or live with the result.Overall, I am very happy with this chair and I would recommend it.",1

We have different tiers of Steelcase chairs throughout the halls and conference rooms. At our desks we have Steelcase Leap chairs. I find the Amia to be identical in support and features. I bought two for the home office and am very satisfied. It features terrific support and fits many body sizes and sitting styles due to its adjustability. The seat area is very generous, and I can sit straight or with a leg up. The Amia is a chair that promotes good upright posture at a desk for an entire day. It's not for kicking back and watching a movie. I find the lumbar support on all expensive office chairs, Amia included, to be a bit aggressive, but it's because I tend to slouch in my chair. If you want something much softer, you can try la-z-boy or stressless office chairs which have a totally different ergonomic objective.In my opinion, the Amia is about as good as it gets for an office chair, but that's to my taste based on sitting on many different office chairs over the years. I would advise not to buy a chair motivated by reviews, but by sitting on them in showrooms or in an office. I bought these because I was familiar with them.The Steelcase Store on Amazon sells the Amia for ~20-30% less than Steelcase directly if you buy in all black. Make sure to check that you are purchasing from Steelcase and not another 3rd party in the Amazon marketplace.",2

I even bought one for my wife around the same time, and she is still using it. The Steelcase brand is terrific. They last. In fact, both of the Leap chairs still look, feel and function like new!With the ability to work-from-home, I needed a chair for my home office and once again took the opportunity to research chairs. After hours of investigation, I decided to give the Steelcase Amia chair a try. All the reviews said that the seat was a bit softer than the Leap. My opinion is that the Amia has a more comfortable seat with slightly thicker padding. Also, the shape of the back of the seat to the lower part of the back of the chair to the lumbar support really cradle my butt and lower back. I feel like the chair supports my sitting position while NOT putting pressure on my tailbone.The adjustable arms and most of the functionality of the Amia chair are the same as the Leap. The only difference is the recline adjustments. The Leap allows you to set 'stops' in different degrees of recline where the Amia only locks in the fully upright position. For me, if I'm in the chair I am tasking and not reclining. There is however a recline tension knob on the Amia that, when maxed out, offers plenty of resistance to the reclining function. Is the recline function as nice as the Leap? No. But for me it was a non-issue.The Amia chair is hundreds of dollars less than the Leap. It is built just as well, and I expect it to last just as long. It's a Steelcase.",1

Those racer styled chairs are very poor both in comfort and in support. My chair had pretty much bottomed out in about two years and the back had no support at all besides the little cushion they typically include.This was my first venture into an actual office chair that was reviewed as being a very solid chair. I did a ton of research prior to landing on the SteelCase Amia and I really do enjoy it and it has been a very solid upgrade. To be quite honest, I was expecting the seat cushion to be more comfortable but you really begin to see the value when you have been sitting in it for a couple hours. I typically only get to game on Saturdays but usually its for 8+ hours and it really excels and shows its value in that department. While the initial sit down wasnt exactly what I expected, the comfort that it has even after hours of continuous sitting really did surprise me. My previous chair also couldnt lean back at all so it really is nice you can lean back quite a bit if you are just relaxing watching youtube or something.Overall, definitely worth the money especially if you are sitting for long hours. Get away from those racing style chairs as they are really just not that comfortable and you will go through 2-3 of them in the time that this chair will last you.",1

I tried some of the office max Workpro chairs and Secret Lab chairs and they just did not cut it. I had used a Leap v2 before going remote and absolutely loved that chair but it is a little pricey. I am more of a fan of this Amia than the leap, its more comfortable to sit in for long periods of time! The only thing I wish this chair had is being able to lock the recline in specific positions, like the Leap.The chair's fabric is very comfortable, lumbar support is phenomenal, and the movable arms are fantastic to get the perfect seating position. You can slouch, lean, or move around in the chair and it is not uncomfortable in the slightest.Would highly recommend this chair if you don't want to break the bank but want a premium home office chair!",1

The seat cushion is probably the best part of the chair but absolutely everything (adjustments, ergonomics) else is excellent as well.  At work I sit in a $1600 Haworth Fern and this thing is more comfortable than that.  If you're reading reviews on this buy it even if it's a $1000.  Worth every penny.

It would compare very well to the Steelcase office chairs used at my workplace - the construction is perhaps less robust. I've waited to review it until I had a chance to use it routinely for a few months of 8-12 hour work days. The manufacturer's instructions for adjustment are easy to follow and, at least in my case, resulted in a good ergonomic setup. I think physical characteristics of the user may be a factor in whether the chair is ultimately a good fit for others; so I'll share mine for comparison: I'm about 5'10"", weigh 150 pounds; my legs are relatively long; and my torso is relatively short.

I did a lot of research on ergonomic chairs since I've had various ergonomic/overuse-related issues in the past, and ended up with this one. I can only compare this to the only other modern ergonomic chair I've had, the Allsteel Acuity (which I sit in 9 hours/day at work). I like the the arms of the Steelcase Amia are more adjustable horizontally than the Acuity, since I tend to keep my elbows right up next to my sides, and the Acuity's don't go in far enough for this to work comfortably for me. The seat does not slide out and stay level like the Acuity's when you lean back, it does tilt back slightly. Also, the back (unless I just haven't figured out how to adjust it), is either up, or all the way back - you do not have to apply any muscles to get it to lean back.

I had just ordered other office chairs that required 3 weeks lead time, but needed something quicker. In the meantime, several people who sat in the Amia Chair asked me to get them one. For me, it is just the right amount of cushion, and the back puts my spine in a neutral position. All of the available adjustments make it just right for each individual. I had ordered a high-end mesh-back chair for myself, but ended up with the Amia instead because this feels better on my back. If you like the really padded, cushy chairs, this may not be for you. But if you need support and a neutral back position to avoid back pain, this is a great chair.",2

Chairs were to high and seat depth to deep.  I am short. 5 foot.  I did research on chairs for short people.  Steelcase Amia was suggested because the seat depth can move forward and back.  Also height goes low.  Well, this chair solved my problem in one week.  Perfect for short people with back support.  Only thing I would like to see Changed is the ability to adjust arm rest width.

Ergonomics are excellent.  I'm 6'2"" and it works great.2. Solid as a rock.  I'm a big person and I can lean on it heavily and it doesn't move.  Yes you can make it rock a tiny bit, but it doesn't move a millimeter when I hammer away on my keyboard.3. Roomy.  I'm so glad I got the bigger TL.  Plenty of room on the keyboard stand for a standard keyboard and mouse.  The top platform has a 23"" monitor and my 15"" laptop with docking station.  There's still room for my calculator, iPhone, planner, etc.4. Good looking.  Yes, my desk looked better without this on top, but I was surprised by how professional it looks.  The fit and finish are excellent.  Several people have commented on that.5. It came with the nicest looking wire loom for the cables I've ever seen.  The self-adhesive cord holders that mount under the top surface just behind the keyboard stand (for the mouse and keyboard cables are slick.  I didn't need all the wire ties, they gave me or the rubber feet for the monitors, but there they were.6. I'm standing 3/4 of the time now.  I knew it would be helpful for my back &  health, but I underestimated how much more productive I would be standing than sitting.  When I want to sit, it's easy to lower.  Raising it back up again is a cinch.7. The straight up-down motion, as opposed to the ones that project forward when raised is a great feature.  I can't see any negative with it and if you have close quarters, it is invaluable.I could go on, but you get the idea.  I cannot encourage you enough to buy a cushioned surface to stand on.  However, don't blow your brains out with the specialty ones for sit/stand desks.  I bought an $18 one at Costco that was designed for kitchen use.Finally,  I don't write a lot of reviews, just for the products I love or hate.  If I haven't been clear enough, this is an awesome product.  This is much nicer than the Vari-Desks I have seen.  Don't skimp, buy the best.",2

It is very solidly built, steady as a rock, and beautifully engineered.  When typing there is no bouncing or wobbling of the platform, keyboard or monitors.  The adjustment from sitting to standing position is very easy and the mechanism is quite and very smooth and does not take a lot of strength to raise.  It takes just seconds raise or lower it.  The height adjustment is variable - the unit clicks into position to lock at the selected height when the spring-loaded handles on the left and right are released.  This means that you can easily raise it to whatever height you are comfortable with.  I am just over 70 inches tall and prefer it close to the maximum height.  At its lowest position it is not too obtrusive and I find that I do not have to adjust the monitor height at all when transitioning from sitting to standing and back again.The stand weighs about 70 lbs but setup is a breeze because it comes preassembled.  Just unpack it and place it on your desk, remove a few more packing materials, and you are good to go.  I originally ordered the Ergotron WorkFit Dual Monitor Kit (97-904) as well because I was concerned that with my two monitors (24"" diagonal screens) the stand would be unstable when raising and lowering it, but I ended up cancelling my order for the kit because the monitors sit very nicely on the stand and feel quite secure.  An added benefit of this arrangement is that I can move the monitors around to adjust their distance from my eyes and their relative angle, which I could not do if I mounted them to the stand using the kit.One thing I would note is that the dimensions on the Ergotron website imply that the unit is 23.25 inches deep but the keyboard tray projects an additional 4 inches so that total depth is about 27 inches.  This was not a problem for me because my desk is 30 inches deep.  Also I would say the color is charcoal grey not black, but that is fine too.  I am very happy with this stand and can recommend it without reservation.",2

I did some research and this brand is apparently the best. There is literally no set up except to put your stuff on it.I have two large monitors that fit perfectly on this stand. It is huge and heavy. Very very solid. It doesn’t jiggle with any movement. It’s a smooth loft and lower and not hard to do at all.

It fit pretty well with the back hanging off just a little bit but it’s still very sturdy.The set up was virtually nonexistent since it came ready to go. It definitely needs two people to lift onto the desk since it’s 50+ pounds. It’s super easy to lift into a standing position (which I do multiple times a day) and lower into a sitting position. I also love that the keyboard doesn’t come out from the unit when standing because I think that may make it hard to see the monitors.The issues I don’t like is that my desk is a standard height of 30 inches. You add the 5” for the Ergotron and and ~4.5” for the monitors and I’m constantly looking up at my monitors. I am going to have to purchase a chair that can raise height but still have my feet touch the ground to be able to see the monitors easily.Other than that, this is a great product and I’m glad I purchased it!",1

The top surface is big enough for my note book, papers, post its, and calculator.  And the keyboard area is a good size as well.  The only complaint, or more like suggestion for improvements, is that when moving it up I have to set it at the right height every time.

Ergonomics are excellent.  I'm 6'2"" and it works great.2. Solid as a rock.  I'm a big person and I can lean on it heavily and it doesn't move.  Yes you can make it rock a tiny bit, but it doesn't move a millimeter when I hammer away on my keyboard.3. Roomy.  I'm so glad I got the bigger TL.  Plenty of room on the keyboard stand for a standard keyboard and mouse.  The top platform has a 23"" monitor and my 15"" laptop with docking station.  There's still room for my calculator, iPhone, planner, etc.4. Good looking.  Yes, my desk looked better without this on top, but I was surprised by how professional it looks.  The fit and finish are excellent.  Several people have commented on that.5. It came with the nicest looking wire loom for the cables I've ever seen.  The self-adhesive cord holders that mount under the top surface just behind the keyboard stand (for the mouse and keyboard cables are slick.  I didn't need all the wire ties, they gave me or the rubber feet for the monitors, but there they were.6. I'm standing 3/4 of the time now.  I knew it would be helpful for my back &  health, but I underestimated how much more productive I would be standing than sitting.  When I want to sit, it's easy to lower.  Raising it back up again is a cinch.7. The straight up-down motion, as opposed to the ones that project forward when raised is a great feature.  I can't see any negative with it and if you have close quarters, it is invaluable.I could go on, but you get the idea.  I cannot encourage you enough to buy a cushioned surface to stand on.  However, don't blow your brains out with the specialty ones for sit/stand desks.  I bought an $18 one at Costco that was designed for kitchen use.Finally,  I don't write a lot of reviews, just for the products I love or hate.

It is very solidly built, steady as a rock, and beautifully engineered.  When typing there is no bouncing or wobbling of the platform, keyboard or monitors.  The adjustment from sitting to standing position is very easy and the mechanism is quite and very smooth and does not take a lot of strength to raise.  It takes just seconds raise or lower it.  The height adjustment is variable - the unit clicks into position to lock at the selected height when the spring-loaded handles on the left and right are released.  This means that you can easily raise it to whatever height you are comfortable with.  I am just over 70 inches tall and prefer it close to the maximum height.  At its lowest position it is not too obtrusive and I find that I do not have to adjust the monitor height at all when transitioning from sitting to standing and back again.The stand weighs about 70 lbs but setup is a breeze because it comes preassembled.  Just unpack it and place it on your desk, remove a few more packing materials, and you are good to go.  I originally ordered the Ergotron WorkFit Dual Monitor Kit (97-904) as well because I was concerned that with my two monitors (24"" diagonal screens) the stand would be unstable when raising and lowering it, but I ended up cancelling my order for the kit because the monitors sit very nicely on the stand and feel quite secure.  An added benefit of this arrangement is that I can move the monitors around to adjust their distance from my eyes and their relative angle, which I could not do if I mounted them to the stand using the kit.One thing I would note is that the dimensions on the Ergotron website imply that the unit is 23.25 inches deep but the keyboard tray projects an additional 4 inches so that total depth is about 27 inches.  This was not a problem for me because my desk is 30 inches deep.  Also I would say the color is charcoal grey not black, but that is fine too.  I am very happy with this stand and can recommend it without reservation.",2

I did some research and this brand is apparently the best. There is literally no set up except to put your stuff on it.I have two large monitors that fit perfectly on this stand. It is huge and heavy. Very very solid. It doesn’t jiggle with any movement. It’s a smooth loft and lower and not hard to do at all.

It fit pretty well with the back hanging off just a little bit but it’s still very sturdy.The set up was virtually nonexistent since it came ready to go. It definitely needs two people to lift onto the desk since it’s 50+ pounds. It’s super easy to lift into a standing position (which I do multiple times a day) and lower into a sitting position. I also love that the keyboard doesn’t come out from the unit when standing because I think that may make it hard to see the monitors.The issues I don’t like is that my desk is a standard height of 30 inches. You add the 5” for the Ergotron and and ~4.5” for the monitors and I’m constantly looking up at my monitors. I am going to have to purchase a chair that can raise height but still have my feet touch the ground to be able to see the monitors easily.Other than that, this is a great product and I’m glad I purchased it!",1

I was worried the construction would be cheap and wobbly.  But it's actually really solid.  It works really well.  I bought the monitor attachment so I could move it up and down when I stand and sit.  I think the ability to do that is important, and by using their attachment it frees up more space for my junk.  The top surface is big enough for my note book, papers, post its, and calculator.  And the keyboard area is a good size as well.  The only complaint, or more like suggestion for improvements, is that when moving it up I have to set it at the right height every time.

I returned to my company and ordered two sit/stand desks from another company to see how it would do. The desks were about $126 cheaper than this Ergotron model...you get what you pay for. They were pretty good but the up and down was VERY hard to do. The two guys I got them for had a hard time brining the desks up and down. I decided to buy four of these Ergotron WorkFit-TL, Sit-Stand Desktop Workstation, Black (33-406-085) to see how they compared to the two I purchased from Halter (Halter ED-258). There is no comparison. The Ergotron is so easy to raise and lower even with dual monitors on it. The workspace is so much better too. You definitely get what you pay for. I liked these four so much that I just purchased two more and now almost all of my guys will have a sit and stand desk. This Ergotron desk may be a bit more than most but you will not be disappointed. The keyboard space is long enough to hold the keyboard and a mouse. A great product so far!",2

Benton,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2017","I love my Ergotron sit/stand desktop converter! I researched a bunch of different brands before selecting this one. The biggest selling point for me was having easy-to-use FRONT levers to raise and lower the unit .  A lot of other models have the levers in the back of the unit and customer reviews stated how difficult it is for them to reach around the whole unit every time they need to raise or lower their unit. I bought the wider Ergotron model and I can tell you there's no way I would want to reach around back every time I want to raise or lower my unit. Having them right up front is the only way to go!!! Plus, the extra wide lever design makes it very easy to grab, unlock, and lock back into place.  An another unique design of the Ergotron that I really like is the way the entire unit raises and lowers straight up and down. It doesn’t expand outward, taking up more room like some of the other units. To me, these two features alone were well worth the extra money for this product.",2

I have 2 - 27"" monitors, speakers, and a microphone on the main desk platform and still have room for a paper notebook and other miscellaneous items on the surface. On the keyboard shelf I have the keyboard, mouse, and a few other small items.  The mechanism raises and lowers easily and is very stable. I was worried that it would move around as I wrote on the surface but that is not the case. I do have some minor movement when I type but I pound the keyboard pretty hard and have the desk at full extension. The movement is not enough to really bother me.

Well  made, very sturdy,  works  smoothly,  is easy to raise and lower (& I am over 75).  But be sure your monitor cables are long enough to  reach the desktop's highest level,  in case someone unfamiliar with your desktop gets hold of it -  it can move up pretty quickly if you don't have complete control over it when you depress the levers.  My two 27 inch monitors fit fine on top and tend to slow the upward lift,  but a single smaller monitor might be in danger if a child or unsuspecting visitor tried it out without warning. I researched this item fairly extensively and am glad I chose this model.  I use a largish keyboard &  like a good bit of room for my mouse;  width &  depth are OK,  but I wouldn't mind an extra inch of depth.  Nonetheless,  I find this a 5 star purchase.",1

After walking around the office and trying other people’s stand up desk, I was disappointed by how weak they felt, or how much they shook in the upright position, or how some models leaned out away from the desk when they were lifted up, or even how short or wide some of them are. Some of the desk even felt heavy lifting, so I took a gamble and bought this model. All I can say is that I Love It.

It went together easily, but the fit between the upright column and the base is just loose enough to allow the desk to wobble. Not much, but just enough to remind me how much I paid for a wobbly desk. The fit at the top of the column where it goes into the desk surface is also loose, allowing the desktop to twist a little. Again, just a little, but too much for the money.I use this standing desk with a laptop. Sometimes I come home to find that the desk has sunk by itself about six inches. My laptop is nowhere near the max weight load of the desk. When I lower the desk all the way it ""sticks"" a little, so that I have to pull up on it while holding the height adjustment lever to get it to come back up.Small gripes maybe, and if I had paid 25% of the asking price I might not care. At four bills Ergotron should be ashamed. Maybe I got a bad one, but I would expect more quality control for the money.The desk surface is just the right size and finished well. The wheels appear to be of high quality, and should be for the price. The bag hanger on the upright is too low to the ground to be of use for anything but a child's backpack. Overall the look is nice and the cup holder is a nice touch. If this desk performed as well as it looks I would buy more of them for the office.I bought an Anthro cart years ago and it still looks and works great. Unfortunately Ergotron does not make these types of carts anymore, so I have bought my last product from them.I am still using this desk but I do not recommend it.",0

It was designed very well, with the exception of one, critical part. The desk itself suffers from a serious flaw. The socket receiver on the base of the desk where the column is inserted uses a flimsy plastic sleeve to 'pinch' and lock the column in. However, there is too much play in the sleeve causing the entire column to move left, right, forward and backward. This naturally causes the desk to rotate and not be stable.",-1

Besides my 13 in laptop and mousepad, I can still place a small paper pad to write on. It is also deep enough to place a box of gloves behind the laptop. Another major advantage here is the storage area. I can secure my pens ad tools in the designated area.  Also, the accessory storage is a great addition. I have prescription pads, books, and medical equipment easily stored and need not leave the exam room to grab anything anymore.  I have everything with me.This thing is amazingly sturdy and well done. Very unusual to buy such a product nowadays.The only reason I did not give it a total 5 stars is the fact that the casters are small and are not easy to move the heavy desk across carpet/tile borders.  I almost have to lift the whole thing when I move between the tiled rooms and the carpeted hallways.I still love it more than my previous Ergotron Neo-flex cart. This is larger, sturdier, more ergonomic and more functional.",1

Yes, it is. No, it does not have presets or any of the other fanciness of electrically connected desk. In fact, I have a fancy electrical sit stand desk that collects dust because I prefer this desk to any other workstation?Since this is a review of a desk two years on, I will not cover assembly, but instead focus on durability and agility. Given the desk sees use every day, I am positively surprised that the pneumatic system which makes it super easy to move the desk up and down still moves as crisply as it did Day 1. It doesn't require, tugging, pushing or pulling the table. Pull the lever, and exactly the right amount of pressure is required to move the desk up or down. No frustration and also no unpleasant surprises. The desk itself has been scribbled on and I wiped it clean as if it were delivered the first day.Now let's talk about the most important feature. Agility. The wheels of the desk have seen use on hardwood floors, carpet, outdoor wood and stone. Through all surface and surface transitions, the wheels are still intact. In fact, the wear on the wheels is so minimal, that I'm genuinely fascinated at the construction of these. The desk swivels out of all tight spots and is highly maneuverable.Bottom Line: This is one of the few no regret purchases that has outlasted the pandemic. I have never proactively written a review for a product, but compelled to do so for a desk that has seriously been a true companion.",1

It went together easily, but the fit between the upright column and the base is just loose enough to allow the desk to wobble. Not much, but just enough to remind me how much I paid for a wobbly desk. The fit at the top of the column where it goes into the desk surface is also loose, allowing the desktop to twist a little. Again, just a little, but too much for the money.I use this standing desk with a laptop. Sometimes I come home to find that the desk has sunk by itself about six inches. My laptop is nowhere near the max weight load of the desk. When I lower the desk all the way it ""sticks"" a little, so that I have to pull up on it while holding the height adjustment lever to get it to come back up.Small gripes maybe, and if I had paid 25% of the asking price I might not care. At four bills Ergotron should be ashamed. Maybe I got a bad one, but I would expect more quality control for the money.The desk surface is just the right size and finished well. The wheels appear to be of high quality, and should be for the price. The bag hanger on the upright is too low to the ground to be of use for anything but a child's backpack. Overall the look is nice and the cup holder is a nice touch. If this desk performed as well as it looks I would buy more of them for the office.I bought an Anthro cart years ago and it still looks and works great. Unfortunately Ergotron does not make these types of carts anymore, so I have bought my last product from them.I am still using this desk but I do not recommend it.",0

Besides my 13 in laptop and mousepad, I can still place a small paper pad to write on. It is also deep enough to place a box of gloves behind the laptop. Another major advantage here is the storage area. I can secure my pens ad tools in the designated area.  Also, the accessory storage is a great addition. I have prescription pads, books, and medical equipment easily stored and need not leave the exam room to grab anything anymore.  I have everything with me.This thing is amazingly sturdy and well done. Very unusual to buy such a product nowadays.The only reason I did not give it a total 5 stars is the fact that the casters are small and are not easy to move the heavy desk across carpet/tile borders.  I almost have to lift the whole thing when I move between the tiled rooms and the carpeted hallways.I still love it more than my previous Ergotron Neo-flex cart.

Yes, it is. No, it does not have presets or any of the other fanciness of electrically connected desk. In fact, I have a fancy electrical sit stand desk that collects dust because I prefer this desk to any other workstation?Since this is a review of a desk two years on, I will not cover assembly, but instead focus on durability and agility. Given the desk sees use every day, I am positively surprised that the pneumatic system which makes it super easy to move the desk up and down still moves as crisply as it did Day 1. It doesn't require, tugging, pushing or pulling the table. Pull the lever, and exactly the right amount of pressure is required to move the desk up or down. No frustration and also no unpleasant surprises. The desk itself has been scribbled on and I wiped it clean as if it were delivered the first day.Now let's talk about the most important feature. Agility. The wheels of the desk have seen use on hardwood floors, carpet, outdoor wood and stone. Through all surface and surface transitions, the wheels are still intact. In fact, the wear on the wheels is so minimal, that I'm genuinely fascinated at the construction of these. The desk swivels out of all tight spots and is highly maneuverable.Bottom Line: This is one of the few no regret purchases that has outlasted the pandemic. I have never proactively written a review for a product, but compelled to do so for a desk that has seriously been a true companion.",1

Every part is sturdy and feels well made. The plastics are quality plastics. The dual-wheel casters are large and it rolls beautifully on hard surfaces and non-shag carpets. I use a Lamical laptop stand, and there is still room for a small mouse and full size keyboard. In fact if the stand is allowed to slip into the back channel there is also room for a notepad in front of the keyboard, but at that point, the laptop monitor is just a little too far away to be comfortable on the eyes. There are access holes in the plastic tray to allow cables easy access. I was worried about stability, some posts said the table wobbled or wasn't sturdy... All I can think of is maybe the top is not pushed all the way down, or possibly is reversed... not sure that's possible though. There is a plastic shim that is there as a pressure fitting to prevent the table from wobbling. As long as you follow the instructions and push the top down firmly and evenly it should be fine. Mine does not wobble at all. To clear up what accessories it comes with: It comes with the backpack hook pre-installed, but not with the bins for books and storage. I put two plastic bumpers on the back of the table-top, the small stick-on kind, so I can bump it into the brick wall and not scratch it. I love this thing. It adjusts easily up and down, and I can use that to match table height, with a nearby table, or use different chairs of varying height. Can also be used as a fully standing desk as well, and match the height of a kitchen counter. If you're looking for a portable desk or work surface, this is a quality product that works really well. It's a nice improvement over working at the kitchen table, now I can easily work anyplace in the house.",1

It just wasn't made quite that well, and did not have the positioning abilities that I wanted, plus it wasn't tall enough for my standing desk. This arm is much, much better - it's very well made and holds my monitor very securely. It's also very easy to move the monitor to just about any position I want with very little effort. So it works for my stand up/sit down workstation, which is just what I needed. Why four stars? Because I am 5'2"" tall and this are does not have the height I was looking for. Unless there's an adjustment that I don't know about, maybe. From what I've seen, it looks like the top arm is at its highest position just like in the picture on Amazon. I can get the monitor to go down, but no further up. It's impossible to tell from the very scanty instructions which joints are repositionable and which aren't, so maybe I just don't know how to get it to go higher.  And I also may be too picky, but I want my monitor at eye height so I don't have to look down at all, I want to be able to look straight ahead and have my information straight in front of me.  This arm is about 3"" too short of that. So I have the extension arm on order, and am hoping that will give me the extra couple of inches I want for this arm to be perfect for me. However, this is just a personal preference. Other than that, this is a great piece of equipment, it looks like it's built to last forever!!!! Easy to install, too, even with the crappy instructions. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to be able to reposition a computer monitor regularly, especially if you're in a stand up/sit down workstation like I am. This arm is just perfect for that, with the exception of the height problem. And that may not be a problem for anyone else. If anyone out there knows how to adjust that top arm to go higher than the approximately 45 degree angle it's at please let me know!  Overall, very well worth the money and I'm glad I shelled out the extra bucks to move up to this arm from the one I had.Update: I received the extension piece for this monitor arm that is sold here on Amazon. It's basically the same piece as the part that attaches to the pole. It took all of a minute to install and re-position my wiring, and the height problem was solved! Now my monitor is at eye height, which is exactly what I was trying to get accomplished. So now this is a five star review! If you're interested in the extension arm, it's the Ergotron 45-289-026 Mounting Extension. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but it solved my very irritating problem, so it was well worth the money. My workstation is now set up exactly the way I want it, with no eye, neck, or back strain from bending over just a little to get closer to my monitor screen. This is an excellent, heavy duty product and I can see no reason why it should ever need replacement. Here's the link:

It is beautifully designed and made.  It is quite heavy & sturdy.  The design is superb.  The parts are all made of heavy duty steel and bolted together with fine screws.  There are 2 Allen wrenches for adjustments.  I used the through table mount but there is also a C-clamp mount.  It can be used with 1 or 2 arms depending on your needs and size of the space.  I used 1 arm.  The instructions that came with it were detailed and excellent.  I had no trouble assembling and installing it.  There are also on-line instructions and several videos at the website of the manufacturer.  It is fairly expensive for a mounting, but it is a pleasure to have and use.  I expect it will last a lifetime.As the instructions note, it is difficult or impossible to move it well until the VESA plate is screwed onto the monitor.  After that, it is readily moved.  The Allen screws and be adjusted to more or less tightness.",2

The cheaper ones are no more than clugs with badly fitting parts and whose screws need to be loosened, if they haven't been stripped, if you want to move the monitor position. In its price range and above I haven't yet found a decent competitor except for the Humanscale M2 or M8. The LX is a well made, nicely designed, unit well worth the price.At first, it wouldn't hold my monitor up -- the upper arm kept sinking -- and yet my monitor, at 15.4 lbs., was well below the 20 lb. max capacity for this unit. The adjustment for the weight of the monitor is #2 on the scant pictographic instructions. The picture instructions are not the best--not the worst but. . . Anyway I searched for an adjustment to the spring-tension canister in the upper arm that counterbalances the monitor's weight. Pushing the upper arm up and the screen mount down reveals the adjustment screw head at the end of the canister and the larger supplied wrench fits it. 3 half-turns clockwise made no diff. So I added three more half-turns; better but still slowly sinking. I added a 3 more half-turns--much better. 3 more for a total of 12 half-turns and the balance was perfect. You need to ease your way up to the right number of turns to get it just right balance and to avoid overtightening. Once adjusted correctly, the montoro stays in palce but can be moved easily up and down.What's nice about this unit is that, once you have it set up, you can move the monitor around and up and down without readjusting the tension or loosening/retigthening any screws. Although, if your desk is on casters or wheels, you will want to lock them, which is a good safety rule anyway. The elevation movement is smooth and easy--you can move it up or down with one finger. The horizontal swing movement is much stiffer. It helps if you spray the two large post joints with silicone lubricant liberally and then wipe away thoroughly all of the excess. This won't make the swing movement light, but it does ease it up a bit. By post joints I mean the large joints where the upper arm meets the lower and were the lower arm meets the desk mounting post. These joints have no bearings; they have plastic sleeve-type bushings. Compared to the Humanscale: the Humanscale moves horizontally as easily as the LX moves vertically while the Humanscale moves vertically as stiffly as the LX moves horizonstally--either way I'm not sure the difference is worth the extra money for the Humanscale. This stiff horizontal movement is less than ideal but far better than what I've seen on some of the cheaper units offer. For this price I could live with stiffness given all the other postive features.The LX comes with a heavy duty clamp base and a drill-a-hole-in-the-desk grommet type mount--both come in the box. All of the parts are in a two-layer plastic strip, sealed into multiple compartments with each compartment labeled as to contents. Much better than those units that come with all the screws etc. all in one bag and you have to sort them by count and looks against their picture in the instructions.It's not quite as pretty as the Humanscale M2 or M8, which cost about 60% more, but much more nicely finished than the cheaper units I've seen up close. The LX, with less attractive desk mounting pole, has a greater range of vertical position than the Humanscale.If you can afford it, this monitor arm is a very good choice. If you can afford more, then it's a tough choice between this at its price vs the Humanscale arms at the higher prices. For the money, this is a much better deal, thus, my rating of 5 stars.",2

This arm is expensive, but honestly for something you can keep using its worth the premium.  I always thought a monitor arm is a monitor arm but this product changed my perception of that.This arm has very smooth motion, very easy to move it around and dial in the right setting you need for the situation. Once you got it positioned it is extremely sturdy and stays where you set it.  You can continually adjust this thing with ease, no need to mess with tension screws or jank actions.It looks slick in matte black, which is a lot nicer than the plastic or shiny materials used in other mounts.  Not really a big deal but its sometimes the small details.Installation was easier than any other arm i've installed. The parts are laid out properly and the way it goes together in parts is a lot more smooth than other designs.  Its pretty much 3 lego pieces and you're done, the base is just a base so its not top heavy while you're trying to secure it to your desk.  Monitor cant be nut locked in place so you have to remove the entire last segment to replace your screen, but that adds to the stability of the monitor as it doesn't shake at all.Having a screw to disable rotation is great for my OCD tendencies, you can get very slight rotation but getting it fully strait takes zero effort, no need for rulers.",1

Sadly it is the most expensive. Here is what made a difference to me:1: Stable (other products as well, but this one FEELS stable whereas the others do not)2: Assembly (best in class - including heavy monitor installation)3: Ease of use (best in class - easy to maneuver, easy to move, stays put)4: Aesthetics (bought the aluminum version and it looks really good)5: Quality (this is by far the heaviest, beefiest, well made product in its line)The cons list is short:1: Price (it's expensive, but has from what I can see a best in class warranty offsetting a lot of the inherent cost)2: The set screw ring eats into the back of the post. I wish they would have used a channel or something to help remedy the digging in. This will in time show to my room.3: There is no limiter like the HX (however no others I have used has this to my knowledge)My setup:-----  ------------ -----|  | |  | |  ||2K | |  4K  | | 2K||  | |  | |  |-----  ------------ -----Each of the 2k 27"" monitors use this product.The 43"" 4k monitor uses the Ergotron HX.The 2k left back faces the room. The 4k back faces the corner of my desk. The 2k right is up against a wall.My right monitor is mounted 11"" from the wall with 1/4 gap from the wall to the arm. Math is needed to get it right, so be cautious. The HX has a limiter on the arm.On the cons, I can look past the price as it is a buy once cry once item and a 10 year warranty which means this will definitely outlast my other arms I have in other rooms at a fraction of the cost increase in price over the other items I would trust my expensive monitors to. I have had this monitor setup for 6 years and will likely continue to do so for my workstation. It is PLENTY of space for all my VMs, documents, photo editing, side browser window TV, and communication platform. I expect these arms to last at least 10 years, but if they don't and the warranty does NOT cover something, I will buy another set. I do not expect any of my other monitor arms to last past 3 years.Another item to check out based on my findings: the AVTL is the 2nd heaviest duty mount I found. For non-critical mounting, that is a good mount in my opinion. HOWEVER, I do not know the US presence of the company and do not know how long the mount will last with its 3 year warranty.I am not saying this is the best mount out there but it works for me. I have another room with the AVLT Dual 13""-43"" Mount. I paid less than $190 after tax. The same dual monitor setup here cost almost $650. I do expect to come close to the same cost per year on both items (with the Ergotron edging out slightly at $65 per year vs AVTL $63.33 per year if it lasts the full warranty term). HOWEVER, if you compare apples to apples and do not use a dual monitor mount, now the value is with the Ergotron. The same setup with AVTL as I have on my main workstation (3 single arm mounts) would have cost around $450 after tax whereas the full Ergotron setup set me back $955. Now the cost per year is in the favor of Ergotron for sure as one of my monitors is at the brink of breaking 33lbs (so I did not want to use the almost at limit arm from AVTL where I couldn't find their US presence easily).I hope this helps someone else out there make their decision but I do NOT have any buyers remorse (but I just got them installed today so... YMMV)",0

It's very solidly built, fairly well thought out, and once set up it adjusts easily.  When I unpacked, I was surprised at how heavy it was -- it is really solid.  There are a couple of small caveats but they aren't enough to diminish my rating.First, the adjustment for the counter-spring for the vertical movement is next to impossible.  The design calls for inserting an Allen wrench into the area behind the joint where the monitor mounting plate is attached to engage the rod which controls the spring tension.  First, it is pointless to try the adjustment without the monitor in place since it is the monitor's weight one is attempting to counterbalance, and that means that the monitor will make it impossible to see into the recessed area where the wrench needs to go.  There is nothing in there to guide the wrench so it is practically impossible to fit it into the hex-head on the end of the rod.  Meanwhile, with the monitor and other parts of the arm in the way one cannot just continually turn the wrench -- one must turn it, then remove it and reorient it before inserting it again -- so even getting lucky at getting the wrench seated the first time won't help much.  Lucky for me that the factory setting was almost perfect for my monitor so I didn't have to monkey with this that much.  It is a bad design and I hope they are smart enough to change it for future offerings.My second caveat is really minor, but it just seems like they could have easily handled it better.  One installation option involves installing the arm on a surface by running a bolt in the platform of the arm through a hole in the table's surface and then using a wingnut to clamp a small plate underneath the mounting surface.  This works well but the bolt is very long -- I'm not sure why they need a bolt that long.  In my case, there was a drawer beneath the surface where I was mounting it and the excess length of the bolt interfered with the drawer.  One option to fix this is to use a shorter bolt -- that might not be easy to do, however.Where the bolt fits through the platform of the arm, it drops into a square hole and the bolt has a square section at the top of its shaft which locks into that square hole to keep the bolt from turning.  It might not be that easy to find a replacement bolt with that square section as I suspect that it is not a standard part.  Another option is to take a hack saw and cut off the excess portion of the bolt.  Unless there is sufficient room in the mounting area to accommodate a hack saw, this would entail mounting the arm, marking the place to cut the bolt and then removing the arm to retrieve the bolt (and one would likely need a vise to hold the bolt while cutting).  It would have been easy to avoid all of this, however.  The bolt itself is at the bottom of the hollow upright tube which the arm is mounted on -- if they had just welded a nut to the platform and threaded the bolt through a lock-nut, then the welded nut, it could be adjusted to whatever height was desired before installing.  To avoid having to install, mark the bolt, and then remove for adjustment, one could likely just estimate the length needed based on the surface on which it is to be mounted (to be fair, one could do the same with the hacksaw method but with the downside of needing to obtain a new bolt if the estimated length turned out to be too short).One last complaint involves the provisions for cable control -- the cavity in the arm for passing the cables is a little awkward to use and seems a bit small.  It works well enough, however -- the real problem is that there is nothing similar for the upper arm and since a little slack is needed in the cables to allow for moving the monitor around, angling the screen, etc., one is faced with having cables drooping down behind the monitor.  I alleviated this a bit by using some velcro ties to hold the cables to the upper arm so that the slack portion is only from the end of the arm to the monitor.These are minor quibbles, however, and only affect the setup.  Once the arm is in place and adjusted, it works great, easily holds my 22 inch monitor, and I am very happy with it.",1

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",1

It took me over an hour to get the cheaper ones setup, also I could never quite get them at the right height + depth + tilt all at the same time.With these it takes a few minutes tops to setup and you can place them in pretty much any position as long as you leave 1-3 inches of space behind your desk. Definitely recommend them if you can afford them but the budget ones will get you by. Generally I think this is a product you buy once.One recommendation I would make is for dual monitors getting two separate poles for more customizability. It's a bit more expensive but I've found sharing a pole can limit the range of motion if you have two large monitors.",1

The ""tightness"" of it's adjustable parts clearly old, and the base it scratched up.  Also the box looked warn and everything about it feels like I got porked into paying for a new item but received a clearly used and worn one.  The problem is I need this now and don't have 2 weeks to wait for another one.  First time I've ever had to submit a negative review of something I purchased on Amazon.  And it's too bad Ergotron has to get a low review from a customer because of Ingram's poor service. I would imaging that this LX Arm would be nice if it didn't seem like it was used for the last year.  It doesn't seem tight and the adjustments don't hold the secondary pivot arm in place that well.  The construction quality is pretty good, but again it seems like it was used by someone at Ingram for a while before they packaged it back up and shipped it out to me.  Maybe someone will sent me a NEW one and I can return this.  I need it now.",-1

The bolts initially didn't move at all and I noticed green goopy machine screw grease messily spread around the parts where the bolts screw in.

It took less than 6 mos for this to happen. Ergotron is a large company. They are well staffed. Customer service immediately let me know Ergotron doesn't sell any of these parts.

BUT... I was disappointed that they sent open box, previously installed product. If I'm paying a premium price for an arm this shouldn't be. It installed ok and it will hopefully have no issues. I need it now or I would send it back without hesitation. To begin with, none of the main arm parts were sleeved. I assume it comes that way because an empty sleeves had been tossed back in the box, but no one bothered to re-sleeve anything. The hardware pouch had been opened in 3 places (Poked finger holes. So tacky!). Both Allen wrenches were missing. I have a butt-load of tools so I was able to find the right wrenches but many people might not.  One of the arm finishing caps was loose and rolling around in the box (had been taken out of the pouch). Adjusting screws for one of the joints and the front tension had been tightened all the way in. The screw head on the tensioning screw showed metal filings and heavy scratches indicating it had been worked quite a lot with a wrench. The instructions were crumpled and obviously used. Not a big deal but again, it all felt like getting used product and I'm left wondering what other paper work might have been missing. I'm holding my breath there are no other issues with it. Its seems to be working fine for now but still wondering why it was sent back which I assume is the case. Check out what you get carefully. I recommend sending it back if its been opened and you can spare the wasted time. This should have been inspected and sold as refurbished product with a new hardware pouch tossed in at the very least. My review may be an anomaly. If so, go for it.",-1

I was extremely disappointed by its build quality and design - the mounting clamp relies on cheap mini-screws that offer a poor range of mounting options and scratch your desk. The base mount and the arm support connections don't feel sturdy, and the 'safe-screws' that 'connect and lock the arms' are poorly designed, scratching the own arm junction to offer more 'resistance' to the joint.Don't get me wrong, this product is not TERRIBLE itself - but it is definitely not worth this price to the point it looks like a scam brand.Check the picture that I uploaded here: that upper ring goes up and down freely on the main base stick, and the ONLY thing that holds it in place is that tiny screw that bruises the paint. It also stays in place due to an offset motion stress that the monitor weight generates when mounted.The arm joints don't feel secure at all for frequent motion.I bought both models for my desk setup and I deeply regret the amount of money I spent on them.",-1

It works well when installed, and I am happy. However, QC is an issue and not everyone will have the ability to troubleshoot these issues if they're less than fortunate with their order.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I may have gotten a faulty product, but it's impossible to loosen some of the adjustment screws. I mean literally. The screws are different sizes and the tool they provide you (and refer to in the manual for all of them) does not fit every size. I had to strip their tool to fit the smaller ones, which made it unusable for larger ones. Using my own tools to try to un-jam them (thankfully I own a set of Allen wrenches), they're stuck on radically tight, again, following the directions in the manual. It's lovely to put together and very simple. I can tell the range of motion is excellent when not-faulty, but I was expecting this arm to be the end of my cursed journey buying gas spring arms, and this was one of 5 disappointments in a row. I might need to suck it up and invest in the Wacom Flex, sadly.",-1

However, I missed the fine print that states the grommet mount does not come with the white option. I looked for it in the box and it wasn’t there. I checked the product page again and sure enough, the piece doesn’t come in the box if you choose white for some reason. I cannot think of a good reason for this other than getting customers to spend another $20-$30 on this piece if they wanted a white monitor arm to match their white monitor.

A very slight movement of the table, such as might result from moving a mouse, causes an objectionable amount of vibration of the monitor.  Apparently, the arm acts as a lever and magnifies the tiny initial vibration, making it quite noticeable.  Another problem is that my table is only 24"" from front to rear, and the back of the monitor needs to be aligned with the back edge of the table for optimum viewing.  The best I can do is to get the back of the monitor 3 1/2"" from the back edge of the table, at which point the middle of the monitor is 3"" to the right of the center of the table.  It may be possible to adjust the monitor to get it closer to the back of the table and centered, but there are no instructions included with the arm on how to do this, and my attempts to adjust it  have been frustrating.  Finally, there are two hooks on the bottom of the top arm so you can tie the power and video signal cables up out of the way; unfortunately, the hooks are shallow, and moving the arm often dislodges the ties attached to the cables. I paid a lot of money for this arm, but it does not do what I need it to do.",-1

Undoubtedly, it is a sold monitor arm, made well and built to last. The issue that I had, however, is that the adjustments were far too hard to make. After loosening the adjustments for the swivel (monitor angle) and the extension (up and down), it was still far too difficult to do without making direct adjustment to the arm itself. Pushing on the monitor did almost nothing. In fact, while I was pushing on the monitor, the monitor arm popped of the base and hit my desk, putting an annoying dent in my brand new desk! After some adjustment, I was able to prevent the arm from leaving the base, but it was still far to difficult.I have rarely had such an immediately negative reaction to a product. I have already processed a return. I only wish I could return the dent it made in my desk!",-1

The manufacturer of the arm refers you to Apple.  You discover this after you receive the arm.  When you receive the adaptor from Apple you discover it doesn't fit your iMac.  You contact Apple and they refer you to another third party that will supply you an adaptor for $80.00.  At this point you may do as I did and send everything back or opt to drill holes in your iMac stand and tap them with threads to match the arm.Keep in mind that with this arm you no longer can simply pick up your iMac and take it with you without first removing the four bolts connecting the arm to your iMac.,-2

It looks smart and stylish with its silver and black colours.2.  It feels solid and robust.  Well engineered, not flimsy or wobbly.  The desk clamp in particular is solid as a rock.3.  Price was reasonable (reduced to about £106 from £160) cheaper than similar - e.g. Flo.4.  Frees up desk space underneath. (Ie it is a monitor arm!)Weak points1.  Has no way (as far as I can tell) to stop the ""elbow"" swivelling right back and banging the wall behind the desk.  Some rival products do have this feature.  I have worked around this by altering the position of the clamp sideways relative to where I position the monitor usually.  It's not easy to explain, but now when I push the monitor away the front arm swivels more than the back one so I don't bash the wall.2.  It is not easy to put the monitor exactly where I want it.  For example, It doesn't want to move straight up and down - the movement is more curved because of the way the arm articulates.  So it kind of moves sideways as well as up/down.  I can overcome this, but i have to wrestle with it a bit.  Likewise moving fwd or back, the screen does not automatically stay straight.3.  The biggest problem by far is that it is NOT HIGH ENOUGH.  It was ok (just) at max height, until I raised my seat slightly to improve my sitting posture - but I can't raise the monitor any higher.  The claimed height range of 18 inches is totally misleading.  The arm's lowest position (without a monitor attached) is touching the desk.  The highest position is 18"" above the desk.  But with a monitor attached it won't go so low of course.  So the actual range is only 12"".  And who would want their monitor touching the desktop anyway???  With my 19"" monitor attached the top of my screen is 22"" from the desktop.  It needs to be about 24"".Ergotron make a tall pole version of this product - I would recommend anyone reading this review to buy that version instead so you get 5 inches more height. (I am a very average height male by the way.  Not super tall.).I contacted Ergotron (in Holland) to try to get a tall pole.  They do NOT sell it separately.  The person I spoke to was very helpful and would have sent one free if they had one available - but they didn't.  It was looking like I would have to send the whole thing back.  But I found a small local engineering company that made me a new pole for £30.  (This includes cutting a thread into it so it screw into the base - it's not just a pole, it's a bit more complicated than that!).  This was still cheaper than buying the tall pole version because the short pole version is currently reduced by £60.  But all in all a frustrating experience, because why why why do they sell this poorly designed version at all???One last point - I think all the similar arms such as Flo have equally flawed design.  In fact they are worse - at least Ergotron offer the tall pole version.",-1

Huge dissapointment here.I followed carefully the instructions and out of the 5 adjustments the 2 closer to the monitor mount are barely moving. The rest of movements -these regarding the two arms-  i.e. 360 degrees rotating and up-down arm lift are ok.The forward (down) tilt just behind the monitor is practically impossible, although the bolt is unscrewed to the very end!!! The opposite, (backwards tilt) is a little easier but neverthelss hard...! I recall this problem was emphasized by another amazon reviewer here. The same happens with the 180 degrees ""horizontal level turning"" which occurs just behind the mount. This one has not even an option of fastening or loosening something which implies that should have come factory adjusted...In conclusion if I dare to make these 2 adjustmets -even for just a little bit- the force that I need to use on the monitor is so much that I am afraid of damaging it.The result is that after purchasing a L(u)X arm... practically I am only left to adjust the monitor position only by the ""2 arms adjustments"" plus using wisely the long pole and position on desk to mitigate the loss.It looks like that Ergotron is designed to work properly only with 10-11 kg monitors. Normally when the adjustment mechanisms compensate this type of weight the result should be easier and smoother movements. But this narrowing of optimal use consists a serious DESIGN FLAW for lighter monitors (that are certainly included in Ergotron list!!!) and the consumers that are attracted by the design and the quality of the materials, must be properly informed.This design flow means dissatisfaction for me regarding the Ergotron LX. Especially for the price.",-1

The clamp is pretty thick so if you have anything under your table it may get in the way of the clamp.

If you aren't, ignore the following.If you want to save 40 dollars, and improve upon what you bought, go to the hardware store, buy a 1"" schedule 80 pre threaded aluminum tube, and please buy aluminum the base is also cast aluminum and if you cheap out and buy cast iron, you will have serious problems with the base and tube welding itself together and destroying whatever paint or coating you use to finish your new tube.  And yes, you need schedule 80 tubing if you're making it longer.  Take apart your stand, its 3 screws holding on a plate that hides the threaded portion of the stand, and remove 3 more insert screws around the circumference of the base.  From there you should be able to easily unscrew the tube, though if you have trouble, use a bit of heat and can easily remove your old tube.From here on, cut your new tube arm to your desired length, file the sharp edges, paint it black, take your old tube cap off, pop it on the new one, and reassemble.  At most you're spending 5 dollars on aluminum tubing, and 5 more on a pipe cutter if you don't have one or a saw.  The tube itself should take well to any kind of paint, or you can just leave it unpainted because aluminum doesn't rust for that hip industrial look.The rest of the arm itself is really well built, if annoying to adjust as it has a very limited range of motion, and the process of finely tuning exactly where the dials need to sit so you can actually move the arms, is unfathomably narrow.  Too much and you're fighting the arm to move it up, too little and your monitor is dragging the arm down.  After messing around with it for far too long, I took it apart, degreased and regreased all the parts, and it adjusted a lot better.That being said, while the build quality is pretty outstanding, its got too many problems to recommend in the slightest.You get what you pay for, but that's it unfortunately.  With a bit of work, you could make it absolutely exceptional.  But to pay an extra 40 dollars for a longer tube is absurd, and an extra 10 on that for white paint, is worse.  Just spend the 200 dollars and get something better, with a wider, more easily done degree of adjustment.",-1

The two arms move well and can be steered without requiring great effort.The Cons: Assembly Instructions are minimal. The tilt and swing joints just before the monitor (circled in red in the picture), are too stiff and with too much stick, even after adjusting tilt to least tension. The swing joint is not adjustable at all. The stiffness of those joints makes fine tuning the monitor position difficult.My monitor is a Dell 27"", 9.7lbs (no stand). That's within the capacity range of the Ergotron LX arm (capacity: 7-25 lbs.) but near the low end of the range.Compared to my other monitor arm (Fully Jarvis), I  was disappointed in the Ergotron LX. It was more expensive and highly rated, but did not work as well with my monitor. Overall, it failed to meet my expectations. It may be better suited for heavier monitors. I will try it for a week and see what else can be done, but might send it back.Postscript: I re-read the reviews and it seems other people have experienced the same issues. I decided to return the arm.",-1

For a top-tier price, some things feel cheap or poorly thought out. Examples:1) To adjust the arm height on the monitor's pole, you use a screw to hold tension. Even cheap monitor arms have a rubber/plastic gasket that tightens along with the screw or hex, protecting the pole. This does not - the screw goes directly into the white pole's paint and chipping it immediately. If you have to adjust it several times, you're chipping the paint even more. That means if you ever move your desk or have it facing a room, you're going to see bare metal poking out.2) The cable management is pathetic. Ergotron gives you zip ties - ZIP TIES. A plastic piece or elastic band would have been far more useful and looked way cleaner.Here are the great strengths of the product:1) Looks great, with the highest quality base I've ever used2) Lots of flexibility for a monitor arm",0

The vice portion is sturdy on top but a bit underwhelming below and doesn’t close tight enough to fit most desks, I had to put a piece of wood beneath it. Also there is no padding for the top which I remedied with foam to stop it digging into my desk. Product works great, I just feel for the price of it, it should come with higher quality desk mount adjustments.If purchasing for Cintiq or drawing monitor, it is solid when tightened. If it wobbles at all I haven’t noticed. The arm is solid and heavy.",1

It did make me question the quality of this mount...Otherwise, the mount is OK. I have a 24 inch screen mounted and works according to the specs. It has two joints on the main frame that rotates freely, and it has one tilt joint at the screen base (also has rotation). It is nice for watching movies. It is quite 'heavy duty'. Most of the parts are metal (except the plastic insert). You could seriously hurt someone if you decided to wack him on the head with this mount.",0

This arm did not go up as high as I need it to, and I'm average height (5'7""). When it says the arm goes up 13 inches, that means most typical monitors (mine is 20"") will be only about 10 inches off your desk at the base. Not high enough if you are sitting/standing with correct posture.My husband cleverly fixed this by cutting a block of wood to fit underneath the base of the unit to give me the height I need (essentially, the clamp encompasses my desk and an inch-thick block of wood). Other than the limited height range, I am very happy with the product.",1

This arm was provided by my employer, I have it holding a Dell U3415w monitor that has a VESA mount rating of 18.60lbs, which is below the 20 lb rating that Ergotron states for the LX Desk arm.Installation was a breeze and it really is a quality stand, it is far more adjustable than my existing stand  I had for my previous dual-display (24"" monitors) setup..but it is apparent that adjustability has tradeoffs.When installing heavier monitors you do need to follow the instructions and adjust the tension of the arm resistance of the monitor will slowly (or perhaps rather quickly) ""settle"" to a lower height (if the tension was too great a light monitor may do the opposite and rise).I am somewhat disappointed as the monitor has a ""wobble"" to it when mounted on the LX Desk Mount LCD Arm.  This cannot be taken away by adjusting tension, as it is give within the physical components (that felt so solid when I took it out of the box).  I have an adjustable height desk, and when in the ""standup"" height the desk has a bit of a shake to it when I am typing...with the Ergotron LX that results in the monitor swaying side-to-side, and in a clock/anti-clock-wise orientation (even with the rotation locking screw in place).This would likely be a great stand for a desk that was wall mounted or otherwise very sturdy, but an adjustable height desk will always have a bit of give in it.  My previous stand does not exhibit this problem, for this monitor or the previous ones...and that stand was 1/3 the price tag of this arm.  I feel I will accept losing adjustability and go for stability and buy a different arm for my use.",-1

Immediately obvious that it is a high quality product.The arm will support monitors up to 25lbs and 34”.The tall pole is about twice the length of the normal desk mount and it increases the height you can set the monitor at by about seven inches. The arm, shown in the photos, that sits on the pole is actually optional. You can choose whether to fit that or not. This is where the long pole comes in to play really because that first arm adds four inches or so to the monitor height so if you choose not to fit that arm then you will most likely need the longer pole to achieve a good height for the monitor.The normal arm puts the monitor centre at about 15 inches above the desk max so the long mount so this increases that to about 22 inches max. However I found the arm was most happy at a little less than maximum.The pole comes with two mounting options. Through a hole or a table top clamp. The “through a hole” mount requires an 8 to 51mm hole, and can manage a desk up to 57mm thick. The clamp can manage up to 60mm thick desks. The through the hole method there is a steel plate that fit underneath the desk that can be screwed to the desk  I used the clamp and found that in fact it would go a little further than 60mm, I measured 65mm.The one annoyance with the arm is that there is a small steel shim underneath the screw adjustment for the arms. The shims measure about half an inch square. During my experimenting these kept falling out when I disassembled the stand. Just keep an eye out for them. There is a notch cut in to the aluminium behind the hex screws and they slot in with the curve facing away from the screw. You have to remove the inner plastic sleeve to see the slot clearly although you can see it if you turn the arm upside down.I did discover that you need the tension higher than you probably think you do! If you gently rock the table back and forth, if the tension is not high enough then the monitor will lose height. Adjust the tension until this doesn’t happen.I also found that it was much safer to attach the second arm to the monitor before you fit it to the rest of the arm. It’s just easier to do this than to try to fit the monitor afterwards.Oh and be careful when you are DIY’ing it, aluminium marks easily.Something I really liked were the screws that it uses to attach to the monitor. These are tool-less, which makes it a lot easier...no screwdriver to drop. Ordinary screws are provided if you prefer the higher security.In the end I actually returned the product. The reason was that the monitor just wobbled too much as I typed. Looking at the stand I realised this was the “ball joint” directly behind the monitor. It just isn’t rigid enough and I suspect that is because it’s too small. The entire monitor wobbled clockwise anti-clockwise. So no, after all that messing around, it didn’t suite me. Personally I think one of these wall mounted would suit me much better. That way there is no reason why it should wobble. If the wobble bothers you then don't bother, but if you are fine with it then you could do a lot worse than this great looking stand.",2

Ich habe mich letzten Endes doch für 3 Sterne entschieden. In der Rezension vergleiche ich diesen Monitorarm mit dem ca. 60€ teureren Monitorarm ""Flo"" von CBS (auch auf Amazon erhältlich -> leider nur in weiß)Um es gleich vorwegzunehmen: Der Monitorarm macht im Prinzip einen guten Job bzw. das wozu er gedacht ist. Er hält bzw. hielt hier bei mir einen 27 Zoll Monitor, der ca. 4,5 Kg schwer ist, ohne Probleme und sehr stabil.Kommen wir einmal zu den positiven Punkten:- Der Monitorarm kommt gut verpackt, mit allem Zubehör- Neben der klassischen Befestigung per Tischklemme, ist im Lieferumfang auch eine Befestigung über ein ""grommet hole"" also einem Loch im Schreibtisch vorhanden- Die Tischklemme kann direkt per Drehknauf am Tisch befestigt werden bzw. sodass kein Sechskantschlüssel bzw. Werkzeug gebraucht wird. Dies ist sehr praktisch, da man nicht unbedingt unter dem Tisch herum kriechen muss um die Klemme zu befestigen -> Das ist klasse :)- Neben normalen Schrauben für den ""VesaMount"" liegen ebenfalls Schrauben bzw. ""ThumbScrews"" bei, welche ohne Werkzeug befestigt werden können bzw. um den eigentlichen Monitor am Arm zu befestigen -> Das ist ebenfalls sehr klasse und praktisch :)- Der Monitorarm selbst gliedert sich in 3 Teile bzw. einmal den Fuß mit Stange (welcher am Schreibtisch fest gemacht wird), einem ersten Arm welcher auf die Stange geschoben wird und einem zweiten Arm welcher auf den erste gesteckt wird. Das ganze wird über Kunststoffgewinde gehalten bzw. machte einen stabilen und guten ersten Eindruck. Weiter ist der komplette Monitorarm, neben der Abdeckung für das Kabelmanagement, aus schwarzen matten Aluminium was sehr schön aussieht.- Der Standfuß des Monitorarms ist recht groß geraten bzw. größer als bei den meisten anderen Monitorarmen. Komplett aus Aluminium macht er ein sehr stabilen Eindruck bzw. gerade für große Monitore. Ob es wirklich ein Vorteil gegenüber einem kleinerem Standfuß ist sei dahingestellt bzw. ist rein subjektiv von mir ;)Jetzt einmal die negative Seite:Ist der Monitor einmal befestigt und der Arm justiert, wird der Monitor hier zumindest ohne Probleme gehalten. Jedoch ist das Justieren recht fummelig, da teils nur eine recht grobe Einstellung möglich ist. Dies betrifft vor allem das ""Tilt"" bzw. die Neigung (X-Achse) des Monitorarms. Wie schon andere beschrieben haben ist hier, selbst auf leichtester Stufe, das Neigen so schwergängig das man 2 Hände und gut Kraft braucht. Ich könnte mir vorstellen das dies bei einem schwereren Monitor einfacher geht.Das Hochfahren und Absenken des Monitorarms ist einigermaßen leicht. Durch die einfache Steckverbindung der zwei Arme wirkt dies aber teils etwas wackelig, da sich die Kraft nicht auf die Feder für das Hochfahren auswirkt sondern auf die Steckverbindung, wodurch diese ab und an leicht mit angehoben wird.Die Drehbewegungen (Y-Achse) der Monitorarme sind ausreichend leichtgängig. Die Drehbewegung (Y-Achse) direkt am Monitor dafür leider überhaupt nicht bzw. viel zu schwer (leider kann man diese auch nicht justieren).Fazit und Vergleich zum CBS ""Flo"" Monitorarm:Die schwergängige Bewegung des Arms, ist für mich der Hauptpunkt für die 3 Sterne Bewertung. Für rund 140€ sollte man hier doch mehr erwarten können bzw. zumindest ein leichtgängiges Verstellen des Arms mit einer Hand. Dies ist hier leider nicht gegeben. Diesen Arm gibt es jedoch noch in der  AmazonBasics Variante gut 40€ billiger -> (Einschränkungen hierbei: Es können wohl keine Erweiterungen von Ergotron benutzt werden und der Garantiezeitraum ist kürzer). Wäre der Arm für 70€ bis 100€ erhältlich hätte ich gesagt OK das passt bzw. da dies neben der Einschränkung hinsichtlich der Bewegbarkeit ein guter Monitorarm ist.Möchte man jedoch die Monitorposition des öfteren neu ausrichten, kann ich nur zum 60€ teureren CBS Monitorarm raten. Bei diesem Arm wird auf eine Steckverbindung verzichtet bzw. kann die Federeinstellung des Arms, über eine Anzeige abgelesen werden, wodurch das Justieren deutlich einfacher ist. Weiter ist der Monitorarm wesentlich leichtgängiger und trotzdem sehr stabil. Der im Verhältnis geringe Aufpreis lohnt sich hier meiner Meinung deutlich mehr. Daher werde ich leider diesen Monitorarm von Ergotron zurückschicken.",0

Sadly it is the most expensive. Here is what made a difference to me:1: Stable (other products as well, but this one FEELS stable whereas the others do not)2: Assembly (best in class - including heavy monitor installation)3: Ease of use (best in class - easy to maneuver, easy to move, stays put)4: Aesthetics (bought the aluminum version and it looks really good)5: Quality (this is by far the heaviest, beefiest, well made product in its line)The cons list is short:1: Price (it's expensive, but has from what I can see a best in class warranty offsetting a lot of the inherent cost)2: The set screw ring eats into the back of the post. I wish they would have used a channel or something to help remedy the digging in. This will in time show to my room.3: There is no limiter like the HX (however no others I have used has this to my knowledge)My setup:-----  ------------ -----|  | |  | |  ||2K | |  4K  | | 2K||  | |  | |  |-----  ------------ -----Each of the 2k 27"" monitors use this product.The 43"" 4k monitor uses the Ergotron HX.The 2k left back faces the room. The 4k back faces the corner of my desk. The 2k right is up against a wall.My right monitor is mounted 11"" from the wall with 1/4 gap from the wall to the arm. Math is needed to get it right, so be cautious. The HX has a limiter on the arm.On the cons, I can look past the price as it is a buy once cry once item and a 10 year warranty which means this will definitely outlast my other arms I have in other rooms at a fraction of the cost increase in price over the other items I would trust my expensive monitors to. I have had this monitor setup for 6 years and will likely continue to do so for my workstation. It is PLENTY of space for all my VMs, documents, photo editing, side browser window TV, and communication platform. I expect these arms to last at least 10 years, but if they don't and the warranty does NOT cover something, I will buy another set. I do not expect any of my other monitor arms to last past 3 years.Another item to check out based on my findings: the AVTL is the 2nd heaviest duty mount I found. For non-critical mounting, that is a good mount in my opinion. HOWEVER, I do not know the US presence of the company and do not know how long the mount will last with its 3 year warranty.I am not saying this is the best mount out there but it works for me. I have another room with the AVLT Dual 13""-43"" Mount. I paid less than $190 after tax. The same dual monitor setup here cost almost $650. I do expect to come close to the same cost per year on both items (with the Ergotron edging out slightly at $65 per year vs AVTL $63.33 per year if it lasts the full warranty term). HOWEVER, if you compare apples to apples and do not use a dual monitor mount, now the value is with the Ergotron. The same setup with AVTL as I have on my main workstation (3 single arm mounts) would have cost around $450 after tax whereas the full Ergotron setup set me back $955. Now the cost per year is in the favor of Ergotron for sure as one of my monitors is at the brink of breaking 33lbs (so I did not want to use the almost at limit arm from AVTL where I couldn't find their US presence easily).I hope this helps someone else out there make their decision but I do NOT have any buyers remorse (but I just got them installed today so... YMMV)",0

Moncure,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2012","Whoah. When I first started shopping I could not believe the prices of the LCD swivel mount arms in general. I was prepared to pull out my grandfather's Erector Set and start fabricating my own hack-job of a monitor stand, or go to Home Depot, buy some metal banding, hinges, cinderblock, screws, and some OSB to fabricate my own industrial-style workspace for about 25% of the price of a fancy swivel alone! But after thinking reasonably and logically, I realized that I may as well invest something that suits the aesthetic of others as well as myself. because I don't always work alone. And I don't have an office in my garage. Plus people spend time actually designing and creating items exactly like the Ergotron swivel with form, fit, function (and, it's in the name) ergonomics in miond for a living. I'll lean on others when they are skilled at something I'm not. So here goes my review.Overall, the fit and finish of the components on the Ergotron LX desk mount could not be better for my workspace's design intent. With a brushed and apparently (I say apparently with caution) stainless steel on black look, the product both walks the walk and talks the talk with respect to its rigidity, appearance and construction. That said it is a very heavy item - so take heed - if you got a wobbly desk this thing will make it more wobbly. But that has more to do with  desk selection than the product. The point is this is a product that from what I can see is MOLDED metal and not an extruded piece of [insert expletive here] that was assembled by someone with little to no knowledge of the metal arts.The product itself has various places to loosen the resistive points on the arms, so you can obtain plenty of degrees of freedom (just look at it) when it comes to repositioning. Just be wary of the ceiling if, say, you're placing this in a nook that has a ceiling that slopes down and intercepts the reach of the product - which is what's going on with my current setup.Overall, after about a month of use I am pleased. I can bring the monitor closer to my kids and away from my workspace when they want to watch movies, and I can place it in the most comfortable position require depending on how I orient myself at work.I installed this on a more traditional desk with a rather measly lip on the back. With the included hardware, however, I was able to screw through the desk and pull up with the clamp. In such manner I have sort of haphazardly rigged it to my workspace. However, this was my choice - the better choice would have been to either (1) utilize a desk with an opening for an integrated monitor stand, or (2) utilize a workbench style desk (the latter being the best likely option for me, and probably the best fit for the mount arm).The most SALIENT advice I can offer any consumer of an LCD arm - this one or any other - is to be very careful when pairing it with a monitor. When shopping for monitors at retail,  pay attention to the location of the VESA mount on the display. My monitor's mount is on the bottom of the pedestal that it usually stands upon independently. In order to attach the arm, I had to position the round pedestal vertically, then mount the arm on the base of the pedestal. For that reason, the weak link between the LX Desk Mount Arm and my monitor is my monitor's flimsy hardware. With the mount attached, my display is rather wobbly. Had I PURCHASED A DISPLAY WITH A VESA MOUNT OPPOSITE THE VIEWING SIDE (say. close to the center), I would likely have experienced no wobbliness. But because I didn't consider the physics before buying my display, about 1"" x 1/4"" x 3"" of thermoplastic supports my monitor rather tenuously after the very solid steel arm mounts to the pedestal mount. So make sure your monitor is of the rear-placed VESA mount variety - not of the sort described above.Finally, the integrated cable management system extends all the way until the last vertical arm - but it would be nice if if went, say, 180 degrees or something similar so the cables could be routed under the desk. But overall the product is great - and you will be shocked at the weight and ""meatiness"" of the product compared to others out there for sale on Amazon which I have seen and touched.Don't be afraid to take the plunge even though this item ""seems"" pricey - this is about as near perfect as you're going to get when it comes to a strong, reliable, durable, and well engineered monitor arm. Every time I end up purchasing a relatively expensive item that I've extensively researched, I am reminded that the maxim ""you have to pay for quality"" is still true. And finally - make sure that you have a VESA mount on the rear of your monitor - not on a pedestal base - or be prepared for the wobbles.",-1

M. Peterson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022","TL;DR: want the white version?  Want to mount directly to the desk, without a clamp?  You'll need another part, and that's neither inexpensive nor easy to figure out.First, I'm happy with the arm, basically.  It isn't quite as easy to relocate as I'd hoped, but I've been tinkering with adjustments and I'm getting close to what I want.However, I have a major issue to emphasize, and it's about the depictions of arm and mount in many of the photos.  As an example, look at the primary image of the white arm.  What isn't obvious is how the arm is attached to the surface on which it is mounted.What is shown is the nicest and most professional installation of the system, which is where the base is attached via a ""grommet"" mount; basically a hole is drilled or otherwise reused and you have what is pictured - the arm attached to a base.  However, it is important to know that the white arm does NOT COME WITH THE NECESSARY HARDWARE TO INSTALL IT IN THIS MANNER.  It DOES come with a desk clamp, but the first three images don't show this.  More to the point, the parts necessary for cleanly mounting the arm via a hole in the work surface are much less complicated and ought to be less costly to manufacture and ship than the fairly beefy clamp that is included.The page does, far into the detail section, have this text: ""For White arm model, order separate grommet mount accessory.""  But it's really rather unusual to have the same item packaged differently depending on the color choice; after all there's a color choice option that one might change after already having read through the entire description, and it's easy to miss the fact that ordering a white version actually results in different parts in the box.It also makes, for example, the white version $20-35 more expensive than the polished aluminum.  And - then the question, if you really want the white model, what is the ""separate grommet mount accessory"" that is mentioned?This is an e-commerce site.  Why is there no link to the correct part?  If you go to the Ergotron site, find the part number needed (for the record, it's ‎98-035), type that in the search box - you get two parts that appear to be identical other than the cost, but one is 98-034 - which will NOT fit the base.The arm is nice.  The Ergotron site is complete - but relying on the photos of the white model and ordering without understanding that your only choice is to use a clamp unless you find and order another mounting option is not satisfactory.  Hopefully this might help at least one other buyer.",0

I bought the 8” pole but you should just get the taller pole. It was my fault for getting the shorter pole, but my vesa mounting holes are towards the top half of my monitor so it doesn’t sit high enough for my seating position and size. I reached out to support to try and buy the taller pole but they only sell it as a kit for like $80-100+ which basically replaces the whole stand and not even in solid black.My new project is finding a metal fab near me to make me a new tube because the size is between two standards at Home Depot. Glad they asked me if the pole had threads because I didn’t remember it having any.. it does.. so even if I had to buy an 8 foot pole for two feet I’d still have to find someone to match the threads.I would recommend buying the tall stand and not using all of it instead of buying the shorter one and wishing you had an extra couple inches. It will be future proof and could have the option to add a second monitor if you’d prefer.",-1

Paluda III,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2022","I'm using two of these.  One for an Asus PG279Q and the other for an LG 34GN850 curved ultrawide.  I needed arms that could extend at least 20-25 inches to keep them in a good position while using simming peripherals that push me back almost a foot from the desk.  These definitely have the reach.I went with the permanent install via drilling a hole instead of the clamp type install.  The kit comes with all the hardware you need for this and was easy to swap.  The only tools you need that aren't included are a phillips head screwdriver and a drill.The arms very sturdy and I have no doubt they would hold up to the 25lbs listed in the spec.  If you have a lighter monitor you will likely need to back off the tension all the way.  My Asus is 1 pound over the 7lb minimum, and I had to do this to make it easy to move up and down.The only two things keeping this from a 5 star review are that the cable management for the upper arm piece is pretty bad.  They include two zip ties to just tie the cabled to spots on it.  The bottom arm at the mount base actually has a removable cover though.  The other thing is they are not that easy to push in or pull out horizontally because the arms go together by just sliding onto the base and the upper arm sliding onto the lower arm.There's no bearing, just a plastic sleeve that is split on one side and a set screw with a springy metal piece that gets pushed against the sleeve to add some drag to the rotation.  Also, once you put the arms together with weight on them, that sleeve WILL fall out if you take the arm back off the joint.  Not only that but that springy metal square will go flying out of its slot as it's held in place by the lip of the sleeve.  The sleeve is initially held in place by a bit of double sided clear tape on one edge and that's it.",1

Having had an imac and thunderbolt displays on them for years they have not lost a single gram of tension.  They have never sagged and are rock solid.  One thing i noticed is i went to buy more and amazon has this exact monitor arm under thier basics brand in solid black.  I bought two of those and they are georgeous.Excellent value for the money. I used this arm to mount my 27"" imac late 2011 and two thunderbolt monitors (separate arms for each one).  I hope this helps you if you are considering but worried about weight.  I was but decided to try it out.  Technically the 27"" imac fits the weight requirement barely so I was a little skeptical on stability.  I used the desk mount version to mount the imac (logistics reasons only) and used the wall mount to hang the two 27"" thunderbolt displays to the right and left (again mounting logistics).  It is solid and will work for you so long as you follow the manufacturers guidelines and dont need it to extend more than it is designed ( felt i needed a disclaimer there:)The arm is amazing for its reach flexibilty and positioning.  A few tension adjustments and your monitor just floats perfectly. For the Imac you will want almost max on both height and tilt.  I had some ibm arms that i paid over $300 each for and they did not have nearly the adjustment range.  I ended up getting the extension arm for this mount and it provides almost infinite config options.  I highly recommend it but you need to be careful you dont fully extent because at almost 3 feet out the leverage and weight become sketchy.  I use the extension just as an articulation point to get a couple extra inches so it rests almost on top of the original kit.The arm is brilliant in terms of design because its super simple to adjust tensions so they work.  Its also A great value for the money.  It gets even a 27"" imac where you need it floating above your desk.  I bought three of these for the price of one of the ibm mounts granted this was 3 years ago.My only issue is with the finish on the metal.  If you are going to highlight silver make sure its clean and not marked up when you ship.  When I opened the item I noticed a bunch of marks on the shiny silver pieces of the arm.  Not a deal breaker but a bummer when you get a new item.  It should look like new right?  That said the arms are behind the monitors and I dont really care what they look like because they are doing the job. so thats why the get a 4.5 stars.  If i was buying for looks and not function this would get a 2 star rating. I would actually just prefer an all black arm so they dont stand out and it would eliminate the issues on the finish.",1

However, I only gave it 4 stars because there was no out-of-the-box solution provided to keep the arms from hitting the wall (see Cons below). I was also unable to find an add-on solution offered by Ergotron (if someone knows of one, please leave a comment with the details).Pros:- Looks good.- Stays where you set it.- Good price for the quality.- Tension adjustments for all articulations (except 360 screen rotation and pan).- Easy to assemble (helpful step-by-step assembly video is available on the Ergotron website).Cons:Note - If you don't have an issue with the arm protruding beyond the back of the desk, neither item listed below should be an issue for you (so it's safe to disregard both).- No 180 degree rotation stop option - If your desk backs to a wall that you don't want marked/dented by the arm repeatedly hitting it when you put the monitor in its fully retracted position (or if you just don't want the arm protruding beyond the back of your desk for whatever reason), this product falls short. For my application, the arm would be greatly improved if Ergotron had engineered a solution for this common issue. After giving it some thought, I was able to come up with a very simple way to keep the arm from damaging my wall by placing 3/4"" adhesive vinyl bumpers on the ends of the upper and lower arms (see pics). Now the soft bumper contacts the wall rather than the metal arm. I also added another bumper to the upper arm where it comes into contact with the ""Tall Pole"" when the monitor is put in a low position and then retracted (see pics).- No pan tension adjustment - It appears this product intends the pan motion to be accomplished primarily via the tension-adjustable joints in lower arm rather than the non-adjustable pan joint nearest the monitor. There's no issue when the arm is mostly extended because the lower arm does not contact the wall while panning. However, when the arm is retracted, the (very stiff) pan joint nearest the monitor will not move before the joint in the lower arm does. So when panning in the retracted position, the lower arm uses the wall as a leverage point. In the absence of a mechanical rotation stop, it would be nice to be able to adjust the tension in the upper pan joint so that it would move there more easily (instead of all the movement taking place in the lower arm).Also, if it hasn't already occurred to you, it's probably a good idea to take some measurements to be sure your current monitor cable will be long enough. Because of the extra length this arm adds when extended, you may want to consider buying a longer monitor cable at the same time you buy the arm. Standard monitor cables are about 5-6' and unless your monitor is very close to your machine, a standard cable might be too short.If I haven't added an update to the top of this review, this product is still working out great for me.",1

Gamut,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2012","I really like the quality of these Ergotron arms. They are less expensive than those by Humanscale, they offer more add-on options, and they look great. The packaging was perfect and they provide enough hardware to bolt-mount or clamp the arms, even providing extra screws. The instructions were above average compared to what we usually get with hardware and other equipment these days.I am giving these four instead of five only because they are still not tall enough, even being the tall version of these poles. I have a console desk (you know, the ones that have a monitor riser built-in) and I used these to expand it to accommodate both standing and sitting work situations. The height of the console desk is a standard 40 inches and these arms/posts are just three inches shy of putting the monitors where a six-foot person needs them to be when standing and with the arms extended to maximum height, positioned at the top of the poles, and with all four mounting points bolted. I wound up inserting an inch-thick board on top of the surface where the clamp attaches (the surface is glass anyhow, bottom of the clamp gripping the metal chassis) and I bolted the top edge of the mounting bracket to the bottom two holes on the monitors as a quick fix. This works for now when I adjust the height from the arm and *not* the monitor, but I am still going to need to add some more metal reinforcement so that someone unaware of this doesn't break the monitor's plastic backing. I am not comfortable with only two of the four mount points being used anyhow. I also wish that the clamp could have been extended an additional inch but I doubt that Ergotron's engineers predicted that their monitor arms would be used for this type of solution. (hey guys, if you're reading this, here is a cool way to use your product and you're oh-so-close to being ready for this, out of the box!)Although I could have just gotten a single arm with the dual-monitor version, I got two of these to mount each of my two monitors independently and from the opposing left and right edges of my desktop.",1

Well made, does not feel cheap at all and I can trust it with my expensive monitor. It's nice having the monitor at a comfortable height and distance.I used the clamp desk mount option and did not drill any holes. It was not clear if the desk mount would leave any permanent marks on the desk surface, so I used a very thin cardboard spacer just in case.I gave it a 4/5 rating because the directions are image-based, no written words so they can be used internationally. The drawback is that they are cryptic and lack depth, so it took a while to figure out how to fix the height so no movement occurred. Also, what little print there is, is very small, just like all the instructions for many other products - I guess they don't use people over 40 in testing. However, there are several videos posted that are very helpful, so if the directions don't get you up an running in 5 minutes, check them out.",1

For a long time I had my 24"" Dell LCD on the top shelf and my midi keyboard on the second shelf.  I could push the midi keyboard back and work on the bottom shelf.  Was great for working and music recording.  However, as I get older I found myself having to tilt my head to get the mid and/or reading part of my glasses to see the monitor.  I tried computer glasses, but they didn't seem to work, and seeing as they would have to constantly be replaced, I was looking for another solution.  I put the monitor on the lower shelf and that helped, but it took away my workspace and I had to lift it up when I needed my midi keyboard.  So I looked for a desk arm and decided on this one.  I have it mounted on the back of the top shelf and it reaches over the top shelf and the monitor is about 2"" from the bottom desk.  I can move it out of the way when I need to record work.  I will try to get a video review up showing how I am using the monitor.Anyway, I couldn't find any info on my monitor, so I estimated the weight (Lazy, didn't disconnect it and weigh it).  I would say the Dell is a little over 10lbs, so the arm won't always keep it in position.  However, I find this a minor issue,  In my daily hover over the desktop, I'm at an equilibrium point and the monitor sits a few inches off the bottom desk.  If I need to put it up, and can rest it on the top shelf.I am entertaining the idea of getting windows 8.  If I do I will be getting a touch monitor and the 2 arm LCD mount.  I am happy very happy with the construction and quality of this mount and will buy from this company again.Feel free to ask any questions on my setup.CheersJim",0

Its always a little nerve racking mounting a very expensive cintiq (I have the 22hd) on anything other than what was built specifically to hold it. In the end, however, I forget that I ever used anything else. It feels extremely natural to pull the screen down to your lap and work on it at any angle you feel like. I was amazed to find that it held my desired angle even when I was drawing on it (which is the whole point of course).There were two disappointments that I had with the device. The first is that the instructions came somewhat shredded. Almost in a comical fashion. I basically have the outside borders and the middle has been ripped out. Its not floating around in the box somewhere either. Its just gone. Now, this isn't a particularly complicated device and moreover the directions can probably be found online somewhere, it was just annoying. The second problem I'm having is that it wont keep the monitor more than about two inches off the desk. This cintiq is heavy, almost at the limit, but it seems like it should hold to a place I move it. That said, I dont ever have to raise it and it holds extremely well in all the drawing positions I use, which are usually pulled forward into my lap, so its not even a big enough deal for me to search online and see if the fix is somewhere in the missing chunk of instructions.If you use a 22hd with the stock stand, you need this in your life. It feels so much more natural, like the way a cintiq is meant to be experienced. I get full 360 degree rotation at any angle I like, and for that reason alone I can't imagine going back to the stock stand.PS. my setup actually has the arm attached to the table on the right side of my desk instead of the back of the desk. It works just fine. I'll upload some pictures as well.",0

I turned the tension screw all the way clockwise, counterclockwise and in many positions in between. I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out and if there was a solution online. The box did have an extra strip of moving tape on it, nothing like manufacturers use. I think I got the previous reviewer's return!UPDATE (4 stars): After almost ordering the Amazon brand to replace this one, I read from a review of the Amazon arm that it is a rebranded Ergotron.  Also, one of the reviewers wrote a tip to give it a lot of force, if it seems stuck.  I was already applying so much force, I thought I'd break it.  I also found the manual for a different Ergotron model that actually said to turn the screw ""counterclockwise"" loosen the joint.  The manual for this LX model has drawings of arrows, which look like the opposite direction is true.  So after playing with it some more, it began to budge.  I really had to use some strength, but then it gets a little smoother after that.  It never gets to the point where the joints feel light like it does in the instructional videos when it bends by the weight of the monitor.  Maybe mine happened to be a really tight one.",1

I confirmed on the Ergotron website that the arm was able to support my monitor (Please make sure you verify which Ergotron arm supports your monitor -- it does make a difference!)[...]Do not just look at the weight capacities of the arm, the thickness of the monitor also impacts how much weight the arm can hold because the thickness shifts the center of gravity.It comes very well packaged and when you first look at it, it is very impressive.  It is heavy and just a beautiful piece of engineering.  The assembly instructions are actually very easy, the pictogram they provide is unnecessarily convoluted and would be greatly enhanced with just some written words.  There is an online video on their site that does a good job explaining how to assemble and use the arm.I used the edge-clamp assembly and it is very sturdy and not intrusive at all on my desk.  I can not imagine this ever coming unstable; it feels now part of my desk.There are few things I would have liked to see better executed on for the arm:1. After assembly the arm kept on falling down and was unable to support my monitor.  I called their customer support and he walked me through a how to tighten the arm-tensioner with a hex-key provided with the arm.  I would have preferred it was tensioned in the factory better, but also there is no mention of this tensioner in the manual provided.  I would have never found it myself without calling their customer-support.  BTW, their customer support was excellent.2. The cable-tray built into the lower-arm is too small; it can barely hold the wires to my monitor.  Also the ""cable-ties"" on the upper seem like a last minute-hack.  You spend all this time and effort designing this beautiful arm and it is somewhat ruined by the cables being hung from the upper-arm with zip-ties.I would definitely but it again.",1

Once I applied the proper amount of tension it held the Cintiq like a champ and I can now position the display in more useful positions for drawing and clear more space on my desk if need be. The arm is high quality, solid metal. Feels very sturdy and looks sleek. The wire containment also worked well for the Cintiq's thick cable.The only negative I can give the arm is that the mounting options aren't flexible enough. If it's physically possible (and it may not be) it would be nice if the clamp could work up to 3.5 inches for thicker desks. Also, it would be nice if they included multiple carriage bolts with different lengths. I had to drill a hole into my desk that led to a drawer and the included carriage bolt was simply too long and stopped the drawer from opening, so I went out and purchased a shorter carriage bolt and that did the trick. It would be nice if maybe they offered accessories like this on their site (or suggestions).Overall, for the price, this is a great solution for mounting a Cintiq and getting that beast into a good, natural position for drawing. Only time will tell if the arm maintains its level of sturdiness.",1

I addition to internet searches, I checked several similar products at Frys, Staples, & Office Depot. All of these I found to be  overpriced and/or functionally inadequate or inferior to this product.  At this point in time, this product seems to offer the best price/feature ratio.After doing the research, I decided to try the Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm 45-241-026. I've been using this device for one week now.  I would recommend it.  Here's why:PROS:1. Relatively fast/easy to install out of the box.2. All key components are die cast or stamped metal.  Only the two trim caps and the cable tray on the back arm section are plastic.3. Provides up to 24"" extension from the base.4. Functions very smoothly, allows for monitor placement in any position.5. Seems durable. I would expect an above-average service life for this product.6. VESA mount compatible (400 mm/4 hole).7. Well designed and engineered, with a sleek ""hi-tech"" appearance.8. Includes parts for either ""clamp on"" or ""through desk top"" mounting. I used the ""through desk top"" for maximum reach and the mounting is very solid.CONS:1. A bit pricey, but probably worth it if it lasts as long as I expect it to.2. The cable management on the ""forearm"" consists of 2 tie wraps. A simple snap-in plastic tray (like the back arm) would look much better and only add a few pennies to the production unit cost. However, this is a minor point.3. There is a slight, momentary LCD wobble when the arm/monitor is repositioned, but again this is a minor point.After combining this monitor arm with a good slide out keyboard tray, a good workstation chair, and an ergonomic mouse, I'm much more comfortable at my computer.",1

I use more than 1 of these.So they are worth while. However they aren't as flexible in their use as one might think.Or at least I expected more from them than they provide.It's plagued a little I think by some lack of imagination in the design.Part of which makes the tall pole more useful.Some things that are not so obvious about any of this type of arm:1) the really high position it seems to be holding the picture is really at about the same height as the monitor would be on it's own stand.2) That's almost as high it will let you raise it using just the arm motion3) it won't let you face the monitor downward much. At most maybe 10 or 15 degrees. So you can't set this up next to a low seat or a bed and then position it so you're looking up at it.4) the monitors are rigidly in place. it you bump or tap them, they will jiggle and bounce.The tall pole version at least allows you to start it at a high level than normal so you sort of get to raise the monitor above the height your stand would have allowed.But the pole still doesn't allow the monitor to face down.So overall nice to have but a bit of a let down because they seem like the should have more degrees freedom in their movement than they actually do.",1

First 3x Dell U2415 on a horizontal only 3 screen mount. Then 1x U2415 and a U3415W on a 2 screen horizontal only mount. Now due to some neck and back strain that I am trying to alleviate, I've moved the U3415W to this Ergotron.It assembled easily. I opted for the 13"" over the 8"" pole, to maximize available height. And it's good that I did, since my widescreen is now only just slightly above eye level with my preferred chair and arm position.I figured this would wobble quite a bit -- but was pleasantly surprised that it doesn't as much as I thought. And, like I saw somewhere on the product page, it does hold my 35 lbs widescreen, after tensioning the raise arm appropriately.My only complaint is that that 13"" pole version is a whopping $60 more than the 8"".",1

I didn't purchase the extension, but I liked having the option if the mounting didn't work out right.It was easy to install on my desk, and when tightened down the base becomes very solid.  The arms installed easily, and it was equally easy to connect my LCD panel with the included thumbscrews.  Hand tighten the thumbscrews, but be careful not to over tighten.  I over tightened one of the thumbscrews and it became a little deformed. Not a big deal, and is still works fine.The one place where this arm loses a star is in the system for concealing cabling.  The lower arm is great, with the wiring running inside of a channel with a cover that you can snap on or off.  The upper arm is another matter entirely.  It also has a channel for the wiring, but instead of using a removable cover, they put a hook on each end of the arm and the only way to secure the wiring is with a pair of zip-ties.  Really bad design, since if you ever want to change something you have to cut both zip ties, something which isn't really easy, and replace them afterward.By the way, there are two versions of this, a short pole version and a tall pole version.",1

McGowan,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2011","The instructions aren't the best, but the product is fine.  You'll figure out the installation just fine; take your time and hold the parts in your hands to visualize proper assembly.  However, do read the instructions and heed the warning about removing certain screws!For mounting ASUS 24-inch LCD monitors, the factory tension settings worked fine.  Tighten clamp to desk, install first arm, screw second arm to appropriate holes on monitor (the ASUS had VESA mounting holes) and then slip the two arms together.  Attaching power and signal cables to the arms is the final step.I bought two of these and clamped one to my wife's old-style wooden desk and one to my converted drafting table.  Both installed without the need for any additional spacers or force-spreading devices (think wood or metal block to expand the footprint of the clamp plate).The desk sits about ¾-inch away from a wall.  Moving that heavy wooden desk to reach the knob for tightening clamp was not appealing, so I made a tool from 2-inch schedule 40 PVC pipe.  Just trace the clamp fingers onto one end of the pipe and saw out the waste with a hacksaw (about ½-inch deep or so).  Space the fingers so they fit snuggly on the clamp, so the tool doesn't slip off while you are reaching in from the bottom middle front-side of the desk.  Clamp tightened fine, and all is well.  I left the tool in place behind desk, so I could find it, should the need arise to remove or adjust clamp.",1

Sturdy enough. I wish I got the HX arm as it wobbles a bit when I type on my standing desk, but admittedly, I SLAM my fingers when typing. Should be more than OK for most cases. Only thing that really bothered me was the assembly. I stripped the allen bolt that is used for the stop/height adjustment on the rod, and its stuck too high up on the rod to fit the middle arm attachment and the screen arm attachment, so I had to skip out on the middle arm for now. Will need to use special tools to remove that bolt, and then find the same bolt elsewhere since it didn't come with extras.

The Ergotron LX Desk Mount (45-241-026) handles the 34"" Ultra Wide 34UM95 with ease. I just completed installing the mount on my desk. You have to adjust the Lift arm quite a bit from the factory setting to get the monitor to float properly, but once you have it dialed in it handles it perfectly fine. This is the weight capacity according to the manufacturer's site:""* Weight Capacity: 5 to 25 lbs (2.3 to 11.3 kg). With monitors greater than 20 lbs (9.1 kg) in weight, the vertical range of motion may be reduced up to 4.5"" (11 cm) for a total height range of 8.5"" (22 cm)""Wish the Tilt adjustment had a looser adjustment. With the tilt adjuster fully loosened, the adjustment itself still feels pretty stiff.I took off one star because both supplied M4 x 10 VESA mounting screws were too long for the display.

So minus a star for that. Thankfully, my buddy had his own set and I got everything adjusted. Everything had already been assembled and I just needed to screw it into my monitor and stack each arm on their respective poles, but I dont think it comes this way new. It's quite difficult to lift my monitor (which is within the supported capacity) up even after adjusting tension but is easier to pull down, I assume this is just due to its weight.Overall works great and this brand definitely lives up to its highly regarded reputation.

I am able to adjust the screen to be at the perfect angle and height with little effort at all. When in place, it remains until physically adjusted.I did have an issue with my desk's lip being too much for the clamp (A secretary style desk with a larger lip on the back - or rather front, for those walking into the office). The included bracket didn't extend far enough around the lip and still have enough screw to keep it tight. The lip is about 2.5"" tall, and 1.5"" deep.My solution was to take a 1""X6"" board to place out of sight under the lip, so the screw had something to tighten onto. This has worked just fine.In reality, the screw is hardly needed since the weight of the base sitting on the desk is enough to keep the monitor stable. But, if you're like me and want things secure, it works.The only other limitation I feel the arm has is the cable management. It is kind of an awkward set up to have zip ties on one part of the arm and a nice tuck space on the other.",1

The arm is very sturdy and solid.  I was prepared to mount it onto my Ikea work table by drilling and using the supplied hardware, but the clamp mounting is more than adequate to hold the arm and monitor.  The primary reason for the Ergotron arm is to move the monitor for viewing while working out on exercise equipment in the room.  The monitor has a hookup to a desktop computer as well as an HD switcher for DirecTV or PlayStation 3, so there are four cables running from the back of the monitor and I attached them to the arm with a tie.  It is not a real space saver for the desktop, since there must be available room for the arm to swing into place when moved, but this wasn't a concern for my setup.  The installation was pretty easy and intuitive, with the only challenge posed by finding the adjustment screw for keeping a heavy monitor in place.  My keyboard is setup on a desktop separate from the mounted table, so there isn't any shaking of the monitor, but slight monitor movement could be a concern if the mounted table wasn't solid and heavy.  I'd recommend the arm for most uses.",1

The instructions consist of a detailed diagram, but it was relatively easy to figure out. The mount fit my monitor, and the screws were the right diameter, but too long--they could not be screwed in all the way, and the monitor wobbled. I solved the problem by placing rubber faucet washers around the screws, between the mounting plate and the monitor back. I had them on hand, so it wasn't a big deal, but I think washers should be included for just such situations.The joints have just the right amount of ""stiffness"" to be easy enough to move when you want to, but stay strongly in position  My one quibble is that to change the height you need to unscrew the retaining band using the tiny allen wrench that was included. The screw is probably necessary for stability, but they should have made it a thumbscrew so we don't have to fish out the wrench all the time (and it's probably going to get lost eventually anyway).Overall, this is an excellent product that I am glad I purchased.",1

I have had it for several months now, and overall I am very pleased with the purchase. I initially bought it to add some height to my monitor and I liked the idea of being able to position it however I want. I have a 24 inch Dell monitor connected to it and it works great. However, I would echo prior reviewers in that the pole is a little short and the range of motion is a little less than what I had imagined. It seems to me that if they could lengthen it to allow users the option of more height for their monitor if they desire. It would be nice if they had some sort of rotation stop that would allow you to click your monitor in to perfectly horizontal and vertical positions, but that is not a big deal. I have noticed some shaking if I bump the desk, but it is not bad and generally the monitor sits solidly. The cable management ties are a joke because I screwed up on my first attempt. A dollar at Lowes for a pack of these solved the problem nicely.  Overall, I would buy again because it works, looks great, and has given me back my desk space.",1

Just remove the clamp and screw it right to the wall.  I used all 6 holes with 3"" lags.  There is a small amount of flex when using it this way due to all the weight not being transferred to a desktop.  The L bracket is fairly thick and shows no signs of bending after months of use.  The arms have adjustments for controlling the amount of force it takes to move each section.  Tons of flexibility.  I move it 180 degrees daily depending on whether or not the LCD is being used as a TV or as a monitor.  Definitely a well made solid product.  Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack-luster wiring management.  I used spiral wrap around the wires I ran to my LCD (DVI, component, RG6, audio, power) which looks ok.",1

The ability to bring the monitor off the table edge and into my lap is extremely satisfying for sketching with normal posture.  The quality of the build and ease of setup is superb; I've had no problems and no complaints.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because you have to tweak the tension of keeping the monitor up (meaning, the arm will prevent the monitor from sagging).  This tweak has to be balanced with the ease of mobility.  What this ultimately means is: the monitor will hold its position... but if you pull it out too far and don't rest part of the monitor on a desk, the monitor will ""bounce"" while sketching.  Think about it... you've got this 30lb. monitor hanging out on an arm with no support... yeah, it'll bounce.  Once you figure out how to stop this by resting the monitor on the desk in your desired position... it's no prob!  That's just physics.",1

While it moves easily and you can tilt the Cintiq no problem, it still seems too heavy for the arm. I have to make sure it stays rested on my desk surface other wise it slowly droops down, and for some reason it wants to tilt to the (your) left if unsupported (yes I have tightened the thing almost to breaking as well).

The monitors do not allow for the bracket (a 4 hole bracket) to be mounted on the center, so the mount is slightly to the side. This wouldn't be a problem except the screw to prevent the screen from rotating doesn't fit snuggly and allows about 1 degree of rotation. This was fixed by adding a bit of wire around the screw. Once that was rigged up, I have spent several days trying to find the exact right tension for the set screws to allow me to still move the monitors, but have the monitors not slowly droop. At this point I have it so that I don't notice the droop in real time, but the next day the monitor isn't where I left it.Gravity does always win. And I'm sure there is a way to get just the right tension, but so far I've always found too tight or too loose.",0

The included printed instructions were ambiguous, and I finally went to the manufacturer's website to view a video of someone assembling the arm. This quickly cleared up my confusion, and the arm then went together nicely.The arm comes with two sets of mounting hardware, one for through-hole desktop mounting and the other for mounting on the desk edge.

Since I wanted to put a 27"" monitor on it, I wanted to make sure I found one that was strong and well made. This one certainly does the job! As others have noted, the one complaint I have is that the mounting post isn't very tall, and since the joints don't move upward very far, the highest I can raise the 27"" monitor is about 5"" above the desk. If I could raise it just 3 or 4 more inches, that would have been great, but all things considered it's just a minor detail. It's strong and stays where you put it. The attachment to the monitor itself is a multi-axis swivel, so you can tilt and rotate the monitor in whichever direction you need to.",1

It just wasn't made quite that well, and did not have the positioning abilities that I wanted, plus it wasn't tall enough for my standing desk. This arm is much, much better - it's very well made and holds my monitor very securely. It's also very easy to move the monitor to just about any position I want with very little effort. So it works for my stand up/sit down workstation, which is just what I needed. Why four stars? Because I am 5'2"" tall and this are does not have the height I was looking for. Unless there's an adjustment that I don't know about, maybe. From what I've seen, it looks like the top arm is at its highest position just like in the picture on Amazon. I can get the monitor to go down, but no further up. It's impossible to tell from the very scanty instructions which joints are repositionable and which aren't, so maybe I just don't know how to get it to go higher.  And I also may be too picky, but I want my monitor at eye height so I don't have to look down at all, I want to be able to look straight ahead and have my information straight in front of me.  This arm is about 3"" too short of that. So I have the extension arm on order, and am hoping that will give me the extra couple of inches I want for this arm to be perfect for me. However, this is just a personal preference. Other than that, this is a great piece of equipment, it looks like it's built to last forever!!!! Easy to install, too, even with the crappy instructions. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to be able to reposition a computer monitor regularly, especially if you're in a stand up/sit down workstation like I am. This arm is just perfect for that, with the exception of the height problem. And that may not be a problem for anyone else. If anyone out there knows how to adjust that top arm to go higher than the approximately 45 degree angle it's at please let me know!  Overall, very well worth the money and I'm glad I shelled out the extra bucks to move up to this arm from the one I had.Update: I received the extension piece for this monitor arm that is sold here on Amazon. It's basically the same piece as the part that attaches to the pole. It took all of a minute to install and re-position my wiring, and the height problem was solved! Now my monitor is at eye height, which is exactly what I was trying to get accomplished. So now this is a five star review! If you're interested in the extension arm, it's the Ergotron 45-289-026 Mounting Extension. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but it solved my very irritating problem, so it was well worth the money. My workstation is now set up exactly the way I want it, with no eye, neck, or back strain from bending over just a little to get closer to my monitor screen.

It is beautifully designed and made.  It is quite heavy & sturdy.  The design is superb.  The parts are all made of heavy duty steel and bolted together with fine screws.  There are 2 Allen wrenches for adjustments.  I used the through table mount but there is also a C-clamp mount.  It can be used with 1 or 2 arms depending on your needs and size of the space.  I used 1 arm.  The instructions that came with it were detailed and excellent.  I had no trouble assembling and installing it.  There are also on-line instructions and several videos at the website of the manufacturer.  It is fairly expensive for a mounting, but it is a pleasure to have and use.  I expect it will last a lifetime.As the instructions note, it is difficult or impossible to move it well until the VESA plate is screwed onto the monitor.  After that, it is readily moved.  The Allen screws and be adjusted to more or less tightness.",2

The cheaper ones are no more than clugs with badly fitting parts and whose screws need to be loosened, if they haven't been stripped, if you want to move the monitor position. In its price range and above I haven't yet found a decent competitor except for the Humanscale M2 or M8. The LX is a well made, nicely designed, unit well worth the price.At first, it wouldn't hold my monitor up -- the upper arm kept sinking -- and yet my monitor, at 15.4 lbs., was well below the 20 lb. max capacity for this unit. The adjustment for the weight of the monitor is #2 on the scant pictographic instructions. The picture instructions are not the best--not the worst but. . . Anyway I searched for an adjustment to the spring-tension canister in the upper arm that counterbalances the monitor's weight. Pushing the upper arm up and the screen mount down reveals the adjustment screw head at the end of the canister and the larger supplied wrench fits it. 3 half-turns clockwise made no diff. So I added three more half-turns; better but still slowly sinking. I added a 3 more half-turns--much better. 3 more for a total of 12 half-turns and the balance was perfect. You need to ease your way up to the right number of turns to get it just right balance and to avoid overtightening. Once adjusted correctly, the montoro stays in palce but can be moved easily up and down.What's nice about this unit is that, once you have it set up, you can move the monitor around and up and down without readjusting the tension or loosening/retigthening any screws. Although, if your desk is on casters or wheels, you will want to lock them, which is a good safety rule anyway. The elevation movement is smooth and easy--you can move it up or down with one finger. The horizontal swing movement is much stiffer. It helps if you spray the two large post joints with silicone lubricant liberally and then wipe away thoroughly all of the excess. This won't make the swing movement light, but it does ease it up a bit. By post joints I mean the large joints where the upper arm meets the lower and were the lower arm meets the desk mounting post. These joints have no bearings; they have plastic sleeve-type bushings. Compared to the Humanscale: the Humanscale moves horizontally as easily as the LX moves vertically while the Humanscale moves vertically as stiffly as the LX moves horizonstally--either way I'm not sure the difference is worth the extra money for the Humanscale. This stiff horizontal movement is less than ideal but far better than what I've seen on some of the cheaper units offer. For this price I could live with stiffness given all the other postive features.The LX comes with a heavy duty clamp base and a drill-a-hole-in-the-desk grommet type mount--both come in the box. All of the parts are in a two-layer plastic strip, sealed into multiple compartments with each compartment labeled as to contents. Much better than those units that come with all the screws etc. all in one bag and you have to sort them by count and looks against their picture in the instructions.It's not quite as pretty as the Humanscale M2 or M8, which cost about 60% more, but much more nicely finished than the cheaper units I've seen up close. The LX, with less attractive desk mounting pole, has a greater range of vertical position than the Humanscale.If you can afford it, this monitor arm is a very good choice. If you can afford more, then it's a tough choice between this at its price vs the Humanscale arms at the higher prices. For the money, this is a much better deal, thus, my rating of 5 stars.",2

This arm is expensive, but honestly for something you can keep using its worth the premium.  I always thought a monitor arm is a monitor arm but this product changed my perception of that.This arm has very smooth motion, very easy to move it around and dial in the right setting you need for the situation. Once you got it positioned it is extremely sturdy and stays where you set it.  You can continually adjust this thing with ease, no need to mess with tension screws or jank actions.It looks slick in matte black, which is a lot nicer than the plastic or shiny materials used in other mounts.  Not really a big deal but its sometimes the small details.Installation was easier than any other arm i've installed. The parts are laid out properly and the way it goes together in parts is a lot more smooth than other designs.  Its pretty much 3 lego pieces and you're done, the base is just a base so its not top heavy while you're trying to secure it to your desk.  Monitor cant be nut locked in place so you have to remove the entire last segment to replace your screen, but that adds to the stability of the monitor as it doesn't shake at all.Having a screw to disable rotation is great for my OCD tendencies, you can get very slight rotation but getting it fully strait takes zero effort, no need for rulers.",1

It's very solidly built, fairly well thought out, and once set up it adjusts easily.  When I unpacked, I was surprised at how heavy it was -- it is really solid.  There are a couple of small caveats but they aren't enough to diminish my rating.First, the adjustment for the counter-spring for the vertical movement is next to impossible.  The design calls for inserting an Allen wrench into the area behind the joint where the monitor mounting plate is attached to engage the rod which controls the spring tension.  First, it is pointless to try the adjustment without the monitor in place since it is the monitor's weight one is attempting to counterbalance, and that means that the monitor will make it impossible to see into the recessed area where the wrench needs to go.  There is nothing in there to guide the wrench so it is practically impossible to fit it into the hex-head on the end of the rod.  Meanwhile, with the monitor and other parts of the arm in the way one cannot just continually turn the wrench -- one must turn it, then remove it and reorient it before inserting it again -- so even getting lucky at getting the wrench seated the first time won't help much.  Lucky for me that the factory setting was almost perfect for my monitor so I didn't have to monkey with this that much.  It is a bad design and I hope they are smart enough to change it for future offerings.My second caveat is really minor, but it just seems like they could have easily handled it better.  One installation option involves installing the arm on a surface by running a bolt in the platform of the arm through a hole in the table's surface and then using a wingnut to clamp a small plate underneath the mounting surface.  This works well but the bolt is very long -- I'm not sure why they need a bolt that long.  In my case, there was a drawer beneath the surface where I was mounting it and the excess length of the bolt interfered with the drawer.  One option to fix this is to use a shorter bolt -- that might not be easy to do, however.Where the bolt fits through the platform of the arm, it drops into a square hole and the bolt has a square section at the top of its shaft which locks into that square hole to keep the bolt from turning.  It might not be that easy to find a replacement bolt with that square section as I suspect that it is not a standard part.  Another option is to take a hack saw and cut off the excess portion of the bolt.  Unless there is sufficient room in the mounting area to accommodate a hack saw, this would entail mounting the arm, marking the place to cut the bolt and then removing the arm to retrieve the bolt (and one would likely need a vise to hold the bolt while cutting).  It would have been easy to avoid all of this, however.  The bolt itself is at the bottom of the hollow upright tube which the arm is mounted on -- if they had just welded a nut to the platform and threaded the bolt through a lock-nut, then the welded nut, it could be adjusted to whatever height was desired before installing.  To avoid having to install, mark the bolt, and then remove for adjustment, one could likely just estimate the length needed based on the surface on which it is to be mounted (to be fair, one could do the same with the hacksaw method but with the downside of needing to obtain a new bolt if the estimated length turned out to be too short).One last complaint involves the provisions for cable control -- the cavity in the arm for passing the cables is a little awkward to use and seems a bit small.  It works well enough, however -- the real problem is that there is nothing similar for the upper arm and since a little slack is needed in the cables to allow for moving the monitor around, angling the screen, etc., one is faced with having cables drooping down behind the monitor.  I alleviated this a bit by using some velcro ties to hold the cables to the upper arm so that the slack portion is only from the end of the arm to the monitor.These are minor quibbles, however, and only affect the setup.  Once the arm is in place and adjusted, it works great, easily holds my 22 inch monitor, and I am very happy with it.",1

Here are some of the standouts :- It's precision engineered and solid- It's sexy looking- It's American made  (any company that is hiring people HERE to make innovative and quality products gets a *big salute and a bonus)- It's adjustable to almost any angle you could possibly make use of,  and- When you maneuver it to the spot you want - it STAYS- But when you want to quickly move or simply adjust it to another spot,  it smoothly swivels there .. and STAYS- And all of this even with heavy monitors - like my Dell 23"" touchscreen.For work I put the arm attached to the back of the desk behind my laptop, and the DELL hangs nice and solid above the laptop screen for a perfect dual screen setup.  At my height (6'3"") that puts the big monitor right at eye height.  Perfect for design and development.I push the laptop to the side and swing the arm all the way down to desk height in front of me for DJ'ing with the touchscreen.  And I easily swing the arm with the DELL all the way around facing my bed if I feel like watching a movie at night.At no time have I doubted that this thing was stable or that my heavy monitor was in any way at risk.  Nor is it the slightest bit finicky about moving or staying where I put it.  It smoothly and precisely does its job and does not need adjustment at the joints in the slightest.Now about my experience with customer service:The assembly is basically simple,  so the 1 or 2 page sparse instructions were good enough for me to get it 90% there.  However the last thing that was holding me up mounting it and finishing the job,  was the 'pan' motion left and right (like shaking your head motion left right).All of the other directions of motion have either hex bolts for adjustment,  or a screw,  or they don't need any adjustment.  But the pan left/right was stuck.  And I couldn't find any adjustment for that axis of motion at all.When I called the company on the phone somebody picked up after minimal hold.  Lo and behold if it wasn't someone living and working right here in the US!  After I briefly explained the problem she said she had never seen that before,  and she took my number to have someone call me back as soon as they got in the office.Well the next morning I got a call from someone who immediately and helpfully fixed the issue.  He said that axis of motion did not need an adjustment.  I grabbed a can of spray silicone and a couple of shots on the axis bolt and it was working great.I had a feeling this guy was in management at the company or possibly the owner.  He was really friendly and concerned that the unit was working out as advertised - he was also intimately acquainted with the engineering of the arm.Anyway, I purchased some great products in 2013,  but this desk mount arm is my personal Product of the Year.  In fact,  I like it so much that I just ordered one of their laptop stands.  With the quality of the arm I already own in mind I'm sure its just as precision and solidly built.",1

It took me over an hour to get the cheaper ones setup, also I could never quite get them at the right height + depth + tilt all at the same time.With these it takes a few minutes tops to setup and you can place them in pretty much any position as long as you leave 1-3 inches of space behind your desk. Definitely recommend them if you can afford them but the budget ones will get you by. Generally I think this is a product you buy once.One recommendation I would make is for dual monitors getting two separate poles for more customizability. It's a bit more expensive but I've found sharing a pole can limit the range of motion if you have two large monitors.",1

I've never used the included stand that came with my cintiq, and nor would I care to. The ergotron does everything a person could about want, better, faster, and easier. I can recline in my chair and pull the Cintiq into my lap, tilt it back and lay a picture book on 1 half of the screen *to ref draw from it*, or rotate my screen to stand vertical giving me a humongous tall drawing area, or even lifting the stand to put my screen up high so I can stand while drawing if I am in the mood for such, or move the screen to face any-which way in my living room as I see fit.A good arm mount like this just isn't for Cintiqs, everyone should have one of these who doesn't have a huge screen display! I can easily pull the screen down right into my face for reading small text in high res, move it up and tilt it to face downwards at me while reclining back in extreme comfort while gaming or watching movies, and easily push it back when I need to get up.  For drawing this thing is awesome. Being able to pull my screen right into my face is so handy for drawing as I look to study small details., but it's equally impressive for entertainment use. I at all times can have the screen exactly where I want and even positions I never even considered. Should people have this much power I wonder.? Are we ready as a society?The various sections of the arm are adjustable with the included tools, to make it as loose or as tight as you'd want. I did have to adjust the tension of each piece a little bit. Some were too tight, others too loose. Again this was easy to do, just follow the instructions and look at the diagrams carefully. I have seen no evidence of sagging or weakening, it's just as stiff as the day I got it, and even if it did start to loosen up, I can tighten the tension screws more. I have it tight enough that I don't move the screen while pushing the stylus pen on it, and yet loose enough that it takes very little muscle to put it into any position I want. Moving it or rotating to aid in drawing is so easy, easier then how it would work with the Cintiq's official included stand yet it also does so much more then it ever could.Wacom should partner up with these guys and include the Ergotron with all tablets light enough to work well with them. Speaking of which, I got a 22hd not only because it's cheaper then a 24hd, but also because I knew it would be a better fit for the ergotron and how I'd use it, in addition to being under the max weight limit. This ergotron arm is so strong, and I could easily tighten it up to support even more weight. It would not surprise me at all if it can work well with the 24hd if you took off its' monstrous 60 pound stand, but technically even then you will still be over the weight limit.The clamp base has holes in it, so you can also drill screws through it to make it more secure. I have not drilled any screws to reinforce it, nor would I want to. Like all pieces of this arm, the clamp is very heavy sturdy steal, and very tightly has been clamped into place. I tried to see if I could make it budge or make it slide around, and I can't. This is a much more solid stable clamp then the pictures show. The Cintiq and arm mount are not going to slip off and fall over unless my entire desk does. As stable as the ergotron is, there is a little shake as I press more firmly and work quickly with the stylus, but this isn't an issue imo, and a very small price to pay to have such a mobile screen.My only complaints after a month and a half of heavy use, is I do think the instructions could have been.... better. And having a hallow part in the upper arm section to hold the cables, but to me that really isn't a big deal at all. I haven't used other lcd arms, so I can't say if this is the best one the market or not, I just know that for my needs this thing is legendary.I knew I'd love this product, but I didn't know it would be so good that I wished I could rate it higher then a 5.",2

W. Dietrich,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023","I've been using this daily for about a month now. I have an unusual setup for my computer ""station"" which is my recliner with this monitor arm attached to a printer table to the side of my chair. I swing the monitor to in front of me while working on the computer (by working I mean gaming) and anytime I get up I have to swing the monitor out of the way. It gets a lot of use every day. And whenever my cat wants to join in with ""working"" I lift the monitor up higher and tilt it down slightly so my cat can sleep on my chest and I can see over her.OK the nuts and bolts of it.It swings around easily, lifts up or down easily without moving on it's own and most importantly to me it stays tilted in whatever amount of tilt I give it. My old monitor holder would tilt completely face down all on it's own (then I would need to get the Allen wrench and push and pull it back into position and lock it down again), this one hasn't shown any tendency to do that at all. Nice.Assembly is easy. Clamp the base to a table (or drill a hole and use the hole mount) using the huge star shaped clamp screw, it's big enough to need just your hand and not need tools, next adjust the height of the arm stop if needed, the swing arm just slides over the base rod (no screws or bolts) and sits on top of the height adjustment. The second arm connects the same way as the first arm connected... slide it over the post on the first arm. The plate that attaches to the monitor comes with it's own screws that have huge knob heads that don't need tools to tighten. Then align the part attached to the monitor with the end of the swing arm and drop the big pin through the holes of both parts. That's it, all done except for connecting the power and video cables.I was planning to use the through the hole mount on this but tried first the table clamp. Glad I did because it works very well. The arm has a huge range of rotation... if it wasn't for the cabling to the monitor it could turn 360 degrees endlessly.  With the rod the arm sits on (which can be adjusted for height when clamped to the table top) and the two arm joints, one between the two arm sections and one for the monitor there is a wide range of adjustment to position the monitor. Plus the monitor can be adjusted side to side, rotated to portrait or land scape mode, moved up and down and tilted.The only thing that would prevent this monitor holder from being your perfect monitor holder would be if you don't have a table top to attach it to.",1

This mount is not a set-and-leave type, where you need to set it once and stick with that location.  You can adjust it as much as you want, and it holds position.  The only adjustment that may take some time to make is the position of the arm on the pole, because a ring underneath the arm must be adjusted to maintain the height position.  However, the height range without adjusting the arm is already pretty significant, and I do not see that it would be necessary to adjust the arm height on the pole very often.  Adjustments are smooth and they stick - I do not have problems with the monitor falling out of position after I adjust it.The other reason that I picked this particular unit (besides the ability to adjust frequently and easily) is the tall pole.  This provides a larger range of movement, and if your monitor is on the upper end of the rated size scale, you will probably need it.  I was really happy about this choice, and although I have  not really needed that extra height yet, I am really happy that I have the potential for it.When the mount arrived in the box, my first impression was that the parts were all solid and well-made, heavy construction.  Assembly was really easy (no-brainer) and when put together, it was clear that the quality construction was as solid as I thought, and all parts worked smoothly together and fit easily. Ergotron did not stinge on any of the parts - they are all solid, good quality.I mounted it to the desk with the clamp, instead of drilling holes, because the desk will be moved to a new apartment soon, and I want to have flexibility of placement in the new place.  The clamp provided good stability for my monitor, and I have had no problems with vibrations or the clamp slipping while I am adjusting.  I may leave it in the clamp even after moving, since I have not had any problems with it.I was torn about purchasing the dual mount so that I could have the flexibility of setting up dual monitors in the future, but ultimately decided not to.  Now that I have the mount, I realize that I can buy the same mount again and mount both arms on a single pole to achieve the same setup as the dual mount system.  Or I can set the mounts side by side.  So, I feel I made the right choice and I am not limited.Overall summary: highly recommend!Pros: quality parts, solid construction, easy assembly, easy adjustment, adjustments hold after you make them, extra height range with tall pole, choice between clamp or through-desk mounting, rotates freely between portrait and landscape viewing (fun fact - this rotational direction is not limited at all except by your cables that will wind up if you continue to rotate - you could keep rotating indefinitely if your monitor were cordless).Cons: takes a little more time to adjust the height position of the arm on the pole (this is no big deal for me). Also, having a wall directly behind the mount will limit movement away from you to some degree, because the arm will be restricted by the wall - you will not be able to retract it as far against the wall as you would if the desk were free-standing.  However, it seems obvious that you will not be able to achieve the full range of movement if there are obstructions.",1

The LX has a capacity rating of 20lbs, and it extends 2 feet. I'd be trusting the construction of it to hold up my $2000 tablet in the air safely! So you can't blame me. However, after receiving the LX in the mail, it was definitely far better built than I thought it would have been. No plastic parts -- all 100% (heavy) metal. It came with mount hardware to clamp onto the edge of your desk, or drill through your desk for inner-surface placement. I tried it on the edge of my desk first, and while the clamp held firm and showed no signs of falling off, let's face it, I'm taking no chances here. I also wanted a little more ""universal"" flexibility in accessing the cintiq, so it being off to the opposite edge of my desk was a little too far away. Thus, I measured out the optimal spot to drill a hole in my desk and mounted it SOLIDLY through the top. I have an IKEA Gallant corner desk, so I drilled it through right where the curved-corner area is. Drilled and bolted in place, there's absolutely 0% change of the clamp failing and falling off the desk, and the arm can reach both sides of the desk easily.(I'll be submitting some user pictures so you can see my Cintiq setup with the LX. Check them out!)So now with my 21UX on the LX, it allows me to ""float"" the 21UX in front of me, lowered to hang half-off the edge of my desk. It's basically in my lap by this point, offering me optimal ergonomic usage. I find myself no longer slouching when I draw, and I can withstand much longer sessions of drawing in my chair. It's nice that I can *float* the cintiq to where I need it, instead of moving to where it needs me to be.Another reviewer here on Amazon wrote that the LX had a hard time holding up his 21UX, and it would slowly droop over time from the weight. I'm wondering if he carefully tightened the primary tension bolt at the top of the arm? I had to put a lot of tension into the arm, at roughly around 85% tightened. But at that amount, the LX holds the 21UX unbelievably firm, in the air or lowered onto my desk in drawing position.Really you can't go wrong with the Ergotron LX. I'm literally using it with, probably, the toughest thing it will ever have to go up against. I feel safe with my 21UX mounted to it. It's that solid. Sure, there's a little bit of wobble if it's free floating -- but it's nothing that appears concerning, not like the thing's about to break or something. In fact, the Ergotron wobbles less with the Cintiq on it than my NEC monitor on its stock stand. How's that for overbuilt?It's really worth the investment for all 21UX owners who want some greater control over this behemoth. I even recommend it as a top-notch (and good looking) option to those looking for articulate arms for their normal LCD monitors, or hell, even your 12WX if you got one. Ergotron makes other attachments for the arm, such as extenders and a laptop tray. You can really make it work for your workspace well. It's nice being able to simply push the Cintiq out of the way to be up next to my primary monitor when it's not in use. It's nice to reclaim some of that desk space since the Ergotron mount has considerably less footprint than the Cintiq on its stock stand.Stop looking, get this mount. You won't find a better one for this weight range.",1

I plan on ordering a 3rd. They are expensive but I definitely feel like it’s worth the extra money. They are extremely simple to set up and even easier to adjust tension. Mine are holding up two 32” monitors with ease. The desk footprint is a bit larger than others I have used but they definitely feel more sturdy with the extra contact area to desk. The white and grey match my pc and monitor. I think they are much better looking than black ones. My only complaint would be that when fully raised the center of the monitor is not exactly the center of pole. It’s offset by 3/4” when pushed all the way back.  That could be because of the geometry of my monitor and no fault of the stand. My monitor is pretty wideFront to back so it may line up with a slimmer model.,1

I have to concur.This thing is a beast, made of solid aluminum and made with heavy-duty metal springs and joints, and while it says the rated weight is 20-25 pounds, I am fairly certain it is strong enough to hold far more (But dont quote me on that), as the 27QHD weighs just shy of 20 pounds and this thing does not even flinch when holding it in any position. It takes a bit of getting use to in order to properly attune it to the weight, but that goes for anything you put on it really. It also has wire management that allows you to run cops from the monitor through the frame of the arm itself, a couple twist ties for cord management, etc.Which is another advantage this arm has over the stand: Positioning. While the Ergostand may be more stable overall, it can only move the screen vertically a small bit. The Ergotron XL Arm has much better movement and range, such as actually lifting it up so you can stand and use it at a comfortable height, move the screen to the side so you have space for other things when not in use, or even being able to completely rotate the screen around, which for a digital tablet is absolutely useful for getting those perfect strokes without having to mess with the actual application orientation, or for getting the right shape screen you would prefer, such as preferring ""Portrait"" over 'Landscape"", for example. For someone that has to use this thing for hours and hours every day, the mobility the Arm affords you is indispensable for comfort and flexibility.I believe the weight rating applies to the fact that with enough weight on the end of this thing floating around, it will be putting quite a bit of strain on the desk/table/whatever to which it is mounted, potentially causing enough strain to break the desk/table/whatever.  Considering that whatever is attached to this thing most likely costs at least as much as the arm itself, I would assume you do not want that happening. However, even just the arms neutral position (Letting the top arm rest on top of the mounting bar) holds the monitor fairly well and still provides a wider range of motion than the Ergostand while not putting as much pressure on the desk as if the arm were extended.For this particular device I had to use an adapter since the base VESA screws for this arm are only 100x100, but thats not a big deal, it works well with any adapter.Overall very pleased with this purchase, a good investment no doubt.",1

Had to fiddle with it once the tablet was mounted so i could access some of the tension spots but watching videos helps.Im using it with a long ikea desk (1 inch thick) and my cintiq pro 24"". It holds the weight perfectly and i can draw without it moving around unexpectedly.However, im mounting it in a way that isnt shown in the manual (so the rating is still good, the product is fine... My desk is not) but if you are planning something similar to me, know that an ikea desk WILL NOT hold the weight of a heavier tablet or monitor.My current desk set up consists of 2 monitors and a cintiq 22hd (none mounted) and I was using the arm to give myself space for the cintiq pro. Since i also stream, i needed it placed in a way that allowed me to move it out of sight as needed.I placed the arm on the front of the desk, about 6 inches from the right side. It held up fine without the tablet and easily moved around my monitors, to my chair, and out of the way again.However, the cintiq pro series is very heavy (about 30-45 lbs). The desk lasted about 1.5 hours before cracking and i had to take it off before losing a chunk of the desk along with my new tablet. This was caused due to the pressure of the arm being focused on the side of the main bracket, as opposed to the front of it. The pressure was too much and it sunk into the ""wood"" top.  I knew what the risk was by doing this and expected this to happen, so i want suprised, but wanted to let buyers know to reinforce or rethink their positioning.This can probably be fixed by making sure you have a heavy duty top, additional under support, and/or an additional leg installed near the arm.Luckily this was a garbage desk i got from a friend so i wasted no money in the test.Arm is great though! Works better than i thought it would honestly :) very useful",0

It took about 20 minutes to install. The only tool required was a small screwdriver to remove the mount from my monitor (It's a Dell 2407WFP, by the way).My desk has a glass top surface (on top of wood), so I was worried about the stand scratching the glass, cracking the glass, or not getting a good fit against the glass. Luckily, the base has rubber pads so that it grips the glass very well without scratching it.The build quality is excellent. The parts are weighty and feel solid. The monitor moves around very well and has quite a large range of motion on this arm. One odd aspect of the installation is that the 2 articulated arms are not bolted together in anyway -- each one sits on top of a plastic flange and is held in place just by the weight of the monitor. This sounds like a shaky set up but it works out nicely in practice, although there is a little bit of play around each flange (given that they are not manufactured perfectly).The one drawback is the cable management system. The lower arm (which is optional) has a removable cover and is hollow so that you can route wires through it. However, neither the base nor the upper arm has any built in cable management. Seems weird (to me) to have the capability only in one part (and the optional part, at that) and not have it in the two required parts. Even weirder, they include 2 cable ties in the box so that you can cable tie your wires to the upper arm to hold them in place. This was the option I chose, and it works fine, so my rating is still 5 stars, even though it is an odd design.I was able to get a couple square feet of usable desk space by using this arm instead of the standard monitor base, plus I can now swing the monitor around to watch movies from my bed (it's a weird angle -- the room is L-shaped), and to top it all off, I got overnight delivery for free :) Highly recommended.UPDATE:After using this for several years, I still love it. In fact, I just ordered a second one to go to a dual-display set up.When I moved a couple years ago, I lost the plastic flange that fits inside this arm. I emailed Ergotron to tell them about this, and they mailed me a new flange for free. They didn't even charge me for shipping. That level of customer service is so rare!!! I'd give 6 stars if I could.",1

I love the look of the matte black and how much more desk space they have given me and how easy they are to put together. They clip to the back of the desk in the form of a mount and are easy to adjust to where ever you might need them to be placed. The bases are large and study but smaller than the monitor stand base which is great for saving room. They are adjustable up and down along with swiveling in and out. I've had these for a couple years now and have no intention of changing them out. Sure they are worth a pretty penny but if you have a heavier monitor it is worth it to have piece of mind that they will not drop your monitor.I would be careful about making the tightness too much on the mounts though as if you do, it will mark the pole with a silver circle from the Allen Wrench spot. It might not matter to most as that would normally be on the back but I rotated my adjustment hole to the front due to owning a L-shaped desk. It was easier for me this way then needing to pull the desk away from the wall each time I wanted to change something about my set up.",1

I always had a hard time getting the included stand to rotate the screen properly, and since I use a dual screen set-up, it was an absolute pain to comfortably position the keyboard/mouse for other functions on my cluttered desk. This ergonomic desk mount has solved all my problems.I wasn't totally sold that this mount could actually hold something as heavy as a Cintiq, but sure enough it can. I can float it around my desk and it seems to stay in place no matter how I position it. You do have to tighten all of the joints quite a bit before it will hold, but within 10 minutes of assembly I was happy with the tightness.Assembly is very easy, though I would recommend asking a friend to help you when you put the monitor on to ensure you don't drop your screen. There are 3 main parts that just pop together and it includes all necessary screws and a few tools to help adjust things. However, you'll need a Phillips screw driver to finish mounting your screen.I like that it clamps onto the desk, so you don't have to destroy a desk to use it. I also like that it has a huge range of rotation in pretty much every direction. You can spin your screen 360 degrees in either direction and move it left and right as far as your screen's cable will let you. It does move up and down, but you have a limited range of heights to choose from. You can still get it pretty far in either direction though so it's not too much of an issue. At its lowest setting, you can easily get a screen into your lap (my favorite feature for the Cintiq), and at its highest you can probably get 6 or 7 inches of clearance off the desk. You can choose to lock the arm into a certain position or leave it flexible. Even when flexible it holds its position unless you force it to move, so you don't have to worry about it dropping your screen.If you're a Cintiq 21UX user, definitely get this arm. It's amazing how flexible my Cintiq has become with it. I always hated the stand it came with since it forced you to strategically place the unit. With this arm you can just move it around with ease and set your desk up however you want. You can also finally sit back in your chair and draw!This arm will fit pretty much any screen under 20lbs, but I'd only recommend buying this if you intend to move your screen around a lot.",1

This is fantastic, but whether I was standing or sitting, I always came back to the same problem - my monitor height from the base of my desk was too low. What started out as a search for just a monitor stand eventually turned into a search for monitor arms because, let's face it, having options is never a bad thing. So, I spent a lot of time looking at various monitor arms in the $30-$60 range. Over a long week, I patiently read all reviews, noted the different arm combinations/dimensions, and paid particular attention to the cons of each product. Although it hurt my eyes the first time I saw the price tag on this beauty, I eventually realized it was the closest thing I would find to meet my functional expectations, and settling for anything else would probably bring more frustration than satisfaction in the long term. Ever bought something cheaper in order to save money, but ended up getting rid of it and buying the more expensive item anyway? Yeah, that sucks because you end up paying even more than the original cost. So... I stopped procrastinating and decided I would give it a shot, besides, we're talking about Amazon - I could always return it if I didn't like it. :)Here are some bullet points taken from my overall experience:-setup out of the box was easy-the mount/arm are very well built-my desk is less than one inch, but the mount fit like a glove and the unit is very firm!My overall productivity at my work desk has increased greatly. Now that I'm able to move into whatever position is comfortable, and manipulate my monitor position with ease, I am not sure how I ever lived without it. I am also very happy that I didn't ""cheap out"" and buy some of the other monitor arms that I was looking at previously. Speaking of which, one of them was a monitor arm attached to a 31 inch pole. Imagine that... a 31 inch pole protruding from the base of your desk like a giant antenna. No way! The Ergotron arm is very stylish, highly functional, exceptionally well built, and very easy to adjust. It has exceeded my initial expectations. It is a dream. I keep thinking it's going to disappear because it's too good to be true. Although it's not always the case, sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I'm very happy for making this purchase... very satisfied with the results.",2

Once I understood though, it was all very simple.The arm mount had surprising weight to it out of the box. I mean I guess it has to be strong if its holding up a screen I just wasn't expecting it. Not a con, just, surprised.My real mistake was not putting the mounted screen on first and attaching it to the corresponding piece on the arm mount. (pretty sure this is step one in the visual instructions). The reason I overlooked this was I initally fearful the piece and screen would slip from my hands and fall onto my glass desk as I tried to set up the mount in the right position. They also gave no written reasoning for why this was the first step so I thought it was just one of those steps I could skip and come back to..Apparently not.So, I tried to assemble the mount by itself, leaving the screen until last in my excitment and just before i screwed the screen on I realised it wasn't rotating as I was told it would. It was rather stiff and I tried unscrew all possible points where the mount might be loosened, but to no avail. Going over the instructions throroughly, I was more n more frustrated and sorely lost. I'm no engineer or product designer so in laymans terms: the screens weight is used by the air pump inside the arm mount to help it move around as it should. without the screen attached, it wont budge, even if you put all your weight on it. Least in my case anyways.  So if i'd followed the instructions unclear as they seemed, it would have been more simple to put together.The performance of the mount is brilliant. It doesn't move from it spot aside from a slight upward pull due to the air pump, but its minimal and not enough to interfere with your line of sight. The only issue I had as a digital artist with my tablet attached to this, was when rotating the screen various degrees, I often forgot about my cords that ran through the kindly given managment slots and combined with the constant rotating this way and that, I bent important cords slightly because of the pull. Will have to be more careful in the future.Overall great product even if I personally found the instructions difficult.",-1

Both arms are Innovative brand 7000 series, considered industry quality high use business arms. I will compare the two below.Stability:In comparison, the Ergotron arm is a little more jiggly, but not enough to affect your computing work. The Innovative is solid.Mounting:Both can mount through desk, and when mounted in this way both are equally strong. The Ergotron out performs the Innovative 10-1 when clamped to the side of a desk, having a large and solid base and knob that can be hand tightened. The clamp comes completely assembled. The Ergotron arm also allows for differing desk thicknesses for mounting, while the Innovative does not--but is plenty deep for anything I can imagine to which you might want to mount it. Between the two, the Ergotron is the easiest to mount, and for side desk mounting, the most solid.The Innovative arm requires you to build the clamp and use an Allen wrench to tighten it to the desk. The clamping piece is thick enough, but not wide enough, and it doesn't give you the ability to mount the clamping mechanism deeper when space allows. I had one of my monitors fall off once because the side mount clamp worked loose.Fluidity:Both arms are satisfactory, but the Ergotron arm is quite a bit easier to move and more fluid. The Innovative is a little stiff for my taste. (Update: October 22, 2010. I finally had had it with the Innovative rotation plate sticking. I took it apart and put a wedge between the pin and backing and hit it with a hammer, lightly, in order to loosen it a little. The cast steel pin just popped off. It's just too tight, and not adjustable, from the factory. Monitor rotation is extremely sticky and annoying to adjust. Depending on the replacement part price, I may just trash that arm and buy another Ergotron.)Price:No comparison. You can buy almost three Ergotron arms for the price of one Innovative arm, of which then 7000 series go for around 310.00USD each.I really have no problems with either product's quality, but the side mount engineering of the Innovative arm is a nader compared to the quality of the arm itself, and so too for the rotation difficulties. If I had to buy all three arms again, I'd go with Ergotron, mainly for the price but also for the superior desk clamp and movement fluidity. However, I've had the Innovative arms for over two years with no mechanical problems, and the Ergotron only a month.",1

As others have said in their reviews, the photos do not really show the solid quality of this monitor arm; this LX arm is top quality steel.  That's right, not plastic, not aluminum, but steel.  The only plastic part is a decorative panel that hides the cables along the bottom of the arm.  Anything that is weight baring is made of heavy gauge steel.  Also, as some else said in their review the Ergotron arm looks like someone shipped you the arm of some futuristic robot.I bought this LX desk mount to hold a LG 34"" UltraWide monitor (the 34UM95-P).  Ergotron recommends the MX desk mount for large and heavy monitors, but I have had this for over 2 months now and everything is great.  Even though the LG 34UM95 is a 34"" monitor it only weighs 14.9 pounds (6.75 kg) without its stand, and the LX desk mount can hold up to 25 pounds (11.3 kg).I was concerned before I bought the LX arm that the LG, being an UltraWide monitor, would wobble from movement on my desk.  Once the LG monitor was mounted and the tension in the LX arm was properly adjusted the monitor is as steady as a rock with no wobble.  I can work and write on my desk and the monitor never moves from whatever position I have it in.Being able to have my monitor mounted on this arm has helped a lot.  My desk is now clear to host whatever I want to do, such as a graphics tablet; various books open to reference; or a midi keyboard.  My last computer was an iMac, and even though it is a great computer it dominated my desktop.  I wish I would have known then to get an Ergotron arm (specifically if you have an iMac get the Ergotron DX arm, since it can hold the weight of the iMac).  Now that I have seen the quality and superior function of a monitor mounted to an Ergotron arm I will never not have one.I am already making plans to get a second LX arm to hold my laptop,  a third arm to hold a Wacom tablet, and the keyboard try arm that mounts under the desk.  I am going to have so many arms that people are going to mistake me for Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock) from Spiderman.",2

I've only had them a couple of months, so time will tell with regard to durability.The look of the white is really classy and works well with my office.  I ordered the silver/black ones before I saw these available...The silver and black ones are great for some peoples' set ups, I'm sure, but for my office, there's a lot of gray and white, and this looks perfect.Overall, very pleased.

I purchased this arm along with the laptop tray also sold by Ergotron for my Cintiq 13HD. Needless to say this review will be most helpful for artists with a digital drawing tablet who seek to mount it on an arm.I heard this arm in particular was a favorite among Wacom tablet users, so decided to go for the plunge. Wacom Cintiq13HDs do not have a port on the back for mounting however, so I had to consider a laptop tray as well. I ordered the arm and tray with Prime. It shipped and arrived on my doorstep in two days. It came almost entirely assembled, separated into the three different arm parts. After ogling the directions and trying to figure out how to adjust the tension on the different parts, I now have it fully assembled and attached to a sturdy table nearby my desk. The idea of the arm was to free up valuable desk space and help make my freelance art business a little more efficient, since I had to put my tablet away every time I wanted to use the computer without having the tablet in my way on the desk.So far I am very happy with the purchase. Both the arm and the tray work beautifully together. The lowest tension for the up and down tilt of the tray happened to be just right; I can adjust it on the fly if needed, but the pressure I put on my tablet when drawing does not push it back down as well. Another perk for artists using this is the fact that your tablet is no longer resting on the desk and is propped up at an angle, which means you can practice drawing with your whole arm rather than just your wrist, ultimately keeping carpal tunnel at bay.The arm itself is incredibly sturdy and very well made, with a nice professional looking finish. It wobbles a little around the rod on the clamp that holds it to the table, but I'm sure that can be fixed with a little adjusting. It honestly doesn't bother me enough to consider tweaking it though.All in all I would highly recommend this arm to anybody with a graphic tablet in need of desk space, or are seeking a more comfortable graphic design experience.",-1

Everyone talks about how high these monitors arms can be adjusted, but I am short and was interested in lowering the monitor to avoid looking up and resulting neck pain.  I was looking for a stand that would allow me to place the monitor very close to the desk with about 1/4 on an inch clearance.  I also wanted to be able to move the monitor close to me when I am using it, and out of the way when  I am not using it.This Ergotron LX arm performs these tasks well because it has more joints than some of the other arms on the market and extra joints provide more flexibility. The arm is very sturdy, and handle the weight of my 24"" wide screen monitor well. It stays securely in place, yet remains easy to reposition.INSTALLATIONI ran into a couple of glitches during the installation1) The join that attaches to the monitor was extremely stiff. In the instructions and YouTube videos it is shown perpendicular to the monitor.  When it arrived it was aligned flat for packing and I could not budge it no matter how hard I tried. I had to get a man with muscles to force into the right position.  It took him quite a while, as he was afraid to break it by forcing it too hard, but eventually he gave it all he had and it moved.2) The installation instructions claim that desk clamp can be attached to desks from with thickness from .4"" to 2.4"". My desk is 1 3/4"" thick and I could not open the clamp wide enough to put it on. Luckily I have a thin leaf (6/8"") that comes out of the desk and the clamp attached to that just fine.I am very pleased with Ergotron LX arm and my new set up. I am attaching the photo that demonstrates the mounting of the new 24"" monitor along with the old 19"" inch monitor for dual monitor set up.Ali Julia review",1

Fit and finish are excellent and adjustments are smooth and easy. It's well designed and looks professional and classy, with real metal accents that appear to be brushed stainless steel. The materials used are top notch. All of the structural components are made of steel. These days, it's great to find a product that doesn't use plastic just to cut costs, even on stress-bearing parts that should  be made of metal. The only plastic parts I spotted are the end cap of the vertical base tube and cable management fitting. The manufacturer clearly cared more about quality than cutting corners. Mine had some light scratches on the brushed stainless steel parts, which aren't noticeable unless looking closely. I don't know if it was a return or if they're all like that.What I like best about this mount is the wide range of adjustment it allows. I have it mounted on the rear edge of my desk and can bring the monitor forward enough so that I can kick back in my chair with feet on the desk and still have it at a comfortable viewing distance. The height is adjustable enough so that I can rotate my 27"" widescreen to portrait mode, not that I plan to do so on a regular basis. Any monitor larger than 27"" would not work in portrait mode with this mount due to insufficient clearance at maximum height. The mounting hardware permits it to be mounted on desks of varying thicknesses and there's also a fitting to allow mounting using a small hole in the desktop.Pretty much all of the benefits mentioned in the product description are accurate and not exaggerated. This mount has helped reduce neck and shoulder pain, eye strain and probably back pain, since I no longer have to adjust my posture to suit the monitor's position or struggle to read on a screen that's too far back. I also bought the
332B Notebook/Laptop Extension Stand Desktop Clamp
for my laptop, together with the Ergotron. With these mounts, I've reclaimed quite a bit of desktop space, making it easier to stay organized.This mount is a good value and well worth the price. It's built to last and will improve workspace comfort for many years to come. Highly recommended.",1

The install went smooth with relatively easy to follow instructions (though the drawings were laid out in a pretty odd order) and sits nicely on my desk.Personally I used it for my Cintiq (which I don't have set up fully since I need to order a DVI-I extension cable, since on my last order I was sent the wrong cable) and it works perfectly, BUT... it feels like the Cintiq, despite still having a couple lbs of weight before being at the Ergotron's max supported weight, is really pushing the Ergotron to it's limits.The way I have my desk set up, an ideal situation would be two Ergotron LX desk mounts with an additional Extension arm for each to make them reach further attached to my 2 monitors, but unfortunately I don't trust it to support the weight of my Cintiq with an additional arm (the further away from the base, the more stress that will be placed on it).My only other concern would be that no felt was included, so with a heavy monitor attached to a desk can easily scar the desk, I'll be picking some up and attaching to it myself so my desk doesn't get ruined should I decide to remove the arm at a later date.I guess I write this review for two reasons:1) Ergotron LX is an excellent adjustable arm and I would recommend it to anyone with a Cintiq that has thought about the investment in the past.2) I also write this as a note to Ergotron developers: there is a definite market need for us Wacom Cintiq Users.  If Ergotron made the arm support a few more lbs (30 would be ideal) while having the reach of the LX + an additional extension arm, you'd have one HELL of a product for artists and drafters that use the Cintiq line of pen tablets.  So, Ergotron, if you ever come out with a product like that, marked somewhere in the 200-400 dollar range, I'd be interested in buying one (or two).  The distance is very important, because ideally, we'd bring it to our chairs so we can reduce stress on our backs while working (leaning forward or even sitting straight up and reaching arms out to the desk is incredibly painful after years of work).",1

I went back and forth on which model to get, either this or the one intended for heavier screens but once I got this set up it has been perfect.At first the arm didn’t seem strong enough to hold my monitor up, but a quick search showed me a specific bolt to tighten for increasing the vertical resistance and I quickly had it dialed in.The cable routing is nice and the clamp holds very securely on my desk (husky adjustable workbench wood top).  There is some wobble if you wiggle the desk too much (common for arms I think) but it’s really not bad and settles down quickly.My only gripe is that even after inserting the rotation locking screw there is still a fair amount of play left to right rotationally that has me spending a few seconds re-leveling my screen after any move.  Pretty minor issue though.Overall, this is a great monitor arm that should last a long time and has already allowed me to reclaim the dead space my old stand took up on my desk.  Highly recommend.",1

When anyone needs a raising desk, we always purchase Ergotron. There is no better raising desks on Amazon better than Ergotrons. You get tons of space with this desk and it sits super low to the desk for people who might be shorter and need the extra few inches for their desk to be level.(At sitting level) We purchased this for a lady at work that is a little on the short side and she wanted something that was going to sit as low as possible in the sitting position. Speaking of height, I'm 6'4"" and I was able to raise this desk up to a comfortable height and it still was able to go up even higher. The only thing I could complain about, and this isn't even about this specific product, is that their lower end monitor mount, for this desk, is way over priced for what it is. I don't even think you get a tilt feature. It's just a metal rod that hold's the monitor in place. They do have a one that has adjustable features, but you'd almost have to spend more on the adjustable arm than the desk. If you order a monitor arm, order somewhere else on Amazon and not Ergotron.",1

I've not had that many chairs, but this chair is not comfortable. I work from home and spend most of the day sitting down. I had to purchase a memory foam seat cushion in order to not have lower back pain or discomfort in my legs/butt. For $600, this was a complete waste of money. The seat just has very little cushion or support, so after a few hours of sitting down (without the memory foam cushion) my back would start hurting or I'd otherwise feel uncomfortable. I also dislike that there is no head rest. The only good things about this chair are that assembly was easy and the adjustability is pretty good. Overall, do not recommend this chair, ESPECIALLY at $600 (which is crazy because $600 is a 'good' deal for this chair, compared to the normal price).",-1

I'm surprised that some of the earlier reviews are saying it's not worth the $400 they paid for it.  I WISH I would have paid $400 for the chair in this age of inflation, but at about $570 that I paid it's still a good deal given that new Steelcase chairs in this model run from $1100 t0 $1300+.  The re-manufacturing appears at this time to be first rate.  The back and pad are made well, although the seat foam does compress a bit more than I thought it would.  May need to supplement that for long haul work sessions.  Also the arm rest tops are a bit on the loose side, but not a deal breaker.  Also, it could have been lubricated better, especially around the reclining hardware which is chattering due to a need for lubricant.  I noticed the vid presented by Crandall shows an employee using WD-40 to lubricate.  While you should be careful of over spray by blocking off the area to be lubricated with a rag, and only spray very small amounts at a time, White Lithium grease is far superior to WD-40, which will wear off quickly. Lubricate the wear/friction points BEFORE assembly to make it easier on yourself.  The other point relates to insertion of the gas cylinder.  The instructions can easily be mis-read that you need to have a base insert for your cylinder if you don't catch the ""IF your chair comes with..."". As a note, the Leap V2 does not require the sleeve.  All in all a good deal, will adjust the review accordingly as time passes.Edit#1: I'm docking a star now that I've had time to use it.  The seat padding is definitely NOT up to Steelcase standards, but not terrible. While Crandall says they put a thicker pad on that Steelcase, it's a lesson that quantity doesn't always add up to quality.  The Steelcase foam has a different consistency to it, more along the line of latex which has much better support to compression ratio over time. It's good for around 6 hours before you need to get up and walk around a bit. I supplemented mine with a mesh pad. Also, I'm at a loss how the recline feature still chatters at certain positions. I can't tell where it's happening in order to apply lubricant.  Still, the chair is made well, but the padding piece is disappointing. Not enough to warrant a return though.  The other piece is the armrest, they are hard.  I needed to add some padding to those as well.  I'm sure the frame and mechanisms of the chair will make it worth the price compared to the fly-by-night import company versions.  Just wish they would have worked to get a closer match to the Steelcase foam as opposed to throwing more of a less dense type at it.Edit #2: I'm dropping my review an additional star.  It's been 7 months since I've owned this chair. I work from home and am in IT so the chair gets used a lot.  The seat foam used by Crandall has gotten worse with time.  Sure it gets used a lot, but what office chair doesn't?  I'm not a huge man, about 6', 180lbs, so on the up side of average. The foam is obviously suffering from compression damage, in that the cells are breaking with use, so the foam doesn't have its previous resiliancy (which was lacking to begin with). Also, I'm still living with the noise when sitting back.  I begin to question if this chair was worth what I paid, when not I'm almost hoping that the frame fails so I have a good reason to find another chair.  It is very disappointing considering how much I paid for it. As you can see the pad does become a deal breaker with the passage of time.Edit#3: It's been almost 2 years now and the breakdown of the foam in the seat continues to the point that the chair has become unusable without a supplemental pad.  I'm using a pad made from Dunlop Latex which is closer to the resilience of a true Steelcase chair pad.  I'm sorely disappointed in this company, they must have known they were using cheap foam due to their overt marketing about the ""extra thick seat foam"".  One of those psych the customer out strategies to make us think the thing was actually comfortable.  Not sure if I've got any recourse as I believe 12 year warranty conveniently only covers the frame.  So, hats off to their business model strategy: Get tough as nails used chair frames from Steelcase, clean them, touch up the finish, then throw the cheapest foam you can get on the seat and don't cover it under the warranty.  Well played sirs, well played and we've all been played.",1

Kudos to the Steelcase marketing department, because it isn't.  It's OK at best... About the same as the $99 chair I bought it to replace.I am 6'3"" and the arm rests on this chair are 4"" ( 4!!!!!! ) too low at their highest settings. They might as well not even be there. It's also pretty annoying that the armrests slide all over the place with no way to lock them in place.The lumbar support is not forceful enough even when dialed up all the way. It's like a strap going across the back.The back rest is all flexy and way too thin.Also, I wish the cushion was scooped out a bit more around the tailbone area.  Crandall should offer this as an option maybe.It just stinks that there's no way to sit in a $650 office chair BEFORE you buy it. But that's the world of ecommerce in which we live.  I know the perfect chair for me exists, but I'll never find it unless I spend $10,000.",-1

I did *a lot* of research, watching reviews, reading reddit opinions and the consensus was A) gaming chairs are all crap and B) the Steelcase Leap v2 is the best you can get. However brand new they are very expensive ($1500-$2k) but after reading more reviews, I kept seeing Crandall pop up again and again as a good place to get a used Leap V2Now you can can get a used leap V2 cheaper elsewhere, however the reason its worth it to spend $600 at Crandall is their warranty guarantee (12 years) and the amount of work they put into refurbishing the chair. Everything from deep cleaning, new casters, new (thicker!) seat pad, etc the chair looks like it just came off the factory floor. Putting the chair together was super easy, their instructions are very detailed (see picture), you will not see poorly-explained Ikea-esq diagrams here! They also have a customer support hotline.As for comfort, others have explained better than me, but the amount of adjustability options this chair has are amazing. Once I had everything set up, I can sit in this thing for hours and not have any back issues or discomfort. I expect this chair will last me a long, long time and highly recommend!",1

Even though I didn't go with them, you have to thank BTOD for their quality content and even letting me know that this who remastered Leap thing existed.After watching many videos and reading opinions all over the internet, I decided to go with Crandall. BTOD has a lot of reviews saying it takes a while to get the chair, and I didn't want to wait so Crandall it was! Seeing I could buy through them on Amazon, as a Prime member, was even sweeter.After purchasing, it was said I wouldn't get the chair for around 2 weeks but I came in less than one.Now to the chair. It's perfect. I haven't had it long so I can't speak to long term, but I can say that it looks brand new all around and performs amazingly with no problems. Assembly took around 10-15 minutes with everything mostly put together already.The fabric is all brand new, and you can tell the seat looks a bit more substantial than the regular Leaps in the videos due to Crandall replacing the padding.The chair itself is much heavier than it looks and it's obvious immediately that this thing is the real deal compared to the $200 cheap ones I've been using. I'm 5'8 170 with short legs and the chair is able to fit me just fine. Due to the other adjustment options, like the seat sliding, this could definitely accommodate a much larger person as well.Great chair. Great company. Very happy with my purchase.Will update if something happens or in 6 months and a year since that matters for an every day office chair.",2

I assured her, it has a 12-year warranty. 12 years means that Crandall Office really trusts itself with my spine and butt-cheeks. I reminded my mom that I was getting a degree in computer science. Either I learn to float while spending hours at my desk or get a new chair.Main Review:1. Assembly:I have sticks for arms. If you have to bring it upstairs, I recommend opening the box and taking up each part one by one.Assembly was easy until sliding the seat into the seat glides. It took more than 20 tries to get it on. Either I'd put it in and the seat glides fall out, or it doesn't click in place. Since I couldn't see where I was sliding into the seat, it was a bunch of finger-crossing and guesswork. Once the seat was in, it was all sunshine and rainbows.2.) FeelI'm incredibly short (F), 4'11"" (150cm). So I have to put the chair and armrests at maximum height in order to align myself with my desk. I have to hop on the chair to get on it. My legs dangle off the floor. I can criss-cross-apple-sauce while sitting. I don't need a headrest. All the benefits/woes of a petite person.Regardless of my ""short""comings, this chair is crazy comfortable. I was used to the abuse of my old chair. I forgot that I can sit back and relax while simultaneously typing. I can push back and the chair reclines backward along with me. I don't even know what a lumbar is, but it's being supported. I have had 0 upper back pain since the purchase of this chair.Thanks Crandall!",1

Amazon initially said 5-6 days. Took around 8-9minutes for me to put it together (Comes in 2 parts basically). When I first sat down on it, was already happy knowing this is an upgrade over my race car gaming chair. The seat is thick and firm, not too firm. You'll sink into it a bit depending on your weight. I like the thickness/firm feeling because I feel like it won't bottom out as fast as a thinner pad would. The arms are adjustable completely, they aren't soft but the build quality is nice. Also, they have a resistance to them so you have to give it a push to move it inwards / outwards (Which means it's well built and sturdy). The frame is practically new, you can tell they really clean it up for you. Upon receiving you'll think it's a new chair, new fabric, cushion and more. For the back, personally I didn't like the lumbar support so I took it out, (Felt too pushy and thick, probably due to my poor posture) and the back frame already has a curve to it to give your back support. They provide a video on how to remove the lumbar support on Youtube.Overall, day one I'm very happy. I can rock in it and keep a reclined position if I'd like, and you really feel fitted to the frame and seat, basically like you aren't going anywhere and strapped in.Another good thing is the warranty, I'm not sure if they replace stuff in the future for free like the seat, but It's cool knowing they have a good support team to ship whatever you need later on.For my Height, I'm 5'9 And around 195 Pounds. The size of the frame and chair is literally a perfect fit.",1

Embody the Embody is a very well made, very comfortable chair. i'm 5'7, and if i were over 5'9 i would have kept this chair. the lumbar was too agressive and it pushed all the way up into my thoracic spine area- too high. but i do recommend that chair for non short peoplethe gesture is a little like this as well, the lumbar and ergonomics of the back are too aggressive/tallbut the leap... the leap is perfect for my 150lb/5'7 frame. here is the thing thoughcrandall will add more padding, to me it feels like both the seat AND the back have more padding, as i JUST purchased a leap - brand new from a licensed distributor in person- for my home office, and the Crandal is more comfortable due to the thicker seat padding!!!i cant recommend them enough. this chair is bad ass, and you still get a 12 year warranty for almost 50% off the price.I'm honestly considering returning my brand new leap and re-ordering this specific crandal refurb as its noticeably more comfortable!if you know you like the leap, dont hesitate to get it from crandal!

The only minor issue is that the reclining mechanism didn't work smoothly when I originally assembled it, it felt like it had several discrete settings that it slipped between.  From reading feedback on Leap v2 chairs, this seems to be a common issue with both new and remanufactured Leaps.  I removed the seat and sprayed the key parts of the mechanism with a dry silicone lubricant, and the reassembled chair now works very smoothly.",1

It's just not good for a chair in this price range. My previous chair that was priced at $150 has a better arm rest. So I spent another $25 to fix that issue but I am taking a star off.The back stiffness adjust well until you get to the mid section then you really have to push it down hard to get it to go lower which for me I needed it lower as I like it having stiffness at lower back area (I am 5'8 btw)Other than that I am actually impressed. My only if is how long will it last me compared to the large amount of money I paid for.,1

Overall great value with *actual* refurbishments from a 3rd party office furniture company.* Steelcase ships chair fully assembled and ready to go in a giant box, the Crandall chair ships in a smaller box and requires minor assembly (roughly 10-15min, casters, air cylinder, seat side panels, seat frame, seat bottom - roughly in that order). Except for the air cylinder no tools are required (a hex wrench was included for the air cylinder adjustment). The instructions look chaotic (probably because they fit everything onto a single page).* The fabric is different from my chairs (but also steelcase offers many different fabric options. Still soft.* The extra cushion in the seat is nice, I wish my steelcase had the extra cushion. This is the biggest plus for me over a standard leap.* The armrests are not as soft as the original. These are a bit firmer and have a harder surface. (could be a plus if you're into that).* I can still sit long periods of time in this chair with no back pain.",1

I did *a lot* of research, watching reviews, reading reddit opinions and the consensus was A) gaming chairs are all crap and B) the Steelcase Leap v2 is the best you can get. However brand new they are very expensive ($1500-$2k) but after reading more reviews, I kept seeing Crandall pop up again and again as a good place to get a used Leap V2Now you can can get a used leap V2 cheaper elsewhere, however the reason its worth it to spend $600 at Crandall is their warranty guarantee (12 years) and the amount of work they put into refurbishing the chair. Everything from deep cleaning, new casters, new (thicker!) seat pad, etc the chair looks like it just came off the factory floor. Putting the chair together was super easy, their instructions are very detailed (see picture), you will not see poorly-explained Ikea-esq diagrams here! They also have a customer support hotline.As for comfort, others have explained better than me, but the amount of adjustability options this chair has are amazing. Once I had everything set up, I can sit in this thing for hours and not have any back issues or discomfort. I expect this chair will last me a long, long time and highly recommend!",1

Even though I didn't go with them, you have to thank BTOD for their quality content and even letting me know that this who remastered Leap thing existed.After watching many videos and reading opinions all over the internet, I decided to go with Crandall. BTOD has a lot of reviews saying it takes a while to get the chair, and I didn't want to wait so Crandall it was! Seeing I could buy through them on Amazon, as a Prime member, was even sweeter.After purchasing, it was said I wouldn't get the chair for around 2 weeks but I came in less than one.Now to the chair. It's perfect. I haven't had it long so I can't speak to long term, but I can say that it looks brand new all around and performs amazingly with no problems. Assembly took around 10-15 minutes with everything mostly put together already.The fabric is all brand new, and you can tell the seat looks a bit more substantial than the regular Leaps in the videos due to Crandall replacing the padding.The chair itself is much heavier than it looks and it's obvious immediately that this thing is the real deal compared to the $200 cheap ones I've been using. I'm 5'8 170 with short legs and the chair is able to fit me just fine. Due to the other adjustment options, like the seat sliding, this could definitely accommodate a much larger person as well.Great chair. Great company. Very happy with my purchase.Will update if something happens or in 6 months and a year since that matters for an every day office chair.",2

I assured her, it has a 12-year warranty. 12 years means that Crandall Office really trusts itself with my spine and butt-cheeks. I reminded my mom that I was getting a degree in computer science. Either I learn to float while spending hours at my desk or get a new chair.Main Review:1. Assembly:I have sticks for arms. If you have to bring it upstairs, I recommend opening the box and taking up each part one by one.Assembly was easy until sliding the seat into the seat glides. It took more than 20 tries to get it on. Either I'd put it in and the seat glides fall out, or it doesn't click in place. Since I couldn't see where I was sliding into the seat, it was a bunch of finger-crossing and guesswork. Once the seat was in, it was all sunshine and rainbows.2.) FeelI'm incredibly short (F), 4'11"" (150cm). So I have to put the chair and armrests at maximum height in order to align myself with my desk. I have to hop on the chair to get on it. My legs dangle off the floor. I can criss-cross-apple-sauce while sitting. I don't need a headrest. All the benefits/woes of a petite person.Regardless of my ""short""comings, this chair is crazy comfortable. I was used to the abuse of my old chair. I forgot that I can sit back and relax while simultaneously typing. I can push back and the chair reclines backward along with me. I don't even know what a lumbar is, but it's being supported. I have had 0 upper back pain since the purchase of this chair.Thanks Crandall!",1

Amazon initially said 5-6 days. Took around 8-9minutes for me to put it together (Comes in 2 parts basically). When I first sat down on it, was already happy knowing this is an upgrade over my race car gaming chair. The seat is thick and firm, not too firm. You'll sink into it a bit depending on your weight. I like the thickness/firm feeling because I feel like it won't bottom out as fast as a thinner pad would. The arms are adjustable completely, they aren't soft but the build quality is nice. Also, they have a resistance to them so you have to give it a push to move it inwards / outwards (Which means it's well built and sturdy). The frame is practically new, you can tell they really clean it up for you. Upon receiving you'll think it's a new chair, new fabric, cushion and more. For the back, personally I didn't like the lumbar support so I took it out, (Felt too pushy and thick, probably due to my poor posture) and the back frame already has a curve to it to give your back support. They provide a video on how to remove the lumbar support on Youtube.Overall, day one I'm very happy. I can rock in it and keep a reclined position if I'd like, and you really feel fitted to the frame and seat, basically like you aren't going anywhere and strapped in.Another good thing is the warranty, I'm not sure if they replace stuff in the future for free like the seat, but It's cool knowing they have a good support team to ship whatever you need later on.For my Height, I'm 5'9 And around 195 Pounds. The size of the frame and chair is literally a perfect fit.",1

Leap V2 2. Gesture 3. Embody the Embody is a very well made, very comfortable chair. i'm 5'7, and if i were over 5'9 i would have kept this chair. the lumbar was too agressive and it pushed all the way up into my thoracic spine area- too high. but i do recommend that chair for non short peoplethe gesture is a little like this as well, the lumbar and ergonomics of the back are too aggressive/tallbut the leap... the leap is perfect for my 150lb/5'7 frame. here is the thing thoughcrandall will add more padding, to me it feels like both the seat AND the back have more padding, as i JUST purchased a leap - brand new from a licensed distributor in person- for my home office, and the Crandal is more comfortable due to the thicker seat padding!!!i cant recommend them enough. this chair is bad ass, and you still get a 12 year warranty for almost 50% off the price.I'm honestly considering returning my brand new leap and re-ordering this specific crandal refurb as its noticeably more comfortable!if you know you like the leap, dont hesitate to get it from crandal!

It is nearly indistinguishable from new, except the style of fabric is slightly different. There is one tiny spot of surface rust on the bottom of the seat pan, and several of the screws have very light surface rust as well. But those screws are recessed into small cylinders that are also on the seat pan. In other words, no one is ever going to see any of this. You would have to turn the chair upside down and then the imperfections are so small that you'd have to be looking for them.I bought this because I have for years had lower back pain. I'm now going to PT and seeing a couple of different doctors, and I thought I might as well get a chair that is designed to support my back. It may sound odd, but my back actually feels better after sitting in this chair than at just about any other time. This is beneficial because I know I have to get up and move a couple of times every hour and this chair makes that easy to do. I used to dread getting up to stretch and walk because my back hurt so bad when I stood up -- so I avoided it and delayed it as much as possible. Now, though, I don't worry about encountering pain when I get up, so it becomes much easier to leave my chair to exercise.All in all, I am completely happy. This is one of those times when I really wonder why anyone would spend so much more for a new chair when they can buy this one at half the price -- or even a bit less. Well, I'm glad people *do* buy the new ones because then we can buy them after they have been reconditioned.",1

It is still in excellent shape and as comfortable as the day I bought it. The cushion has not lost its form and doesn't seem to be suffering any indentation at all, and I cannot see even a single loose thread anywhere on the fabric around the seat or back. Those are the areas I'd expect to see wear the soonest, and there is still none.This chair is widely believed to be one of the best ever, and in my experience I can say it deserves every bit of that acclaim. For this price as well for a refurbished chair that is just as good as a brand new one, you cannot go wrong. This is without a doubt the best purchase I have ever made.",2

Took only about 5 minutes to install.  Plus shipping said it would take about 2 weeks or so to deliver (understandable because I think  they build these to order usually), but mine came in 3 days!  Wonderful surprise, and fantastic quality.  Seems like new.  I have these chairs at work and have sat in them before, I know what they are supposed to feel like (which is why I bought this exact brand and model - they are absolutely fantastic chairs in case you're wondering).  Not seeing (or feeling) any flaws here.  They look and feel like the ones I have at work that are brand new.  Seriously impressive job these guys are doing, and I hope they keep it up.  If you're on the fence, then let me tip you over - they deserve your business!Make sure you line up the gas cylinder head with the chair raise/lower lever switch.  It's really not hard, just line it up with the lever as you're putting the seat on.  Just gloss over the included instructions and you'll see what I mean.  But if you're like me and you breezed through the rest of the installation without looking because of how EASY it is, then do yourself a favor and read on.So if you installed the cylinder without lining it up with the lever (derp, oops), grab a pair of channel locks from somewhere, cause you'll need to grab the inner part of the cylinder (the part that makes contact with the chair) clamp at the base of that and twist + turn that to get the cylinder back out.  You won't be able to just pull it out from the seat (which is probably a good thing, so you can pick the chair up without it falling apart lol).  Hope that helps.  Oh, ALSO pay attention to the directions for the seat guides.  Again, not hard - just look at the illustration to see how they fit on and you'll get it.",2

We have some new versions of these chairs at our office and these are in way better condition and more comfortable. I do wish they would make the backpad included instead of an additional $30 OR just increase the chair cost across the board and make that the new standard, you can tell the additional padding on the seat makes a huge difference too, the bottoming out feeling you get from a new one isn't exaggerated.

Nothing was out of place, bent, broken, loose, etc., all pieces fit fine.  The increased padding is definitely noticeable so that's a welcome change.  Arm rests are 4D adjustable which is a huge step up from my Leap V1.  Long-term durability is still up in the air, but considering Crandall provides a warranty (on their own manufactured parts) I'm hoping it'll last at least a few years.",1

I thought about buying a new one, but I didn’t really want to spend all that money again on a chair. Luckily, I found Crandall Office Furniture and was able to buy an older re-manufactured chair with brand new seat pad and back cushion. I bought it with a platinum base and their steel bionet fabric, which I highly recommend if want a lighter grey chair with black accents.When I opened the box I noticed how clean and excellent the overall condition of the chair was. Initially the chair had a slight squeak towards the back and I was able to fix that with a bit of WD-40. The whole process of setting the chair up was straight forward, my only problem came when I tried to install the side activated gas cylinder. I was off just a tiny bit when I first placed it on and this led to the chair sinking when I sat in it. I was able to borrow a monkey wrench to dislodge the cylinder without damaging it and when I went to reinstall the cylinder a second time, I was more careful to properly line the clip up and lock it into place. (Crandall has videos on both how to install their cylinders and how to fix squeaks on YouTube so these are things anyone can do easily.)The biggest difference I have noticed so far between the Crandall Office Furniture re-manufactured Leap V2 and the original Steelcase Leap V2 is most definitely the cushion. The original Steelcase Leap V2 is more ergonomic out of the box. While this is good thing because it forces you to sit properly, it also means the chair seat is harder, and the overall feel of the chair is more rigid when you sit in it. The Crandall Office re-manufactured version of Leap V2 feels much more accommodating to my tushy and the lumbar support has to be raised along with the added cushioning the seat pad provides. I think overtime the chair will break-in and feel more ergonomic like the original Steelcase Leap V2.I am very happy with my purchase. I hope to buy one soon for my brother as well and have recommended this chair to several people. Here’s a funny little story: When checking the chair out for himself my dad asked me, “How much did it cost?” and when I told him he replied, “I don’t see how you can come out on that.” Then he sat in the chair and said he understood why I spent so much money on it.",1

I've been struggling with an RSI for the past year or so, and learned through physical therapy + trial and error how important a good office chair is for preventing shoulder pain.The lumbar support feels odd at first (it's very loose until you put pressure on it), but has been surprisingly easy to get used to. The seat/back are nothing special, but aren't uncomfortable either. The armrests are what make the chair really worth it, because this is one of the only chairs I can find under ~$800 with enough adjustment to comfortably support my arms when using correct ergonomic posture (most arm rests are far too wide at their narrowest setting)Perhaps more impressive was their stellar customer service. I experienced a litany of issues getting the chair shipped to me, none of which were really the fault of Haworth (the seller), but they were nonetheless very responsive and helpful in getting those issues resolved. Even with delays from the courier, the chair ended up arriving ahead of the expected delivery date.",1

J. Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","As of writing this, I've had this chair for over 60 days and have sat in it for many, many hours over that time.Before getting into it, I should note that I don't have much experience with actually nice office chairs as I've only ever personally owned the cheapy $100 chairs you can get at Office Depot and the like, so consider that I'm an office chair layman as you read this.I'm 5'10/230lbs and this chair's pretty much perfect for me. I don't have any particular physical issues so I can't speak to how this chair would do for people with any specific conditions, but the ergonomics and comfort of this chair are such that I can sit in it for hours without needing to get up, and once I do, neither my back, butt, nor legs hurt. It has good lumbar support, a fairly soft yet supportive cushion that doesn't sink into the base even after sitting in it for 6-8 hours at a time, and surprisingly adjustable armrests. It's well-built, sturdy, actually feels like it's made to last which is nice for a modern American-made product, and looks good to boot. It came fully assembled which I didn't expect and thought was awesome, but also a bit of a pain for me since I picked it up from my local UPS Store where I have a box (can't get deliveries to where I live) and my car isn't exactly the most spacious, but I managed (I should've read the description beforehand). It did have a pretty strong chemical smell for about a week after getting it. The chair went on sale right after I ordered it so I contacted Haworth customer support and they retroactively refunded me the difference without any fuss at all, which I thought was great. Overall, very pleased with the chair, and I think it's worth it even at its MSRP.I'd also like to note that before buying this, I had purchased a Branch Daily Chair without realizing that I was right at its weight limit and my butt suffered through true agony for about a month before I even thought to check on those technical details (I thought maybe my body was finally telling me I sit too much, but nope, just too fat for that chair). Again, I really need to get better about fully reading through item descriptions, ha. Hopefully that's helpful to anyone around my size wanting to save some cash by going with that chair.",1

The back material is very stiff. The chair has all the features of a much more expensive chair, such as forward tilt (extra), seat depth, lumbar support (extra), arm height, back tension, seat height and back lock. All of the adjustments work well except the lumbar height which looks to have been designed by a child. It's simply a sliding piece of plastic that is supposed to be contoured to the person's back but in reality hurts my back no matter where it is set. Luckily it is easy to remove this piece which otherwise would have rendered the chair unusable. So if you need adjustable lumber support, this is not the chair for you. Luckily, I have always liked a stiff chair. Another positive is that the chair arrives completely assembled which saves hours compared to most other chairs. Thus returning it is as easy, though quite bulky and probably expensive. I am happy with the chair.",0

I've been struggling with an RSI for the past year or so, and learned through physical therapy + trial and error how important a good office chair is for preventing shoulder pain.The lumbar support feels odd at first (it's very loose until you put pressure on it), but has been surprisingly easy to get used to. The seat/back are nothing special, but aren't uncomfortable either. The armrests are what make the chair really worth it, because this is one of the only chairs I can find under ~$800 with enough adjustment to comfortably support my arms when using correct ergonomic posture (most arm rests are far too wide at their narrowest setting)Perhaps more impressive was their stellar customer service. I experienced a litany of issues getting the chair shipped to me, none of which were really the fault of Haworth (the seller), but they were nonetheless very responsive and helpful in getting those issues resolved. Even with delays from the courier, the chair ended up arriving ahead of the expected delivery date.",1

J. Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2024","As of writing this, I've had this chair for over 60 days and have sat in it for many, many hours over that time.Before getting into it, I should note that I don't have much experience with actually nice office chairs as I've only ever personally owned the cheapy $100 chairs you can get at Office Depot and the like, so consider that I'm an office chair layman as you read this.I'm 5'10/230lbs and this chair's pretty much perfect for me. I don't have any particular physical issues so I can't speak to how this chair would do for people with any specific conditions, but the ergonomics and comfort of this chair are such that I can sit in it for hours without needing to get up, and once I do, neither my back, butt, nor legs hurt. It has good lumbar support, a fairly soft yet supportive cushion that doesn't sink into the base even after sitting in it for 6-8 hours at a time, and surprisingly adjustable armrests. It's well-built, sturdy, actually feels like it's made to last which is nice for a modern American-made product, and looks good to boot. It came fully assembled which I didn't expect and thought was awesome, but also a bit of a pain for me since I picked it up from my local UPS Store where I have a box (can't get deliveries to where I live) and my car isn't exactly the most spacious, but I managed (I should've read the description beforehand). It did have a pretty strong chemical smell for about a week after getting it. The chair went on sale right after I ordered it so I contacted Haworth customer support and they retroactively refunded me the difference without any fuss at all, which I thought was great. Overall, very pleased with the chair, and I think it's worth it even at its MSRP.I'd also like to note that before buying this, I had purchased a Branch Daily Chair without realizing that I was right at its weight limit and my butt suffered through true agony for about a month before I even thought to check on those technical details (I thought maybe my body was finally telling me I sit too much, but nope, just too fat for that chair). Again, I really need to get better about fully reading through item descriptions, ha. Hopefully that's helpful to anyone around my size wanting to save some cash by going with that chair.",1

I've bought and returned so many chairs. It is hard to find a good replacement, once you've found THE perfect chair. But I have to tell you. THIS CHAIR is good. So much so, I'm FINALLY keeping a chair. Yay and Stuff. Seat is wide enough for a heavyset person. Soft enough not to bother you after hour of sitting and the height is the best I've found. Not a lot to pick apart. Only downside was arm rests. The do not stay in place. MINOR issue for me, but I can see SOME complaining on it. That's it. Love the chair so far.",1

The fabric cushion, has threads that are weak and so they wear down quickly. This leads to fraying strands of fabric, pieces of what appear to be hair or material popping out from under the cushion with use over time.3. I wish it was a little bit wider.4.

The Soji is my 2nd Haworth Chair.I had a Very before this but left it in a storage unit when I moved across the country (big mistake)- and went back to a conventional leather executive chair- that was a big mistake.I spend a lot of time in my office chair- working, studying for grad school, and gaming.I am also prone to health complications in the chocolate starfish region as a result of sitting too long- and that is pain I wouldn’t wish upon my worst nemesis.Haworth chairs have quite literally given me my life back. I’ve never had health issues as a result of sitting in these. Yes- they are stiff at first- and this Soji is stiffer than my Very- but that is a good thing.The stiffness of the foam in these chairs allows the weight of your body to be evenly distributed without sagging- including through your thighs.The second l benefit to the stiff foam is that it will retain its shape over time. This is a piece of commercial grade furniture- it’s priced as such, too.The seating position will feel different at first, but I’ve never had health complications arise from a Haworth chair.In fact, I’ve had to buy a bigger iPhone because of all the phone numbers I get now that I have excellent posture.If you need extra lumbar support- I would recommend the Very over the Soji- that chair has a finer degree of lumbar adjustability.  The soji is going to be perfectly supportive for the average person though.I never get hot sitting in these chairs, and they perform great for a wide range of people- ranging from 6’3 me to my 5’5 mom.The build quality is certainly in line with the price. Initially, it might feel the same as as a $200 chair, but I guarantee you after a 10 hour day, the Haworth will leave you feeling miles better.Take it from someone who has done both.",1

Putting the product together is difficult especially when getting to the smaller holes, it appears that they didn't drill them properly [or even at all] you've got to take the bolt for M [the smallest one] and grind it into the top several spaces to make threads with a decent amount of force. I got frustrated with it at least 3 times and while I can tell in one glance it should have been a fairly simple, easy, and beginner level project to put together the amount of force and frustration it gave me it took me two days due to taking multiple breaks from not realizing I had to drill the holes myself by hand with the bolts.

I put these together and was pretty happy with how they looked. I didn‚Äôt expect much from pressed wood and within a month of not much use the screws have fallen out and the lid is no longer attached to the rest of the end table. Past the point of return. Ending up buying a better quality piece not made of pressed wood. The other hasn‚Äôt lost any screws, but it is in the bedroom and isn‚Äôt used vs the living room gently being used. We are not rough on our furniture, so I was really surprised and disappointed that all of the screws have fallen out of the hinges.

As soon as I saw 2 part packs maked "j" and saw I only needed one I should have known to double check...but no, I had to wait until the 8 "m" screws were called for. üòê Now I have to go to Home Depot and buy screws.No big deal you say...WRONG. I should be sitting here enjoying my new end table, not hating that I have to go to Home Depot.P.S. I've got 2 of your side tables in my cart...I'll be putting those back. ‚úå‚ù§&üö´üî©P.P.S. The product is actually nice looking and seems to be sturdy. I hate I don't trust getting your end tables now.

These tables are awesome, easy to assemble, and great for the price!Why I rated only one star?  Because we ordered the grey and received the black tables!  We bought the two pack of grey tables, received the black without notification from the seller.  They took down the picture of the two grey tables.  Why didn‚Äôt the seller contact us to give us the choice?‚Ä¶.We kept the black tables, but it would‚Äôve been nice if the seller had reached out, cancelled the order, or gave us the choice to wait for the grey color.  I don‚Äôt appreciate not getting what I paid for!!!

It's a pretty stable side table and assembly was easy, but every couple of hours it's like it sheds little brown specks. When I put stuff on the table, I can hear what sounds like sand underneath the object. I'll wipe down the table and clean it, then 3 hours later, it's covered in the little specks of wood finish again. I'm hoping it will stop happening, but it's been almost 2 weeks and I've cleaned it 6 times. (Update) The furniture came, infested with termites...I now have termites in my living room.

USB charging port doesn‚Äôt work, no problem it happens and I‚Äôll just return it. Only problem, they make you box it yourself and the UPS store charges $15 for the box. Seems crazy to me that I purchased, put the thing together, drove it to where I want it, deal with it not working, drive it home and process the return, drive it to the UPS store, and then they want me to pay the $15 for the box. Wasn‚Äôt my fault it didn‚Äôt work, seems like the company should pay for the box‚Ä¶..

Received the items and noticed that the manufacturer drilled in some screws too much on the top of the table that it made the wood rise and crack. There resolution was to pay me $15 per table instead of actually providing me with a good product.

I have had this table less than a year and the outlets stopped working.  I tried contacting the manufacturer hoping they would send just a new power strip, but no answer.  Frustrated.

Amazon told me to contact the seller because the item is guaranteed for 30 days and I received a defective item. I submitted photos to the seller three times and have never received a response. So I'm left with a side table with parts that do not fit together.Update: I eventually received a response that this was not sufficient to warrant a refund/return. So I'm left with one defective side table.

This product took hours to assemble.  The holes did not line up.  The tools that came with the product were cheap and bent when I was using them.  I ended up having to use super glue and glue pieces together.  Do not buy this product.

Amazon sent the wrong color and will not refund. I cannot return because my husband put them together without my checking them first. I offered to take them to Kohl‚Äôs assembled but customer service representative dropped my chat. I offered to send photos! The tables are a nice slender fit and great function but ugly color. I guess I‚Äôll paint them. Check the color before you assemble! Lesson learned!

Holes didn‚Äôt line up, I had to drill my own. Besides that it‚Äôs ok but I was expecting bigger (this is my bad for not checking the dimensions) The instructions weren‚Äôt wrong, but there were key parts (some things go a specific way) that would have been nice to know up front. I had to assemble, find out it was right and take it apart and redo it

This looks like it would be lovely I'm sure, but it's totally worthless! It came with absolutely no hardware or the tools to put it together. Now I have to figure out how to put this all back in the very small complexly packed box to ship it back for a full replacement because they can't just send the hardware. What a nightmare.

In the picture they have this thing sitting next to a couch going to the level of the armrest of the couch‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre a mini person‚Ä¶ So while this thing is cool‚Ä¶ It is very small. I should‚Äôve read the dimensions but when I saw that picture, it was obviously extremely deceptive!

I really wanted to love the table but after a few months the charging port (usb‚Äôs & outlet inside the table) doesnt work at all now!! It‚Äôs sad because it makes the features of the table useless now

This item looked good online but when i got it, it was way too small.

Hardware mismarked so number of items that should have been included was wrong.  Worst thing ever.  But since I tried to improvise I cannot even return it.  Totally disgusting

Complete waste of time trying to assemble. The part E is big and even with loosely assembled screws, I couldn‚Äôt put them together. They are off a notch when it comes to part E and D‚Äôs. The bottom shelf.

The table looked nice but I was missing pieces and when I contacted customer service they connected me with the manufacturer that insisted I wasn‚Äôt missing pieces, I finally needed up returning it for a refund

This was easy to assemble and is visually appealing. Unfortunately, after three months it will no longer charge anything. Now it‚Äôs just an overpriced table..

The table‚Äôs screws are of very poor quality and strip easily when using the enclosed Phillips head screw driver. I had to go to Lowe‚Äôs to buy replace the screws with a higher quality screw.

Holes not fully drilled and screws are cheep and not self tapping

Threw this piece of junk in the trash!! None of the pieces matched up and was a huge waste of time and money!!

This product was hard to put together. It is not very sturdy. It is not worth the money! When I was putting this together the fake wood split.

This was missing pieces. And no one would follow up with me to get the pieces I was missing to fix it. Otherwise it would be great

The holes on the last piece are incorrectly placed so I can‚Äôt screw in the last piece. This is just garbage.

Received mine with the hole not drilled in the correct places. A waste.

11 step instructions with over 70 pieces for a small end table. Building the Taj Mahal would have been easier.

Top shelf broke at time of installation

It missed two holes!!!!!

Pictures are extremely inaccurate of size. Photos were either edited or taken next to miniature couches. This table is extremely small.

I really wish the legs of the table fit with the rest of the construction -

My fault....I overlooked the demintions. Just to tiny.

Impossible instructions, missing parts

A piece was missing from my item

Bought because I liked the light rustic look. It‚Äôs actually a very dark brown :(

The picture makes it look WAY bigger than it is! Unhappy by size but very easy to assemble!

Parts did not fit, pre drilled holes were off

Horrible product

More like childrens furniture

Cheaply made

Terrible

THE FRAME WORK FOR THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS NOT MADE CORRECTLY - ON ONE OF THE FRAMES TO HOLD THE WOOD - THE HOLE WAS DRILLED IN THE WRONG PLACE SO IT CANNOT BE ASSEMBLED CORRECTLY OR AT ALL - MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS GOING TO SHAVE THE END OF PIECE "E" SO IT WILL FIT PROPERLY BECAUSE IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO PACKAGE IT UP & SEND IT BACK - GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR BUT NOT SURPRISED SO JUST BEWARE WHEN ORDERING IT MAY NOT COME DRILLED IN THE RIGHT PLACE SO ALL OTHER PARTS WILL NOT FIT AT ALL IN PLACE THE WAY IT SHOULD SO REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT FOR SURE

It was not worth the money! Really  pretty but  It‚Äôs made out of particle board. None of the holes lined up which just made the next steps even harder to assemble it. Spend your money somewhere else.

Gave it away

My other unit i bought was fine.  This was cancelled but never was.  I to call amazon direct and complain.

Update - one of the table‚Äôs electrical connection goes in and out.  The top-level lid is inconvenient because you have to move everything on top of the table to get anything out of the storage ‚Äúdrawer‚Äù.Original- Perfect for what we need - organization for our stuff (too much of it) and devices by our couch.  We both work remotely and often work from the living room while we take a break from our home office.  We were tired of the mess of cords everywhere along with other items.  These solve the problem!  They are sleek, space saving, and have a nice, rustic decor.  Assembly was pretty straightforward.

the holes don't align, had to drill my own to assemble. if you are going to buy cheap MDF, just go to Ikea at least its more reputable. No more furniture purchases from amazon!

Haven't had very long. I have 3 of these and on all 3 the edges on top are starting to bubble and the glue used on the veneer is not holding. I have recieved a refund for 1 of these tables but i purchased an order of 2 and an order of 1. All three of these tables are flawed in the same way. I expected a refund for all 3 tables not just 1.

Had to drill our own holes into shelf C and shelf B was missing. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend

This is now my go-to end table.  It came well packaged with clear instructions, and I was able to put 1 together in about half an hour. We love having both usb's and sockets inside the table so they're not an eyesore, and there's plenty of space on the shelves for anything we need to keep at hand. I just wish it came with guides to lead the power cord to the back of the table so it didn't hang in the way.

It is tree perfect height and easy to assemble. It is sturdy and has a convenient storage area. I love the ability to charge my electronics and plug in my heating pad. Having 2 extra shelves is wonderful.

If you have a small space these are great becasue not only for there size but also that you have 2 extra outlets and some outlet to charge your phones or tablets. And they're nice looking also. They are easy to put together and fast.

This is a fairly sturdy side table. I say fairly because not all of the holes for the very small screws were pre-drilled deep enough so the top is a little shaky because I couldn't get the screws in flush with the wood (see video). You could use a cordless screwdriver, which I don't have, but the space to work in is very tight so that might not work. If you have issues with strength in your hands or arms, putting this together might be an issue and you may need help.Cons:As mentioned above, not all holes were pre-drilled properly.I was missing 4 bolts that were unlike any other bolts needed, and had to go get them from the store. They also require a different Allen wrench than included (you will need 2 different Allen wrenches) so I could only finger tighten those bolts. I did, as one other reviewer mentioned, have 1 of the type of bolts in the spare parts bag.I was missing 4 other different type bolts, and they were to bolt in the electrical outlet. Since it's a drop in slot, I wasn't concerned about them and had already been to the store once.The directions were only mildly confusing and some of it was trial and error as to which piece goes which way. This is why you never fully tightern screws and bolts until later.Pros:This really is sturdy,  even with missing parts.Overall, it was easy to assemble though it took my about an hour with some of that trial and error.The instructions included the size of the bolts and screws needed, so you can take it with you to get the appropriate parts, if needed.They actually include a magnetic screwdriver in the packaging for parts, which was nice, though I have screwdrivers.Overall thoughts:All in all, I would buy one again but would check for all parts prior to starting to put it together.I may contact the manufacturer and order the bolts needed for the electrical outlet, or go get them myself, as that will likely be quicker and they won't cost much.I gave it 4 stars only because of the multiple missing parts and not having the pre-drilled holes drilled deep enough (probably 4 of the 8 were of the correct depth).It's a cute table that functions well for the areas between my couch and window that won't take up space.

These are great and they come with a real screwdriver as well even though I just used a drill for most everything but it was nice to have a little screwdriver gift also to check tightness and stuff. Nice wood and nice hinges

This is probably the best adult purchase I‚Äôve made! I was easy to put together! Good sized and the plug and usb ports work extremely well!! Good purchase for a office, bachelor pads or a college dorm!

I needed the shelving to store some books and was happy everything fit nicely. The flip top and chargers are a great bonus and it's the perfect little side table thats stylish without being imposing.

I have this near my bed next to my nightstand and works really well for me. IT seems to be made very good.

This is so perfect for rv living with small narrow areas. Love it!

Love this little side table. Pretty easy to assemble. Directions were easy to follow and all pieces were in the box. Got this to go next my recliner. Definitely needed the USB ports. So perfect for the items I need close at hand. Hubby thought this was unnecessary until he saw it. I should've bought the two pack.

I had to make a couple modifications! Holes did not line up for screws. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. This is way over priced!!

They look great and were easy to assemble. However, I bought two and the USB ports in both stopped working as soon as the return window passed!

Very disappointed at the quality and challenges with putting it together.  Would not recommend.

It‚Äôs cute and does what I need it to do, but I didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention to the height. Was expecting something taller.

I could have given a better review but not all parts fit correctly. I do not recommend this product.

The pieces don‚Äôt align at all. It can‚Äôt even be properly assembled because the holes in the side piece are literally half an inch further than the rest of the unit.

Disappointed with the quality and craftmenship

I loved the table and it worked for 5 months. Now it won‚Äôt charge my phone. The plug in works but USB ports do not work. Yes I‚Äôve tried everything. They don‚Äôt work. Disappointed.

Pay attention to measurements!!! Like kid furniture size but ill use it a a side table vs TV stand

The one board was too long so we had to take off 1/2 inch from one end.It is sturdy and a nice piece once modified

USB charger broke.

Help me put this complicated thing together. I would pay someone

Not the size or quality I thought it would be.  Looks cheap.  Slightly disappointed, but I‚Äôll keep it for now.

Not wide enough to be stable

Too small

I originally bought this table because I wanted a small end table  for my new bedroom. When I found that this one had the ability to actually charge my iphone at night as well? I was extremely happy.It arrived, had all the parts and it seemed easy enough to put together by myself. That was my first mistake: I honestly thought that this was a one-man job. It's a four man job, with power tools and a sense of despair, a mental break down and the ability to isolate and piss off your entire family. And STILL NOT GET THE JOB DONE. I want to make it known as well, I am not new to building. In one week, I built three beds, a TV stand, 2 gamer desks, a gaming chair and two shelving units... I KNOW how to build things... But this little, tiny table took me out.To begin, there are pieces that were too big to fit together. Part E is WAY too big and it makes it impossible for part D to fit on the end of the table (This is what the three photos above show) I had to take off both of the D parts, screw one back in, and then screw the other one at the very end... But its hanging off the end. The table is LOPSIDED.In order for all of the pieces to be connected to part E, which is the problem here... I had to drill a brand new hole in the end of the piece, create a makeshift connection, and then GLUE IT together. Then, came the part of taking part A and connecting it to parts B and C. It seems like the manufacturers didn't drill holes big enough to actually support the screws to get this job done. So again, out came the power drill to get this piece completed.I have never been so frustrated with a table in my entire life. It is a 3 pound table. It is half the size of a normal, standard sized end table. The thing doesn't even have drawers... Just two shelves... and the thing is a monster to put together.Don't waste the money. Its not worth your time. And if you did waste the money before seeing this review... Good luck, I understand your frustration, and I am here in spirit for you.

The top bar is a good one. The bar on the bottom is not good, Because screw nut not sitting inside the bar properly. I wasted a lot of time and still can not put a screw in it. I feel so frustrated.

It is kinda small but the big issue is the location of the outlets and the space in between the outlets. I couldn‚Äôt plug 2 adapters for USB C chargers in it and it does not have USB C at all. Had to buy a power bar for the inside of the table. It seems over priced for the quality.

Had a hard time putting togetherNot a great end resultToo small for the space I wanted so it sits in cupboard as a storage unit

I have had this table for just under 4 months and the USB ports are no longer functioning on a consistent basis.  For example, when used with my IPhone or iPad it will constantly make the sound that it is being plugged in to power throughout the night.  Some nights there is no charge at all.  I have tried this with multiple devices and multiple power cords.Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to contact anyone to see if the plug can be replaced.  And now it is past the return window.That aside, the table was pretty easy to be assembled.  It is quite sturdy and looks good.

Way smaller than I anticipated

The table is fine but one of the reasons I bought it was so I would have an out of the way table where I could change my devices.  The USB ports worked for a week or two then no longer would charge.  Not happy at all.Mike

On of the tables are broken

I would‚Äôve given this table a 5 star as it was great while it lasted. We love being able to charge our baby monitors while on the couch- however all of a sudden , the two USB ports stopped working. We can use the plugs but nowadays you get more usb cords and is what we used. Disappointed.

The hole for the outlet to go through was too small for the outlet so I had to sand and file it bigger to make it fit, and now my living room is covered in sawdust.

Triple check dimensions as it is very small and low. It‚Äôs overpriced for what you get. Rickety when assembled and pieces inside sealed box arrived scratched.

Initial impression was that the instructions and packaging were very good. However, half way through assembly, I discovered that one of the parts did not have the screwholes drilled so was unable to complete the assembly. I reached out to the supplier for a replacement part but 48 hours later have had no response.

If you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones, you‚Äôll get a table without missing hardware, without misaligned holes or no holes. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll get one with missing holes and misaligned holes. In two places the holes are drilled for larger screw when instructions say smaller screws are to be used. So I can‚Äôt even fix it myself.Buy it if you‚Äôre feeling brave and want to take your chances.

It was delivered early and my young grandchildren helped me put it together. It‚Äôs exactly as advertised and very sturdy. Sadly though, the phone charger was broken when I received it and am not able to plug my phone in and charge it which was the reason I got it. Still using it as it‚Äôs not worth the trouble to take it apart and send it back.

USB don‚Äôt work. Tried 4 different cords. BAD

these tables are too small

In person it looks a lot cheaper and fake (wood) then in the ad. The part that opens up is in the wrong spot for depending on whech end of the sofa it is.

This table was easy to put together and fit perfectly into the space that we had.. The only issue we have with it is the power outlets stopped working after 2 weeks. If you're purchasing just as a table it's great if you're purchasing for the power outlet as well  look elsewhere.

This was the worst piece of furniture I have ever put together. You can‚Äôt screw all the screws in tight because the pieces won‚Äôt fit properly. You have to loosen some and tighten others. I will never buy this brand again. Now that it‚Äôs built it‚Äôs sturdy and useful but wow bit a happy camper!

Nice quality material and very easy to put together however because of two mis drilled holes in ‚ÄúD‚Äù pieces, the whole thing is crocked and screws cannot be screwed in all the way as per pictures sttavhed. . What a big disappointment!

It just seems cheap, which I guess it is, but I've bought cheaper sturdier furniture from ikea

Table looks as the picture, however 3 types of screws 2 differnt Alan wrenches and one screwdriver . Time consuming to put together. Also, the picture shows two tables for the price but when you order it, it just says one quantity so I thought it meant like one set. Nope , One table. It is a nice table, but for the price of one table I could‚Äôve bought it already put together. I‚Äôll probably keep it, but I don‚Äôt know yet. And the outlet they have you put towards the front of the table which would dangle the cord in front of the table.

I liked the tables but the holes of the top were off center

They were represented as a bigger and larger table than received

The media could not be loaded.
                



Makes for more room in living room.  However power cord runs from the front of table and feels awkward  for lamp placement. Have to lift lamp to access storage compartment if would reverse position, inconvenient.

So, this is actually a great product. BUT it is a bit misleading. The price mark and the photos show it to be a solid wood build. The price I paid would match this, so it was incorrectly assumed that it would be solid wood. It is particle board with a wood veneer.Is this a great little shelf? YES!Is this what I expected in size? Also yes.To be fair this is not mentioned as a solid wood, but neither does it say MDF or particle board. So sure, but this for your needs, but expect to pay $80 for a $30 shelf. It looks great, functions perfectly.This hits every mark, EXCEPT the expectation for solid wood.

I‚Äôd say you get what you pay for but the ‚Äúwood‚Äù (I know it‚Äôs particle board) is super cheap and thin. This product is ‚Äújust okay‚Äù. My advice is either spend less and get the same quality or spend the extra money to get a better quality product. Again, it‚Äôs just okay. I‚Äôm keeping it because it‚Äôs not worth the hassle to disassemble and repackage.The instructions were okay but had to take it apart a few times because the instructions weren‚Äôt clear enough. All pieces were there and the screw holes aligned which is a nice

Wish the 1/2 that opened slid under the solid section. Be more user friendly.

It is so unnecessary that I end up assembling all of this type of cheap furniture together backwards. TELL ME WHAT THIS MEANS IF I SHOULD BE DOING IT. A picture calling out two holes at the top means put these at the top. I had them at the top, but now the pieces don‚Äôt fit together. Little did I know because it wasn‚Äôt labeled, this actually was indicating the direction the legs should be facing, as it won‚Äôt work if assembled the other direction.Great product, I just hate it now because bad instructions make me hate whatever product I have just assembled.Is it too much to ask to have normalpeople assemble and if the instructions don‚Äôt make sense, update them?

These end tables are great for a small space and are very sturdy but the outlets are in the worst location and in less than a year, the usb inlets have busted and the outlet has stopped worked in one. So frustrating.

Height was ok. But the depth was half than expected. Use to store my medicine and to charge my watch and phone.

Like the color, nice wood, however, the top shelf with the outlet did not fit in the space between the two end pieces. it seems the space is to narrow, not sure if we did something wrong or a flaw in production.

Decent unit time will tell as to durability. If I didn‚Äôt have the other unit with the thicker parts I probably would have given this unit 4 or 5. My fault I did not look closer. Otherwise I would recommend the unit. It definitely serves it‚Äôs purpose

It‚Äôs very very small!  So if you think a tall or somewhat tall charging table is coming- it‚Äôs not! It doesn‚Äôt fit much ‚Ä¶. For almost $100 you would think you‚Äôre getting Somewhat of above table- but you‚Äôre not

Ok as far as sturdiness, easy to put together, not the color I thought it would be- darker and much more brown than the picture so it doesn‚Äôt really match like I would like it to.

It's fine but missing the right screws made it difficult and a hassle

I like the table for small spaces. The chargers inside the table suck. My phone was dead when I plugged it in and it took 7 hours to get to 44%. That was part of the reason I bought the table. I should have just bought a different one without USB ports and plug ins.

I don't see myself keeping it for long but this side table fills the need for now; darker finish than pictured which I'm fine with. Giving three stars due to some "unfinished" wood pieces and the outlet design flaw lol--  As you can see from my pictures, some plugs will limit your usage. The outlet is actually screwed into the slot, so hopefully the company can offer a new version to drop in.

I‚Äôm not gonna knock the company for this table. It is a good quality table. But, the table is made for a child! As you can see by my picture the thing stands about a foot tall! All the pictures that they have posted are very misleading. It is way too small for me!

This product is MUCH smaller than it looks.  Not tall and not long.  I will make it work, because it was not easy to put together so I am not taking it apart now.  Instructions were great.  Pieces very well labeled and separated.

If you put it together backwards, assembly is much easier

I will not order this again  it is all put together  so I will  keep it make it work

I love this table, pretty sturdy. But, when assembling I noticed a few of the pre drilled holes were not drilled right, when I was tightening the screws a few of the holes were drilled too big for the screws, so the screws spun like they were stripped. Other than that it is a beautiful side table.

Nice table but missing holes to install the pieces.

Good height for side of couch,

Okay they look great but what I don't like is half open the other half is screwed down so you have to reach back under neath the lid.thats my only complaint

Had to return bc one piece of the stand was wrong length otherwise I think I would have liked it. What I was able to put together was sturdy

This table does not even go up to my chair arm, it is much smaller than what I was wanting. But oh well, get what you pay for.

Very small size, make sure to check the measurements . also the instructions are not clear, kind a tricky

It‚Äôs a nice end table but it very small and did not fit with my large chairs!

The assembly instructions were not very clear on where to put two critical pieces due to the fact the instructions were pictures only. The screws were easily stripped out to.

This is super cute, but having a lift top is terribly impractical. You have to keep moving things. Wanted it for a bedside table as it could hide cords. Still kept it, as it's really cute.

This was excellent in putting it together.  However it is a little smaller than I had expected.

More narrow than I expected

Instructions are horrible

I'm loving thisnend table, i boughtntwo of them for my living room. However, one of my packages was missing one of the pieces to assemble the drawer, specifically piece number 11.

Great table for small spots. About six months after getting it we started having issue with the power supply and not even a full year later there‚Äôs no power to the table at all. All we tried to do was charge our phones while sitting it at so it wasn‚Äôt even used 24/7.

My boyfriend ordered this for me and had it sent to my new house. While I absolutely love the design and the outlets inside, I am highly disappointed that this thing is particle board! I'm sorry but for the $95 he paid for it I would expect this to be real wood. It is super cute and useful but I do not think it is worth the money. I can see myself replacing with real wood at some point.

I hope this can be remedied

I bought this as a charging area for my office. It literally comes up to my knee. It seems well built and works for charging my phones but ‚Ä¶ did I mention it‚Äôs little?

The slot where the electric box goes was crooked had to cut it out more.

WAS NOT EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.  SAYS 30 MINUTES, IT TOOK 1HOUR 3O MINUTES FOR THE FIRST ONE.  THE SECOND ONE THE TOP PIECE WITH HINGES WAS NOT PRE DRILLED.  I HAD TO MEASURE BOTH SIDES AND END, THEN PRE DRILL HOLES.  THE SCREWS WERE SOFT AND HAD A TENDENCY TO ROUND OUT.  DUE NOT USE ANY POWER DRILL.  THIS MATERIAL IS VERY HARD, THE SCREWS DID NOT GO IN EASY.  THE PRE DRILLED HOLES WERE VERY SHALLOW WHEN THEY WERE THERE.

This is a sturdy little unit, I love that it has hydro in it, the only draw back was that it was missing the screws that hold the power box  in, didn‚Äôt want to return it after most of the assembly was done, so now I will have to go to a hardware store to finish it.

It was easy to put together, but realized I only received one outlet for one of the two end tables. I'm trying to get in touch with the company. To let em know.

I ordered 3.  1 works perfect.  2 the plugins don‚Äôt work.  Have emailed customer service.  Can easily be 5 stars, they are awesome tables, if the plugs work.

Nice tables with two AC power plugs and two USB plugs. USB plugs are useless for any fast charging device. Will not charge my pixel 6a or my iPad 10th property and have to use USC C plug with fast charging capacity to charge properly.

This one is nice a bit smaller than what u see in the picture and it looks very tiny in my dinning room where i originally wanted it, but I  made it work . I do still like it a lot, just wish it was bigger that‚Äôs all.

So these aren‚Äôt great. First they don‚Äôt have the same pattern to them as shown in the Photos, it‚Äôs a picture glued on press board. Second they aren‚Äôt visually the same size as shown. My bad I didn‚Äôt measure before ordering. That‚Äôs on me. But they are pretty solid and they are ok for the price considering what end tables cost in stores now.

I‚Äôve spent hours trying to get this table together but found metal in Stella don‚Äôt match the holes in the wood. I now have to drill through Stella to make holes that match. Not well thought out and quality control not  very good.  Very disappointing , this is where we are at just have to drill holes .

These tables are pretty great. They fit in the space that I got them for, they look like exactly as shown and were fairly easy to assemble.That being said, the tables I received did not come with an instruction Manuel (goes to show that assembly is easy) and also one of the tables is missing one of the plug sockets as shown in my picture.I have contacted the customer service that Amazon has posted on this product, which leads me directly to the rolanstar support. They have no idea what product I am referring to and I have been fighting for over a week now trying to figure out how to obtain this missing piece and it is still looking like there is no resolution in my near future.I am incredibly disappointed that no one is helping me resolve this issue.

This is a very handy table.  This issue with this is what is wrong with most directions that are unclear and just pictures. I had to remove and reattach some pieces more than once. It is still not right but I just couldn‚Äôt take it apart again.

I bought this to replace an Ikea Kallax shelf that was doing double duty as storage and sofa end table. My partner liked mine so much we bought a second one almost immediately to replace his end table too.This table is the perfect height for our sofa. We were worried it would be unstable because it's narrow but it doesn't wobble at all (if you have small children you'll want to secure it though!) The extra bit of storage inside the table top is nice, but I forget about it sometimes lol.Our living room looks a lot nicer with these matching end tables, and it opens up space in the room too. Only tip is wait for a sale and get the 2 piece matching set; buying them individually costs more.We don't use the plug/chargers so can't speak to how well those work, but it is a nice idea.

I have bought 3 of these tables recently and have no issues at all. As I was putting the last one together as you see pictured above the screw holes were way off from where they needed to be. Very hard to complete the process.

I love these tables my only complaint is that the holes on the frame were drilled wrong on one of mine and I had to make a new hole where it was suppose to be. Other then that they are amazing and just the right size.

Having upped the size of our bed from full to California King, we didn't have much room for bedside tables. We needed something narrow, with storage. We also wanted something sturdy of course. These fit the bill. Only complaints are with assembly. The starter holes could have been better, some of the screws went in crooked or simply didn't want to start. The alphabetized stickers on the wood are of course helpful for reference but why do manufacturers use material that doesn't come off easily and leaves a sticky, glue residue on the wood? Also the order of assembly spelled out in the directions is a but awkward. They are sturdy with a few hidden sticky spots and a few screws that didn't seat flat. Overall I'm satisfied, it is "build your own". I just think the company could make a few improvements in production and process.

Pretty sturdy, came with extra hardware, pay attention to details in instructions, when assembling!

The instructions were not that clear. The electric outlets were facing a different direction than the picture showed on your website.

We used these as end tables next to the couch in a very small living room. They are perfect size and color. These are great for charging the electronics while in the hidden top to keep it looking tidy.

We have it in our TV room next to a reclining chair and all of our technology gadgets are plugged intothe fold back top and out of sight.

This so far is amazing and works great for our apartment we needed somewhere to set up and hide the wires for our modem and router so our cat can‚Äôt get at the wires and this works amazing. For the most part is was really easy to set up, but there was only one really difficult part when putting on the top. You have screw in the pieces to a pre drilled spot but it isn‚Äôt drilled in all the way only partial so I really had to force this screw into the wood myself and if you don‚Äôt have power tools like me this sucked with only a screw driver. I eventually got it in but stripped the screw a little bit and made the process much longer, but everything else was very easy though and the final product is great.

It came packaged extremely well. As others have stated, directions are pictures only. Make sure not to tighten any screws until the very end, no matter how badly you want to. Also pay attention to the tiny pictures of where the holes are on the rails. I‚Äôd you mess that up you have to take it apart and start over.Overall a good table.Complaints:You cannot choose which side you want the outlet to be.There is only one side of the table w the small cutout for cords. Would be nice if this was on both sides so others could use it.The pre-drilled holes for the L brackets are garbage. These need to be drilled more so you can fully tighten the tiny screws that go here.

Instructions were clear and easy to follow. The order of assembly was logical and straight-forward.

Great little tables that are very east to assemble.  Took maybe an hour for both, easy directions, just be careful as the legs go only in one direction or the top pieces do not align correctly.  Only one complaint overall.  The package purchased in=s a matching set.  And they do in fact match right down to which side the cord slot is cut into.  This means that when placing on either side of the sofa, the cords are hidden by the sofa one side but exposed on the other.  One table can be turned around as the front and rear face are identical, but this then shortens the main power cord.  A minor inconvenience but could be fixed in the next iteration.

The only assembly problem I had was the directions are not really clear on the positioning of the center holes on the top of the sides.  Be sure they are facing to the outside.  I had to remove one of the sides and re-assemble.  It's sturdy and looks great with 2 storage shelves.  I wish there was a hook or other type of fastener to attach the cord to before plugging it in.  I used a zip tie to tie the cord under the upper shelf unit to hide the power code.  I would purchase this again.  Oh and the allen head screws are a PITA.  I would rather have phillips heads so I could use an electric screwdriver.

I got these tables to go at the end of my sectional couch. I liked the idea of charging and having plugs. The directions were a bit confusing, one of the brackets went the opposite way of how the directions. The lift up storage is handy as well as the 2 shelves. Within a few days of putting together, one of the usb ports would not work. I reached out to the company and they immediately sent out a replacement. The usb ports are a slow charge but work. Overall a decent table.

Liked that it is small as expected. Color a little bold. Only complaints are they are identical, No Left and Right. Plug is mounted inside both on same side, I was hoping they not same. overall I like them

It would be nice if there was a stop on the part of the table that swings. As it is you need to hold it up or clear everything off so it rests flat to be able to look through the insideThe finish is VERY slippy. A little bump and things go sliding everywhere.The plug unit is in the corner and makes it difficult to plug certain things in.But it holds all my nail tools in one area and does what I wanted it to

This is smaller than I expected. Even measuring out the space before hand didn't prepare me for it's smaller size.The one thing I really wish I could change is that the top opens on the part that has the plug. Which means that the end with the plug is the farthest from the wall since the hing opens in the middle. This makes the cord have to stretch across the length of the table to get to the back to the outlet. I wish that they would have taken a bit longer to redesign that portion. For now, I'm using command hooks to keep the cord tucked in under the top so it's not visible.

little shorter than I thought it would be

I read a lot of reviews that simply said to watch where the holes were on top, do yourself a favor and make sure they're always closest to the outside. Really look at that book and see where they are! I have no idea why everyone else was so vague about that. The directions are clear, all the tools and hardware were there, it was packed properly for shipping, I think in the furniture world, this is a successful buy and is worth it's price. Feels pretty sturdy and is exactly what I wanted beside my bed. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the effort involved with assembly.

Good size. Would put together top of table sooner. Hard to screw the screws in upside down

Bought this for next to our nursing chair. Haven‚Äôt used it yet, but looks just as pictured. Gave it 4 of 5 stars because I wish it allowed for flexible top on both sides, also I don‚Äôt like that you can see the brackets so easily on the top half that doesn‚Äôt fold up and that is doesn‚Äôt have a power cord entry on both sides (so all cords for charging in the drawer come out the front in order for the plug for the wall to be closer). Overall sturdy, need a little muscle to get nails in the holes (some holes weren‚Äôt really drilled prior), but happy with purchase.

One screw that attaches the electric outlet to the table didn't fit., Otherwise a great looking little table.

It fit my space well. I needed something to use next to my recliner.

This item fits our small area very well. It has a nice rustic look with the black frame contrasting the wood look. I gave it a 4 stars overall because the tools provided for asswmbly were flimsy. The instructions are OK, but could be a bit clearer as to the location of the assembly holes. I ended up using my own tools and it came together in about 45 minutes..

I love these little tables...but.  If only the slot for your cords to stick out was located on each side & end.  You are forced to modify the assembly and ignore the holes unless you place the table on the left side of your furniture.  This also leaves the plug-in located at the back of the unit where it doesn't open - not the most convenient.  Once assembled, you can't see the cut-out, so they should just make one on each corner for universal location.

So far product seems fine and will hopefully work great as a side table; although the screw broke off at the screw head so I couldn't assemble it as instructed.  I think it will hold anyway but beware.  Not sure if I got a bad screw (as the others were fine, albeit I was a little more cautious with the rest) or if they are just cheap.

Only one side of the tabletop is curved out to allow cords to pass out of the charging station under the lift up top.  it would be better if the tabletop was made so cords can be utilized out of both sides. Also has a regular socket for plugs but if the plug has depth (like a computer outlet plug) it may not allow the flip top to close properly.

I absolutely love these tables! Perfect for small side tables and small spaces.  Assembly was my only complaint. The image in one part of the direction does not communicate well that its misinformed. But primarily when it says do not tighten screws aka leave loose....it really means barely screw it at all. LOL

I like the outlet that comes in it. It was a bit difficult to get together as some of the holes had not been pre- drilled properly.

Pretty sturdy little table and small enough for small places for sure. Surprisingly easy to assemble too. Only downfall is you can't choose which way to place the table top in order for it to flip up the direction you want(in my case to face the best way toward the outlet). Otherwise, nice little table. Was packed really well for shipping too.

Super fast and easy to put together. Definitely sturdy enough for anything you'd want to place on/in it. one complaint I have is that the door slams down. I do wish it had maybe a tighter hinge. I had to add some cabinet door stopper dots to both sides of moving piece to absorb some of the slam

Now that it is built it is a nice side table in my office but the instructions were not helpful and a piece of wood ended up breaking off in the process of trying to build it. Make sure to keep the screws really loose until the end or the top shelf area won‚Äôt really fit

This is a nice end table easy to assemble. I bought two one was had the hinges put on the wrong side so had to drill new holes for the top cover. Other than that it is a great end table.

It‚Äôs ok, sturdy but little smaller than expected it‚Äôs still worth the price

Having a arthritis problem using an allen wrench doesn't help with all the small screws!!  But $90 willbuy enough pain libations to ease the pain and boost the sympathy of the little Mrs's!!!!

I‚Äôm stuck on step 5 because the holes were not drilled enough on any of the pieces. So that‚Äôs cool. Can‚Äôt assemble 2 tables if I can‚Äôt fully build them with the tools provided.

I like the size. I am using for a end table.

A nice inexpensive little table. Decent quality - the table is sturdy and the storage area and electrical/USB outlets are a plus.  Assembly was tedious on the first one, however the 2nd one was much easier.

Table is nice, but the plug element stopped working within weeks.  But the company did send a full refund.

I got this for a space in my woodworking shop. I am very pleased at this both for size and value.Obviously not amish made but functional and I am happy with my purchases

Love this end table . The only thing about this table that buyers need to know about before they purchase.  Is if you use a fast charging cable to charge with the outlet that this table comes with can not support.. other then that . I love this . We will be changing out the out let on our . We are very disappointed with that problem.

Nice for the small area I have. Had to un assemble and reassemble because directions were not clear as to space needed for part of the bottom.

Sturdy enough to hold my coffee in the morning and beer(s) during the game.

This table is sturdy and convenient for a small space.  The charging station is a huge plus.  I put this beside my husband's recliner in our den.  The table is a bit darker then the picture depicts, though.

It comes with two Allen wrenches and a small Philips. It's packaged really well with Styrofoam and card board. It took me about 30 min to put it together

I wish the plug was in not in the location it is

A little hard to get together but I am pretty good with that stuff.  Love the size and amount of storage.

The end table was a good choice for our space.

I love these tables and the price was right! I am using one next to my couch where I have my laptop and being able to stash the charging cord inside is great. No more tripping on the cord! I use the other table as a nightstand and again, charging cords for my AirPods and iPhone go inside. My cats love to mess with things on my nightstand so this helps with that‚Äîno more searching for my glasses on the floor in the morning. I highly recommend these tables.

Just right size for my small room

Just what I needed. Love them

These are a bit low since they are end tables but they work well for us as entry tables by the doors. We can charge things inside them without everything being on display and I love the shelves for tucking our shoes away on

It took me Lu get to put together than I expected but I am pleased with the size and look. One of the tables seems to have a loose hinge but not a deal breaker. I wanted smaller tables for the bedroom and this size is perfect.

We love everything about our tables. We bought 1. Later bought 2 more to match the 1st, so all our grandchildren had places to charge their devices.  And the colors are great with our decor. Very strong for a self assemble unit.

Needed a new bed side table to replace and older one that was to wide to fit between my bed and desk. This Fit PERFECTLY like I'm talking within the set space of an inch or so.  Plus the thing comes with an outlet for to usb and plugins !? Now I don't have to drape my charging cables across my desk to reach the bed! Also doubles as a storage bin with the 2 shelves. Putting it together was actually really easy (since i suck at putting things together that's a big deal) had only a slight problem on a screw but just used a power tool and it was done!

great material, love how sturdy they are, worth the money

Small,functional and electric outlet makes it so much more useful... high quality too

I initially had some issues with the holes lining up and ability to put screws in all of the way.  Also received a faulty outlet.  Company was very quick to respond and is sending out a new unit and I don't have to return the old one; which would have been a hassle since it was mostly put together.Otherwise, I really liked the color and functionality of the table and so glad that I'll be able to use it.

Once assembled correctly these tables are sturdy and very useful with their interior plugs and USB charging plugs.  I will caution buyers however that the assembly directions are neither clear nor complete.  At first glance they appear simple.  However several pieces can be assembled backwards without even knowing it, nor recognizing it from the directions.  I have assembled four of these tables and consider myself pretty good at it, but I still had to go back several steps on the last one before successful assemble.  Nice tables, very stable, just be careful.

They are very easy to put together. They work very well and look amazing.

One of the best put it together pieces of furniture I ever purchased. Parts marked, easy to follow directions, holes lined up perfectly.

I love these little stands. I placed them on each side of my living room couch. I also bought a 3rd one made the same except it had 2 draws in the bottom for next to my recliner. These stands were easy to assemble, they are well made, built sturdy. The charging station is handy and all work well.

I have two of these and love 'em! A/C ports and USB Ports makes these not just beautiful but very, very functional.

This was the little side table that I was looking for. I am doing some upgrades in my home and am replacing all the side tables in the living room. I saw it and right away ordered it and worried about the assembly but it was not a thing to be concerned about. As I took inventory of all the parts I thought I was missing a sack of needed screws. I reported it and as soon as I got back to the living room I found that little sack. My face was red because I had not been as careful as I should have been. Much to my surprise the Rolanstar company had responded to me. That is great customer service but I had to admit the error was mine and not theirs. I went about assembling the table and it turned out great. Even though I am not very handy it is exactly what it should be. The directions were clear and concise. I am very proud to now have this side table right next to everyone's favorite seat - the recliner. Just perfect. Thanks for the prompt delivery, response and most of all great product.

I needed a narrow coffee table for my living room & really liked the idea of being able to plug in my phone a little closer to me when on the couch.  I ended up buying the 2 pack to have a matching pair.I was worried about it arriving damaged, but it was well wrapped.  It was easy to put together.  I did test all the outlets before assembly.These look good in my living room.  They are simple and my couch over powers them anyways so they're not a focal point.  I like being able to tuck remotes away.  I just wish that the side where the cord goes through was interchangeable.Overall, I am happy & I can use them elsewhere if I ever get a nice set for my living room.

These tables are very sturdy and look nice!

It has everything in one from space to charging station to stack in multiple things (books, legos, toys)

just as advertised. perfect for small area  A++++++

I read the reviews on this table so, when I received it I felt prepared to assemble it. Well was I wrong üòë about that. The previous reviews kept saying be careful of the ‚Äúhole alignment‚Äù. I was looking and trying to be very careful. Let me try and shed some light in the mysterious ‚Äúholes‚Äù. What I found was that the end pieces need to be faced a certain direction OR the top piece doesn‚Äôt fit. My suggestion (for what it‚Äôs worth) is to put the small ‚ÄúD‚Äù labeled pieces on the top of the end rails first. This way you can see the side that has room for the top shelf to fit into. Than the rest of the assembly is easy. Other than that this piece is a dream. It‚Äôs narrow and long so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big unit. So, for my purpose it‚Äôs perfect. It fits my lamp and has room left over to put my other stuff on and the 2 USB with 2 plugs is a great  bonus! This is sturdy and easy to assemble if you pay attention.

Super simple and I recognized that this was planned and put together with someone like me in mind!I don‚Äôt like putting things together cause I got traumatized by other products that I encountered: unfit bolts, wrong sides, etc.this product did it differently: no wrong sides! All of them has holes on both sides.The only in match sides is the parts that made the sides of the drawer part. Even then, it was super easy to recognized.The onlyProblem that I have is when I had to secure the corner braces. The pre made whole weren‚Äôt too deep and I had to screw them in manually. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to screwed them in.Thank you for making this amazing product!My husband now has a side table to help assist him for his post-op recovery from his surgery.

Well built sturdy nice product just what I needed for my small living room

I bought two of these as side tables for our sofa. They hold a standard size table lamp really well and the hinged compartments are nice for storage. They seem fairly sturdy and were easy to put together. The brown and black industrial type look is very warm and attractive. The only thing I would change is that the small cutout for the wires to pass through for using the electrical outlet and the USB ports are only on one side so if you put the tables on either side of the sofa, one would face the person sitting there and the other one is on the outside of the table causing that person to reach awkwardly for it. I would have placed cutouts on both sides to allow for the choice of the buyer. Also, I would reverse the way the electrical outlets are arranged so that the "ground" plug is situated away from the USB ports. Depending on what you plug in there, the "ground" plug causes the USB ports to be covered with the adapter. Other than that, I love these tables.

I've looked & looked for a table to put next to my recliner.  Visited my daughter, and she had this one.  Fell in love with it.  It is sturdy, has shelves to put things on and 2 3-prong plug-ins & 2 USB ports.  Now I can charge my iPad, iPhone & Fitbit in one spot.  Love it!!!  My husband decided he wanted one after seeing mine so I ordered one for him...he loves his too.

It was scary to get assembly furniture due to so many bad products out there. What a breath of fresh air. This one Rocks. Use good tools to speed the construction. Solid and nice looking. It was perfect. Thanks Amazon. Amazing Amazon.... You Rock!

Pretty easy to assembly if you pay attention. Love the charging station. It fits in with my living room. I ordered an additional one for the other side of the couch. Having two shelves is handy. I wish that both sides of the end table were hinged. Only one side flips. That‚Äôs the only thing I would change.

Nice addition

Easy to assemble -- 30 minute, give or take a few. All tools necessary are supplied. Even comes with a few extra screws if needed.HOWEVER -- requires a fair amount of hand strength to tighten screws. I could easily tighten the screws, but my wife is mid-seventies and not as strong as she was when younger. Although she could have used a power drill with appropriate Allen wrench bits if I was not available to tighten them down.

As described, fast shipping

This end table was very well packaged to prevent damage during shipping.  The instructions are very easy with just one thing to pay special attention to - make sure the metal pieces holes are on the outside perimeter when assembling.  I caught it early on and took one piece apart (could be I sometimes need bifocals and couldn't tell their position lol)It looks great, charging station works properly and I find this piece to be extremely sturdy.  The height fits perfect to the arm of my sofa.  I'm using it to aid in my work at home station (no room for a desk). 8.5x11" baskets fit perfectly on the bottom shelves as well.The color says dark gray but I find it a mix of browner tones than dark gray, but I am keeping it because it's a neutral color and such a nice sturdy piece.

These were a great buy. They look even better in person. I put both together in under an hour with no issue. This company is rare, they even sent the tools needed & a bag of extra parts just in case. Seriously, a bag of hardware marked ‚Äúspare‚Äù. Great idea & little seen from todays companies. I was impressed & would not hesitate to recommend or purchase again myself.

Just what we needed. Easy to assemble, but watch the orientation of the holes. They're sturdy and look great.

I don't often leave reviews because I think it's a chore but I had to for these two tables I received yesterday and put together. Only thing I have to say on assembly process is pay attention at the diagrams and hole directions closely... I failed to and had to take extra 5 minutes to disassemble part of one and assemble correctly.Anyway... These tables are super awesome to help control electronics chaos that often ends up piled in 7 different locations in my house. Now there are two locations for storage and charging as well as neatly tucked away cables.I love organization and these little tables give me that right next to where I sit on the couch.Super highly recommend these!Great size, sturdy, appealing...andAwesome price!

These tables came packaged quite well.The assembly was easy and the directions were clear and precise. They even included spare hardware.I highly recommend these tables. They are quite sturdy.

Arrived as described

Easy to put together and solidly made

Great for a living room side table ! Plenty of room inside the table too! Color is exact match !

It took me a little longer than I thought to put it together, but the end product was great... The instruction are mostly picture instruction... so look at them closely to get all the holes facing the right way... or you will have to take it apart and switch it to the correct direction (look for the little circled areas showing hole directions). Also, they warn you to not tighten unit hardware until  almost the end of the directions.... this makes it easier to line up all the holes (sometime you have to have the boards somewhat loose to make those holes line up...but they did line up for me...). This is not a large unit and is a little pricy for its size, but it's everything I wanted to hold my remotes, iPhone charger, etc. right by where I sit to watch TV. I would purchase this item again.

I can‚Äôt say how much I am pleased with this product for many reasons. I love how everything you need to put it together is included. From the Philips screwdriver to the Allen wrenches we‚Äôre all there, even a pkg marked ‚Äúextras‚Äù just in case you lose a screw or two.  The instructions were so easy to follow and the finished product was awesome! I liked the fact that you could hold a lot in the drawers which I keep my datebook and Bible study books.Of course the added bonus was the outlet for charging your media items is hidden in the drawer.  Highly recommended!

The product works as described. However, this is my second unit delivered and both have been busted to some degree. The first one had a support leg cracked and the second one has a corner busted. The first was replaced. The second one,  they offered me $30 dollars. I explained that this cannot be repaired. It's particle wood. Since the entire thing was already put together, could you just send me the table top. In thier email, they claim that they do not have this item in stock and and they couldn't send this one piece because it's too long! So you sent me a new entire table the first time but you cannot send me the table top the second time? They raised their moneyback to $50 dollars but that's not going to help with particle wood as I stated earlier. As a side note, the table looks and operates just fine but the corners are sharp! It's all particle wood with a veneer wrapped around it. Which is the reason it cannot be repaired. You can't hardly fix bent or damaged veneer without having some more on hand.

I was so excited about this table. I spent about two hours building it only to get to the last part.. screwing in the Hinge The entire thing completely comes out‚Ä¶.. So now the table is useless, and I guess I have to take the whole thing apart to return it‚Ä¶.? Save  yourself a Headache

Holes were over drilled for the dowels and female cam- lock fittings. They easily fall out at the most in-opertune moment. Absolutely stay away from this garbage.

Looks good in photos, but actual product is very flimsy.Bought it for the size and when assembled the lift arm base was very uneven.  I have had many lift tops and this was way below expectations.  I saw similar products selling elsewhere for half price, but decided to buy on Amazon, as I trusted Amazon's reputation.This product is a total disappointment.  Not sure why amazon keeps letting these types of vendors onto their platform....

Cheap flimsy fake materials. Everything starts cracking and splitting way too much. Came with no instructions in the box. Exactly what you‚Äôd expect trying to save a dollar using Amazon. Just don‚Äôt.

Buyer beware cheap junk plastic over pressed particle color not espresso does not resemble wood

Cheap quality, zero customer service, lax delivery ethics.

Poor Poor quality import stuff! what ever happened to solid wood furniture that would outlast generations. DO NOT BUY THIS! STAY AWAY FROM CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP particleboards that strips out. Directions that hAVE 2 DOZEN WORDS TO EXPLAIN WITH GOOFY PICTURES. mY UNIT IS MISSING PARTS AS aMAZON DIDN'T DOUBLEBOX IT. pIECES BROKEN SCUFFED AND THE LIKE.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FURNITURE FROM AMAZON.!

Very cheap materials. The particle board split where you put the screws and dowels. And not as big as the pictures show. Will be out $127 dollars!!!

This was a terrible table. It took three hours to assemble. The box arrived and weighed about 100 pounds and lugging it up several flights of stairs was not fun in the apartment my daughter lives in.Once assembled, it looked fantastic, but was rickety to the point where it was dangerous. We tightened everything up, but nothing helped. When the table was extended, it was so rickety that we were scared it would fall if something was placed on top of it we ended up disassembling and boxing it back up, returning it to Amazon.It looks great, but is not worth the money at all

I received this table as a replacement for my living room table, hoping it would be a better one, and it was not. The quality of the table was cheap, and even when everything was tight would rock.  The item also was missing pieces that I had to end up returning the whole item after I was just about finished putting it together.  The process was a pain.

I haven‚Äôt even assembled the table yet. I open the box and soon realize the whole cardboard box is covered in fiberglass which has now gotten onto my hands and living room floor. No warning or anything. I had my cats around it and everything. I am so frustrated and upset.

I bought this coffee table and while my handyman was assembling the table it chipped several spots. Now it is half made and I paid $95 to my handyman. Not sure what to do with this item. I am old and single lady cannot take it back to amazon or ups. Please advise the action forward. Even if they take ot back, i paid 95 dollars for assembly and now I will have to pay again

Ok, firstly I never write reviews, good or bad products. This product is an exception for likely the Worst piece of unassembled furniture I have ever tried to assemble. I have done many many.  Please save yourself hours of trying to assemble this then the time to pack it back into the box and then time to go to UPS store.  Run, not walk from this Rolandland product.  I knew this was bad when a standard Phillips screw driver head would not fit into the twist lock. Cheap looking veneer, very chippy corners. I want the 3 hrs of my life back I wasted.

I bought this table most of the parts were missingAmazon would not ship the missing parts

The top is so cheap you have to use two hands to pick it up or it can twist. The corner protectors fell off after 10 minutes. When I put the top down I noticed the whole top was warped in a u shape. Maybe would have been worth $85 at most.

Extremely cheaply made, the wood dowels broke through the veneer on 2 sides of the table. The lift action is very poor, unbalanced, unstable, and much worse when closing. The lift springs are nowhere nearly strong enough to feel like the top is supported correctly. If I could return this, I would in a heartbeat. Awful! üò°üò°üò°

We‚Äôve put together many pieces of furniture from a desk, TV stand, bookcase, but this was really cheep.  The laminate is very thin, applying pressure on the dowels caused it to fracture.  It‚Äôs a nice design, but beware of breakage.  Very disappointed in the purchase.

So I was so stocked to get my package than I see that it was damaged upon delivery!!!! I saw the instructions and it‚Äôs the bottom part! So if the assembly is decent and nothing else is damaged than I will change the rating!!! Until then 1 star. We all work hard for our money and if we buy something new we expect the product to be in good shape!!!! That‚Äôs what we pay for!!! I‚Äôve never written a bad review and this is my 1st one! üò¢

I ordered this thinking the hinge mechanism would be spring loaded like described and it had shocks which I was purposely avoiding. Not as described.

Spend the money on a higher quality table and save yourself the frustration and disappointment. The wooden pegs on this table didn‚Äôt go all the way in and when connecting the other big pieces, they pushed through the particle wood‚Ä¶.. this is not worth it and to ship this back is a hassle so money wasted I guess. Moral of the story, Pay for quality.

This item is pressed wood and a peg went through the drawer front during assembly. Wrote the company's site. They answered quickly. But could not send a drawer face..the pressed wood is easily damaged and a replacement piece will not be available once this happens to you!

The table does not open well unless you pull both sides at the same time and when you push it down if its not on both sides it springs back. Hit my kid in the face. Do not recommend it looks cheap for this price. Unsatisfied

It‚Äôs leaning against my bookshelf in all the pieces it came in. The instructions are so ridiculous I can‚Äôt put it together. I knew it was cheap but got it because it was useable.

After 1 year & 4 months it fell apart. I would think the arms would break, but it was the drawers that broke. I will not be buying this kind again.

I‚Äôm good at putting things together . But some of the wood toggles run close to the veneer and when pushed together it breaks the thin Vanderbilt. So now I have a brand new table that has 2 broken circles facing the room. Gonna have to find a different one now. What a waste

The end piece of the coffee table came damaged. This build requires lots of glue‚Ä¶. Didn‚Äôt notice till we put 75% of it together. There‚Äôs no way of taking it apart have no idea how to fix this. There‚Äôs no way I can ship a whole damn coffee table back. Anyone know the return refund policy? Would love just a new end piece. The wood color is nice atleast. ü•¥ The shipping box was fine and undamaged also.

My order was placed on Dec 4, 2021 but arrived on Jan 14, 2022. The box was totally destroyed, someone was using a lot of tape to keep box together but it didn't help. The table was damaged but because there was no box the item was not returned. So I paid almost 200.00 for damaged table, very unhappy with this purchase.

I was so disappointed in the quality of the faux wood. The pieces are held together with wood pegs that make splits in the particle board when put together.

This is the second China based company that offers the PLOY to replace parts as a warranty. Table is heavy and awkward and the hinges are so unstable they warn you in assembly instructions to grasp both sides at all times. It is time Amazon puts an effort out to source and manufacture in Mexico, lower labor costs and better workmanship. And they are right next door , easier shipping! Less polluting.

I was disappointed with the delivery as it came damaged. i sent it back and the second one was damaged too. I contacted the manufacturer for the part that was damaged, but they could not send one. They did give me some compensation money back, but it didn't fix the damage.

The screws were all flimsy, ended up having a paper weight and the table is not set up and I just want my money back. I would return it but to take this ikea table apart is impossible since the screws are so weak and basically have a one time use so don‚Äôt make a mistake or they‚Äôre stuck.

One of the wood pins punched right through the side during construction. I highly doubt this table will last long. Will have to replace it soon because the damage is noticeable and ugly. Shame since it‚Äôs brand new.

It had a big spot where laminate was popped off when we opened the box was greatly disappointed but had to keep the table bc we had house guest coming. Appears the glue or something was buckled causing it to pop off? Not sure why but again was disappointing

I disliked the fact that my coffee table is lostü§¨ second time I‚Äôve ordered and the items were supposedly LOST. I can see why the small item possibly got lost but the Coffee table as large as it was got lost!  !  Very disappointed!

Took over 2 hours to assemble unless your a carpenter don‚Äôt buy

This product was a disappointment. It took 3 hours and then we finally gave up trying to assemble it. Specifically, there‚Äôs no directions for one side of the assembly so you have to get creative on how to keep the thing together. Would not recommend it.

Wish I had spent more money on a better lift top coffee table. This thing is not going to last very long at all.

Hauled this up 3 stories just to find out it isn‚Äôt just a random box it‚Äôs in fact the child kitchen rather than the coffee table I thought I was receiving. If it was the coffee table that woulda been fine, I just wanted the coffee table

Was hard to assemble..looks like everything was thrown in the box.

All MDF material.  The package came destroyed and pieces missing.  Returned and would not buy it again even if in perfect condition.

Table broke into pieces in less than a month. I would avoid this one

I understand it‚Äôs a inexpensive item but it is such junk. If it wasn‚Äôt more of a pain in the ass to take it all apart id return it. And the directions are horrible and I‚Äôve worked with tools all my adult life.

I know everything is made in China, but give me a break. This thing is such a piece of junk that I sent it back.

I didn't realize that this needs to be assembled. The quality is terrible, so cheap. Buy elsewhere.

Was supposed to be grey it isn't grey

Opened box,. Broken board.  Sad. Took a little longer than I expected to get it. A little on the cheaper side to me.

The top wobbles when lifted and is very cheap. The color is oak, not expresso. Would not buy it again. The pieces do not align properly when putting it together.

Just had this table for four months in the face of the drawer already fell off

While strong, it is missing metal pieces that you screw #11 screws into in FOUR places.  The top will not close properly as designed in the directions.  Impossible to assemble with what arrived in the box.

Very flimsy, not sturdy and in picture it looks solid but it‚Äôs not.its not hard to assemble it is cheap in pricing and it‚Äôs cheap to look at. Not happy with the purchase but can‚Äôt return it as it‚Äôs too much hassle to take it all out.

One of the boards that hold the table was busted where you screw it in. Luckily my husband was patient and glued the board together. At the same time, he glued all the screw boards and sides together because it's so cheaply made. He put L-brackets on it too. It took an extra day to let all the glue dry before he could put it together. It's finally together and should hold together real good now with all the extra work my husband had to do. They need to recommend that you glue all the boards as well as screwing them. I would not buy this again.

I bet this was intentional like so many other defects and problematic items I get via Amazon!I sent them an email and got a response at night with the assembly instructions manual in a PDF format!It took me about 3 hours to assemble the table using the manual.Still I would not recommend a company that doesn't make their manuals available online.

The product functions,  but the lift of the table is very 'clunky' and uneven.  I dont recommend for anyone looking to regularly shift configuration.

So the product does what it's supposed to, but it feels pretty underwhelming in terms of build quality and reliability. It's on-par with what I'd expect for cheap college dorm room or walmart quality.- the lack of a crossbar is a big detractor. If you don't lift exactly in the middle, it flops and bends all over.- the drawers clack and stick when you pull them out. Something in the metal racks isn't lining up right.-the tabletop doesn't come out very far. I've seen other models with better reach.- I don't trust this to hold very much weight. It feels very wobbly and flimsy.- it slams down pretty hard when closed. There's so dampening from the springs.-directions weren't too hard to follow, but were obviously translated from another language.I wish I had gone with a more solid sturdy model in the $300-$400 range like what I saw in-person at a department store.

Everything was going fine until we realized parts I and J are manufactured incorrectly. In multiple other posts, and manufacturer videos it shows the spring connecting and at the base of the part. It seems ours is connecting the pieces too high up - if that makes sense. Would love this product if I had the correct parts.

It took me more than 3 hours to put this table together. When you lift top of the table it doesn‚Äôt open evenly and the whole table moves. So, you get what you pay for!

Be more specific on what materials it‚Äôs made of example it‚Äôs made of ‚Äúcomposite wood‚Äù not hard wood fragile (will break if not careful)!!!!

It's in a million pieces and there's NO WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS!!This is a nightmare.

It is a very nice table, but with that said I think that the lifting mechanism needs to be redone. When opening it's not sturdy at all. Update: I have now had this table for about three months. The lifting mechanism is horrible and very wobbly. Two hands are definitely needed to lift. Also the corner protectors do not stay on. The corners do need bumpers especially if you have little ones or not, trust me! So because of these issues I removed two stars.

Hubby got it put together in a couple hours.  It's really cheap materials. Not sturdy.  I wouldn't recommend if you have kids. The top is sketchy, and the drawers are a step up from poster board. So kids might not be able to be gentle enough with this. The veneer came a little bit scratched. Overall, I probably won't use it where I intended it to go in the living room.  I'll hide it in the family room and hope for the best.

The table itself is sturdy I believe and good quality. But there was no manual or catalogs in the box! I had to guess how to assemble it by trial and error, for 3-4 hours! I contacted the costumer service asked for a pdf, never heard back though!no manuals in YouTube or google. It made me exhausted and I was planning to use it for my guests, but wasn't able to assemble it for my house warming! There is a part on the front of the table that is damaged as well.

It was like an IKEA nightmare to put together. Glue, screws, everything. Took at least a couple hours.

After using this coffee table desk I immediately realized the table top being flimsy (only while extended to the upright desk position) while typing on the laptop. So as a desk i say it is ok, it should be more sturdy. i feel like this should on ly be $150-$175. This is a great coffee table though. Enjoy.

Very nice looking EXCEPT it scratches so so easy‚Ä¶had a cardboard box that weighed less than 30 pounds, slid it across the table and ended up with this huge huge scratch!!!! From the lightest Amazon box ever!!!! Amazon boxes ruining Amazon products now‚Ä¶.very upset the box was so light

The table itself looks nice but the lift top is very flimsy. It wobbles all over the place when you lift it. Would not buy again, or recommend it.

Easy to assemble, but the left up shelf is not sturdy when lifting up .. Not worth what was paid..

scratched cover

The bottom piece for one of the drawers has a pretty good crack on it. Returned and ordered replacement, will update review when I receive.

Cheap material not durable and very thin

Time consuming assembly.  Cheap material.  Lower than expected.  Fake wood  flawed lop.

The veneer is so thin that it broke in four seperate places during assembly. On top of that, the veneer wasn't trimmed flush on the edges. I really expected more from this. I'm not mad, just disappointed.

It looks like plastic wood. The lift bars are very cheap. The table top wobbles when you lift it. I don't think they will last more than a year.

I wouldn't suggest buying the espresso color it is nowhere near the color in the picture.

The directions could be better

I like everithyng ,but it came with no manual, I assembled it in 3 hours, ...

looks great but have not had it long for the overlay to start peeling on the legs I just don't think its worth what I paid

Flimsy

Looked cheap when put together

I love it

The coffee table arrived undamaged and its packaging. Upon opening it I saw a couple of superficial scratches. But more importantly it is packaged in fiberglass. There are shiny fiberglass shards all over it. This stuff will infect your house it will cause you to itch you can breathe it in. There is no reason that it should be packed like this.

I have installed the table and decided after few days you put back my old wooden table as this table looks very cheap

It‚Äôs made using 1/2‚Äù Low-grade MDF. The predrilled hole locations and fasteners and locknuts are not lining up properly resulting in chipping the boards. This thing is going back.I give it two stars for on time shipment.üòá

Little cheep made so noisy and beside one screw was broken inside wood I am stock on it very cheap

unlike a desk (same color) that we bought this week from Amazon that is rolanstar, It was same material but different company rolanstar/ Its hard to send something like this back and the price was good so we will put up with it. It looks okay but don't expect it will stay together forever if its loaded and you move it around for vacuuming.

The hinge system for the top is very flimsy and cheep

The lift top hinges can snap like a twig

I was so excited about ordering this table but really disappointed with the product. The pieces are basically the sturdiness of cardboard and damage occurred during assembly from the inserting the wooden dowels into their appropriate holes. Assembly also took about three hours and the instructions were not always clear.

Does not line up for the lift top to the bottom of the coffee table.It‚Äôs good quality though

Table is good but one of the drawer sliders that came attached from the factory was incorrect. A part meant for the left was installed upside down on the right, so the drawer is on the angle you see in the picture.

It's okay. Cheap looking for sure. It's convenient that the top pulls up but it's crazy wobbly and not sturdy at all. I wouldn't put more than 2 plates on it while it's up. Ours came with a damaged bottom deck.

Quality seems fine although I haven‚Äôt assembled the table at the time of writing this review. Table has not been assembled as only 3 of 4 table legs arrived in the package. I have escalated to Amazon who has in turn escalated to Rolanstar. Will adjust review based on how long it takes to receive missing part.Missing 1 of 2 ‚ÄúE‚Äù legs

This product is presswood. The top is warped. It was like putting ikea furniture together. Ok for the price except the warp. The description was inadequate. I would think twice before buying.

The quality isn't there. For the money I spent I expected something better. It's barely a step above Ikea, but for twice as much money. The cool lift top doesn't really redeem it.

Lots of small pieces and not great quality for the price. I would not recommend.

I bought this coffee table, assembling was ok , but Look what happened when I put them together, and I can not even remove that wooden part. The material is so bad that the wooden part made the surface cracked easily.

Was not color in pictures. But was very easy to put together.Seemed sturdy at 1st...then after a week, started to wobble. Need to tighten screws every so often so keep wrenches in table. Also came 2 days later than promised.

Not sure where the D part goes, chipped on the top edge, took 2 hours to put it together

Very hard to assemble. They say 30 minutes; expect about 2+ hours.

It's cheaply made,  hard to put together because some of the instructions are wrong answer unclear on which way the pieces go.

I put this together all by myself. I would say it would of been nice to have someone help assemble the very top of the table with the hinges but i managed.The most important thing to know about this table is that the hinges are completely separate. they do not operate together.This needs some type of support bar going across so the hinges lift insync.The hinges are also springs so they arent super strong.The table its self was nice and would of been worth the money had it come with the correct hardware.I am too scared to put anything on the top of the table as i wont be able to lift the top and if i am able to it will probably open crooked and make everything on the table fall off.very dissappointed

Seriously, it took us all day to get this thing assembled. We had such a hard time getting the legs started at first, I had already started the process through Amazon to return it because I thought it was faulty. We finally figured it out though, but that wasn't even the hardest part! I normally don't have issues with furniture that needs assembled, but this was pretty time consuming and overall ridiculous. This product also costs too much money for something that is really cheaply made. It's particle board and the decorative "rustic" look is already peeling off of one of the legs. Not to mention, a piece of the board busted off when we were putting it together, so I have to get some wood glue to put it back on, because after all the trouble we went through today, I am not going to take it apart just to return it only to have it replaced with something else that will do the same thing. The price would be okay if it was already assembled and you could pick it up from a store or something, but it's just too much for too much hassle. I'm providing an image of what it looks like in my living room. It doesn't look bad, but I had a similar table before this that was way easier to put together and was a lot stronger and it was less than $100. I wish I had kept it now, but you live and learn, I guess.

This is replacing our old one. Love the drawers. Takes a few hours to put together and at times two people are needed. THE TOP IS REALLY WOBBLY. One of the hydraulics is tighter than the other. Definitely not the quality as our old one.

Cheap material and build not sturdy. It looks as advertised but I was hoping for something thicker and sturdier. After seeing it put together my first thought was that product quality everywhere has plummeted all around.  This is what you get for this expensive price. Disappointing quality but it‚Äôs still in the living room being used.

Êó†Ê≥ïÂä†ËΩΩÂ™í‰Ωì„ÄÇ
                



The table when assembled (lots of parts) looks nice overall but the mechanism to lift the top is pretty flimsy and uneven unless lifting with two hands. Base of table inside and drawers is also very thin so won‚Äôt hold much weight. Parts of assembly really require a power drill unless you want blisters on your hand trying to get the screws in.

Help. The top of the table won‚Äôt sit squarely no matter what I do. Can someone provide some advice or help?

When we received it it already had some damage that looks like it was repaired or colored over before it was sent to us. Be very careful when putting it together. It‚Äôs not super easy and very time consuming. One thing the instructions do not say is when putting the wooden dowels in, make sure to put them in all the way on one side otherwise when you go to tap down another side onto it, it pushes through the other side. Never have I ever had a product do this before. My husband and myself have put together many furniture pieces and have never once seen this happen. See pictures. So disappointed. We spent so much money on this table too. See pictures. There is no way of hiding this either. Very very disappointed.

The assembly is quite straight forward and provided you have a screw driver and some time on your hands, this is no different than any ikea furniture set you'd buy.My issue, and from the sounds of it, every other review that isn't a 5 star, is that Rolanstar's quality control for their product is quite poor.  Some have had whole pieces missing while others have had bits and pieces not be included.  I myself received a set of hinges that won't properly close all the way and from the images, you can see that the hinges won't even close all the way on their own, creating quite a large gap when the table is in the closed position.If you do get one of the lucky boxes without any issues, I'd imagine this is quite a nice table. Otherwise, I wish you luck in dealing with their customer service.

Damage found on the item upon opening box to put together. I was hoping it would be on interior or hidden spaces and some of them were. Still about 4 knocks on the table. It was so excited for it to arrive and love the table. But it would be a pain to take apart and try to send back. Or replace just the parts that are knicked  and half to take apart all of the table. Honestly the only disappointing thing but it was a big thing for me. Found on for sale on Facebook with same damage but cheaper should have taken it. Loved the concept of the table.

First off, it did take a while to assemble, but the instructions were rather easy.  The lifting table part, however, wobbles, and is not easy to lift up 1 handed, you need to grab both ends and lift, or it will twist a bit coming up.The quality just isn't there, as I have a few seemingly permanent marks on the top and edges from just having a cardboard box on top of it.  The edges of the top have white markings from where I had my leg on it.  I'm having to find a wide table runner for this coffee table because I'm afraid of it getting more damaged.

This fit my space perfectly. It was easy to put together and its actually pretty sturdy and  well made until you get to the lift top.  Thats why I gave it 3 stars. The lift arms are not very sturdy at all. They are flimsy and you have to be careful when lifting or putting the top down. I had a lift top before this and I could pull and push with one hand and it would move smoothly. This one doesn't. It goes crooked, one side down while the other side is still up. You have to use both hands so the mechanism doesn't bend or the wood will snap which will happen if it keeps going down crooked. If this had sturdier lift arms this would be an amazing table. But it works for now.

Bought this table to match my new fireplace it was a perfect match and a gorgeous table went together pretty quick BUT the slide is terrible you must grab the middle and it tries to punch you so be warned to keep your hands ready to stop it so with that you can‚Äôt keep anything on top if you don‚Äôt want the items launched off it if you grab a side it comes out crooked. Going to be taking my old pull top hardware off the walmart $30 table that is much more heavy duty and installing that instead.

I bought this to replace an older, similar table that had started coming apart and had become wobbly and unsafe. The first thing I noticed is that the color is almost almond rather than the gray you see in the product listing. This is unfortunate because that color matched the grays already in the room.This table also has similar jointing to the old one but I added wood glue to the edge faces when putting it together hoping to provide more strength than just the locknuts and glued dowels. If that doesn‚Äôt help, looks like I will be dropping epoxy into the locknuts as well. Be prepared to periodically tighten these if you don‚Äôt take a little extra time to make sure everything will stay tight during assembly.

It looks nice and I think I'll like it, but an oversized dowel pierced through the finish and now it's ruined visually. Have to figure out how to not make it so obvious since it's the first thing seen in my home. Kind of ruined the whole experience, but otherwise it seems nice. Just be careful and if a dowel seems too big, assume it is.

Size: 41.7 Inches | Color: EspressoThis is as simple and plain of a table as you can find anywhere. No embellishments or ornamentation whatsoever. Which is what I was looking for.HOWEVER, the color is totally and completely off. I ordered the Espresso color, which to me meant it would be a dark brown? NOT. It is a light brown, more like a caf√© latte instead of an espresso. I would say this is a light oak color.So unfortunately, it absolutely doesn't match my home at all.

It's okay but I hoped it would of been a bit less cheap looking. It is functional. There is nothing wrong with the drawers and the storage will be nice when hiding my wife's junk. The package looked beat up but there was no damage to the table itself which is good.  I'm a bargain hunter and shop on Amazon often. I would say this is over priced for what you get.

I liked the color, the drawers but the springs seem to be to weak for the weight of the top table.

From that country that we know makes suspect goods. The wooden dowels punched through the fake wood plastic veneer. Because the drilled hole depth was off.

Lots of assembly, but all the parts were there. It's heavy, particle board with a thin skin or veneer that scratches easily. Cover the top with a mat, to protect from scratches. Pieces fit fairly well together. Will see how long it lasts.

Took about 2 hours to put together and had to get creative to put on the top piece alone. Seems decent but has a few imperfections if you look closely. Materials were covered in dust and what I think were tiny strands of plastic. I liked that they gave you a mini screwdriver with an actual handle.

The product looks fine but when you look at the instructions it tells you to put the wooden dowel rods in the hole with a drop of glue. The dowel rods almost entirely got into the hole, so you have to keep them out a little. But if you have them out too far, like halfway as I did, it will shatter through the wood paneling and absolutely ruin the appearance. Now, this might be my fault because I was being cautious, but make sure to put the rods in all the wag before gluing in hard.

This is exactly what I was looking for. A table with extra storage.But the instructions were very vague. It took me several hours to figure out how to put it together

a lot of pieces to build the directions are as simple as they can be. overall it looks nice and is pretty good quality. the only thing is the sturdiness when lifting the top of the table. seems like it is very delicate.  you have to lift the top slowly w two hands.

The rising system is a little awkward. Does not move together seems a little flimsy. But is actually working out pretty well. Not sure how long it will last. But for now it‚Äôs doing the job.

One of the legs arrived completely smashed into itself. It does not render the table useless but is not nice to look at. The work it would have taken to send it back wasn't worth it but we were given a partial refund. Other than that it's a nice enough table and does what it is supposed to.

We use this for our game night table in the living room.  A little heavier than i expected.  Item is easy to assemble and a good size for space saving needs.  I worry about the lift top, even assembled properly, it is quite unsturdy and can easily twist.  You have to take care when lifting and releasing it to make sure it goes down all the way.  Otherwise nice item for the price and my needs.

It was a lot smaller than we had thought it would be and for the $$$. Quality isn‚Äôt there as far I am concerned but it does the job not sure how long it will last.

This table was in my price range, and I guess you get what you pay for. I wasn‚Äôt happy with the sturdiness of the top, but if you are careful when you lift it, it is OK. It looks great though

Decent table, but packaging was awful - spent an hour cleaning up.The lifting mechanism is so-so.It'll lift, but it doesn't like to work well. You have to lift it about perfectly or it goes at an angle.It slams down if you don't gently guide it.

This table looks good when built, but I can tell it won‚Äôt hold up well to normal wear and tear. It was difficult but not impossible to put together. I like this product, but don‚Äôt feel it will still look good in a year

Three pieces arrived scratched‚Ä¶one of them significantly. It seems like it will scratch very easily in the future. The sturdiness of the top as it‚Äôs being lifted up and down leaves something to be desired. Otherwise it is a sturdy table.

The table was easy to assemble good installation instructions, fairly good quality, sturdy enough. The packaging and handling was really poor the table was already damaged on delivery. I understand that the seller can't control how the package is handled, but they can prevent some damages from happening with a better packaging.

Hardware is cheap. U have to lift from both sides or else it will bend.

The entirety seems fine. However, you need to hold on to all side in order to lift the lifting top. It bends wonky.

We love the table. We eat dinner on it in front of the tv. So comfortable with the lift feature. However it comes in like a thousand pieces and took 2 days to assemble. So do not buy this unless you are super handy. Most of the pieces were not marked like they were supposed to be. Very heavy as well. A return would have been brutal. Glad my husband is good at putting things together.

great looking table very sturdy box and one piece was damaged but not in a place where you will see so i didn't send it back.

I had a pull up coffee table but decided to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to one with storage. Love the looks, love the storage. If you don‚Äôt use two hands to raise the top it will wabble. Once its up (or down) it‚Äôs fine. Just a little disappointed with the hinge assembly

I purchase this table in Jan of 2022. The top is already cracking and pealing off.I am not happy with this table at all

I love the color and the function. You have to be careful with it because it ships very easily.

Was horrible to put together, very pretty and matched the tv stand almost to a T was way smaller then what I imagined but it will do

Assembly is about the same price of the table itself

For the money it's a pretty good table, you have to have some patience to put it together, and when assembled it is a little flimsier than I expected.

Pretty nice table. Alot smaller than i thought. Corners are very sharp so be careful. Hinges are cheap and flimsy. Top doesnt open straight up unless you grip it on both sides. Drawers are ok. Tracks on drawers are also cheap so they dont open very smooth. All in all ok table for what they charged.

The weight of the top is too much for the hinges and allow the lid to swivel from side to side. The lid cannot be raised without using both hands firmly.

For the price, its' a nice table.  When I started to review the parts and instructions, I was able to measure dimension of storage compartments, and it was not going to fit our needs.

Love the look of the table and that the drawers can be on either side depending on how you want the table to lift. Unfortunately the hardware wasn‚Äôt complete and I cant connect the piece needed to lift the table.

Cheap looking table but serves the purpose it was needed for

We bought bookcases, side tables, and a TV stand from Ikea, which took a whole weekend and was an ordeal to put together!  We were looking for a well-made, sturdy, and nice table for our son's living room and came across this table.  The added bonus is that it lifts up, makes computer work easier, and has additional hidden stores.  The package was so heavy, but it was packed well.  It comes with its tools, so there is no need to purchase or look for any tools, which is a bonus.  It was so easy to assemble!  He loves it, and it looks great in his living room.

I‚Äôm so glad I purchased this, I was back and forth between a few different options for a few months now and ultimately settled on this one because of the layers of storage potential it offered. I‚Äôm so glad I did bc it fits perfectly in my tiny living room, it‚Äôs a great size, it was actually pretty easy to build (I‚Äôm petite 26 year old woman who was able to build it all by myself and it includes the one tool you need which is a screwdriver so that was pretty convenient and I had no trouble) and it‚Äôs actually pretty darn good quality for Amazon furniture. Some of the stuff can be iffy on here and you kinda just get what you‚Äôre paying for so it‚Äôs easy to get cheap items for cheap quality, but this one looks really nice and the wood pierces are pretty darn hefty.All in all, worth the purchase. I‚Äôm very satisfied and now I have some place to eat in my tiny home that is too small for a kitchen table.

The unit went together, easy enough.  Bit took 45 minutes. The material is laminated particleboard, and you would probably have to be careful with water on the surface. The top seems to be heavier, lamination, and hold up better than I am currently expecting.  But for $150 it does look nice and the top works and there‚Äôs plenty of storage space to hide things.

This table was exactly as advertised. It was relatively easy to assemble. I am 75 and my husband is 79 and we did it ourselves.  The quality of the material is good. The drawers slide well and the left mechanism works perfectly and the table top is a sufficient thickness to provide stability. We are very happy with our table and feel it was well worth the price.

Packaged securely,Easy to assemble, Perfect for our needs and Looks great too!

Outstanding coffee table! Great instructions. Very easy to understand. The assembly took me about an hour. I'm an old maintenance guy so a couple tips that may help. I used my regular multipurpose screwdriver #2 Phillips. Put the two drawer handles on first before assembling the drawers. When you get to the end and have the hinges installed on the table top then set up something to set the extended top on while you screw it together inside. If doing alone. I like furniture sliders. Makes life a lot easier. The height with the top closed came to 19.5 inches. Perfect for me. Great for eating,  using the laptop, putting your feet up, playing board games. You name it. The lower drawers on this 47" table are big area wise. Not very deep. Which is ok because you get a lot of front to back and left to right space. The middle and top compartment under the table top are very roomy! This coffee table is good quality. Heavy duty. You need two hands to raise and lower the top. The reason is because it's simply huge. The hinges are far apart. So you need to help it out in the middle (one hand in the front and back). I love the look and many storage spaces. It's like the compartment under the top isn't even there. Really great table!

This was assembled quickly. The color and quality is good.we love it as we can keep thing on the drawers (2) .its so versatile to he a center table in our small living room and it can be used as a computer or work table at the same time.it fits so well and its heavy duty .

This is a very nice table.  One of the cool parts is you can have it raise from either side - meaning the drawers at the bottom can open on either side.  I put together one way and set in place and then decided I wanted the drawers to open on my couch side so re-positioned the top.  Comes with all the tools for assembly and I put it together myself.  The overall table is sturdy, I only give it points off for the wobbly bit when raising the top.  You wouldn't want to get too crazy with the top out - one has to be a bit careful with it.  Not as sturdy as another one I have.  But I like it.

This coffee table has absolutely changed how we keep the clutter down on our living room!  The lift top is great for when we need to do some quick work on our laptops or just play a card game.  It has plenty of extra storage and looks great as well!

For a ‚Äúput it together yourself‚Äù sort of purchase honestly this was a good deal. I only gave it 4 stars because the drawers are deceptively small so my initial plan to keep candles in there is thwarted. Directions are clear, took just under an hour, and it honestly looks great in the room. I‚Äôd say this is a step above dorm room but not quite adult house.

Make sure wooden dowels are pushed all the way in or they will push through when attaching pieces together. One of the threaded pieces in the top was missing its threads.

This is a great coffee table.I like how you can mount the top so can have the drawers facing you or away.  I selected the assembly option of having the drawers on the opposite side as I figured there would be no room to open the drawers if I had them facing the couch and with my feet being in between.I got the espresso color option, a nice dark brown color.You can put this table together on your own, just be patient as you fit everything together.  The entire table can be assembled with the supplied screw driver.  There is a bag of spare parts.  There are wood grain stickers for the inside of the top to cover/hide the assbley screws so you don't see the hardware when you open the top.All-in-all it's a great table, pretty sturdy when assembled, although you'd never want to put body weight on it.  The reason for the four stars is it's pressed wood (as expected), but its very light weight so it's probably pine wood scraps it's made from.  This make the table very light.  Would have been nice if they had included bit of harder woods into it to give the table a little more weight and sturdyiess to it.  Because it's pressed soft wood, this is why I say to be paitient while assembling so you don't accidently strip screw holes, break the dowels, etc.  If you can get it assembled without issue, don't put extreme weight in/on it and do your best to not gouge/scratch it, it's a very nice coffee table.

The flaw that stuck out for me is that pull up table top, the hydraulics that comes with it aren't the sturdiest so they have a wobble to them when it is extended. If there was something else that can be added to provide some strength that would be perfectOther than that, the table is really nice, good weight to it and a great length. I purchased the 47 inch table and it fits really well in our media room. Would not mind getting a second one for the living room but it is a little pricey but not too bad, will give it some thought over the next couple of months or so

I really like the table overall but opening it is not smooth and if you have things on it before opening it takes two people for me to be able to do it confidently. Easy to clean and I like to storage

I do like this table. My only complaint would be that it's a little bit cheaper quality than I expected, but all in all it's a, great table

This table is everything I wanted: lift top with storage, drawers, and an open middle space.The quality for the price is amazing. It feels very sturdy. Heavy enough to not easily move (the item is around 50 lbs). We have it on hardwood floor and it will definitely slide if you put your feet up to rest against the edge of it, but not super easily.Easy to assemble - comes with everything you need. Very clear directions, the holes all lined up perfectly, I put this together by myself in roughly an hour and a half  (unboxing, set up, and clean up). The most challenging part of assembly was keeping my cat away from the partially put together pieces.The lift top feels a little uneven, but this is likely my own doing as I have not properly adjusted it. There's directions for how to adjust the top to be even when lifting and putting down. You need two hands for the lift top. It locks in place when up (to keep it from falling - this is a good thing) so it's a bit of a push to get it to start going back down. With it being on hardwood floor, I have to hold the table in place to get the lift top to start moving down to keep the whole table from sliding. The drawers at the bottom slide smoothly.Had this for roughly 2 months and love it. Can't speak to the longevity, but hoping it last! I would 100% purchase this table again.

Just not as well built as we thought it would be

I wanted a lift-top table and choose this one for the additional storage space with the drawers at the bottom. We have a dog who occasionally throws her toys and bones into the table when she's thrashing them, and kids who have spent the last several months leaning their entire weight on one side of the open top, opening it the wrong way, creating heavy/sharp/giant rock collections in the inside storage, kicking/pushing/standing on the drawers, throwing things around it and "accidentally" hitting the table, tripping on/in the table, leaving condensation puddles under their water bottles right on the table instead of using a conveniently stored coaster from the bottom drawer just 8 inches away... you get the idea. *Being kids.* And I have to say, it's holding up reeeeally well to their abuse, lol. Still looks brand new and the hinges (which I keep expecting to snap) are doing great.It isn't the fanciest, most stylish, or expensive looking table (it's engineered wood with a melamine finish), but for these years where kids and dogs and life show a little more wear and tear on our furniture, I have to say I do like how solid this little table is.

I read a couple reviews that said it was easy to put together and that‚Äôs one reason I ordered it. Well, it took me about a half hour to get it out of the box and don‚Äôt know what to do with the literal mountain of Styrofoam and now it‚Äôs sitting here waiting for my spouse to assemble it. I think you can see why. But on the other hand, each piece, there seem to be hundreds of them, appears to be very sturdy and well-made, so I‚Äôm hopeful that it‚Äôs going to be a great coffee table!

I love this table... It was simple to assemble UNTIL it was time for the top to be installed... Read read and re read those instructions... But when I got it I got it... ü§™

Needs frequent cleaning because of the material but looks good and is functional.

This is a good, more inexpensive option for a coffee table. It has great storage and different color options.It did take me about 3 hours in total to get it fully assembled. It was pretty straightforward, up until installing the lift top. It took me a good 45 mins to figure out how to get it installed correctly, which could be my own fault, but I think the manual could have been a but clearer, especially for someone who has never built a lift top table.At 1st, I thought there was an issue with my hinges. I couldn't get the top to sit flush with the rest of the table, so I took the whole thing off 3 times to figure it out. I read through reviews that also had issues with the hinges, so I figured maybe I just got sent hydrologic ones instead of spring loaded. I figured I'd try attaching the hinges to the inside of the table 1st and then try attaching the top, and this is when I found out that I was putting the top on backwards which was causing it not to sit flush.I'm not sure if this is the same issue other reviewers are having with their tops not sitting flush, but I docked a star just because I think the manual could have shown not to flip the top around.Other then the long assembly time, everything else is perfect.

This is a great little coffee table, especially for the price. Very solid, weighty construction. The build is very laborious and lengthy though, about 30 steps if I recall. If you‚Äôre willing to put in the work it‚Äôs a great buy.

Definitely some assembly required! Everything was well labeled and the directions were easy to follow. All the parts were there. It was pretty easy to put together but like any China furniture, it's particle board so you have to be careful putting the hardware in. Really can't complain for the money. I'll be curious to see how long the gas shocks last because they typically are garbage on products like this. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is it's a little on the flimsy side as far as moving the table from down to up and back down. It's fine if you pinch it from center and pull up or grab it from each side but it's definitely a little rickety coming up and down but all in all not a bad product for the money.

Easy to build, very sturdy. Only reason for 4 stars is that it doesn‚Äôt look a little cheap.

This is a very cute coffee table and it wasn't too hard to build, took maybe a little over an hour. My only complaint is the lift up is a little wobbly, and at the end it even tells you that if it does that it's wrong but doesn't tell you how to fix it, which is a little annoying. Also the base of the drawers is very thin and doesn't seem like it could hold anything too heavy. I really like it other than that.

I liked the finish on this table, it seems sturdy and it was fun to put together (except the last step of putting the table top on.)  I think it took me 2 hours but I was being very methodical and making sure I was following the directions correctly.  The directions were pretty easy to follow--except for the top.  It doesn't look like a piece you'd want if you have children.  It's that sort of thing that looks like it will get nicks and scratches easily.  The top raises up higher than I'd like and so far I haven't figured out if that's adjustable.  I think my couch seats are lower than most.Warning--use a different screw driver than the one they supplied.  The handle gave me a huge blister.Also, the table top instructions didn't inform well so that I had to take it off and turn it around.  I put it in the right place, but nothing in the instructions mentioned the right left orientation.  So that took an extra half hour.

The table is beautiful but one piece arrived damaged in two places. We put it together since the damage only shows when it is up.  Too expensive to return. Saddened by this.

Its a good piece for the price. Feels solid, looks great. Assembled pretty quick. Added some wood glue to the dowels. Only suggestion I have is to not over tighten anything. Just past snug is good. Anything past that risks a tear-out.

Table was easy to assemble when following the directions. Alone it only took me 90 minutes including sorting the parts as I unboxed it.Gripes:  The instructions are missing the step to put the dowels into item 11. Along with item 5 that should be installed after step 15 because it interferes with that assembly. Even then Step 16 is close to impossible with the supplied screwdriver as it's 2x as long as the space behind item 5 where the B Cam is. Also, I installed the drawer handles BEFORE attaching the drawer fronts, handle screws are way close to the bottom of the drawer, it was easier that way. The supplied clear corner guards were in the trash 2 hours after I put them on, 4 tiny pieces of 3M tape. IMO they should be slip-overs with a small retaining screw underneath.That all said it, is sturdy enough for 2 to eat from and supports my 7lb gaming laptop with ease.The drawers are shallow but roll nice and are a great place for chargers and misc. cables.I purchased 2 shelving storage baskets separately for the open shelf along with a power strip and a RGB led strip for accent lighting.

Not very easy to put together.  The broken drawer piece was replaced after some back and forth with the seller. You could tell they wanted to make it right.

Was able to put this together by myself (while in 3rd trimester of pregnancy) in about 2 hours. Would have gone a little faster if I used drill instead of putting in all screws with screwdrivers provided. Directions were very clear and easy to follow.Feels sturdy. Comes with pads already attached underneath to protect floor. Also, pads under moveable tabletop to keep the closure from slamming. I also liked that it came with clear stick on corner protectors.Came with all pieces (and even a bag with extra pieces in case you would need any in the future) & none of table parts had any damage upon delivery.4 stars instead of 5, because it‚Äôs a bit wobbly as table top lifts and lowers. Probably needs a bar connecting the two hinges that raise and lower to make sure it happens simultaneously and doesn‚Äôt wiggle at all. I also wish they would have made table top straight edges more bullnosed or rounded. With little kids I could see needing to baby proof those sharp straight edges in case of a fall.

The table looks nice, opens and closes as advertised and is stable enough for me to lean on it with a decent amount of my weight (I'm a 6'2 guy who weighs about 185 lbs.) There's really only one thing I don't like about the table and that is that unless you hold and guide it, it's sort of jerks to the fully open position or fully closed position. When closing, I have to hold it to make sure the top part of the table doesn't slam violently to the bottom. When pulling it up to the open position, I have to guide it slowly so that plates or cups don't move around. Other than that, solid purchase for the money. Setup took a couple hours and I'm fairly experienced with putting things like this together.

Put this in my game room to hold my controllers and headset, works wonderful. holding up well so far. Good valve for the money.

Very handy to be able to raise the table surface, just make sure to use two hands to do it. Drawers glide smoothly. Assembly is a bit time consuming but directions are very straightforward. We‚Äôre adding wheels with brakes so it can be easily moved. Should be designed with/come with swivel wheels because as you change the usage and height of the table, you will need a different proximity to the table from your seated position. Wish it looked more authentically wood-like.

This is perfect for puzzle movie nights without breaking your back and was fairly easy and quick to assemble with my husband. I love the look and size and all the storage, the only thing I don't love is how wobbly the top feels when moving up and down. You have to use two hands to keep it level as you lift or it won't want to go or get a little stuck. Nothing product breaking, but if that was smoother and sturdier this would be a 5 star product for me. That being said the price was very reasonable too so I'll deal with it, though I'd be wary of kids wanting to play with it.

Exactly what I was looking for.

This table was easy to put together. It does have lots of parts, so it‚Äôs not a quick build( about 2 hours) but everything was well labeled. Storage is great. The drawers aren‚Äôt as deep as I was thinking but still a good place to put remotes. The box arrived damaged sadly. So the table had a dent in it. Shipped through FedEx. Overall, this is a great table. I can raise my table top up with one hand. It does take 2 hands to lower the top. But that is to be expected for the stability of the top when raised. Table is 5 stars. I gave it 4 because of the shipping.

Product color is accurate. Product is easy to assemble despite many pieces. Top does lift but is not as sturdy and fixed to the table as desired

I was hesitant with the reviews, but all I can say is that from my experience, the product arrived in picture perfect shape, no dents, scrapes or missing pieces. What I like about the table is that it‚Äôs easy to clean. I got BLACK but I‚Äôve used degreaser on the top to clean without any damage to the tabletop. No paint came off. I assume there‚Äôs some type of protective coating on it. Moving the tabletop up and down takes both hands, otherwise, or it kind of moves unevenly. but it always ends even in its final position. Also it doesn‚Äôt slam down, but goes down somewhat gently. I put it together by myself, but the last step of attaching the tabletop might take 2 people for some. I was able to get creative and used my sofa + a box to partially hold up the tabletop to attach it myself. Look at the directions carefully. Everything is labeled but it‚Äôs easy to get confused. You have to be exact in matching the position of the pieces with the picture to make sure you aren‚Äôt doing anything backwards. I was careful but even I managed to mess up one and had to redo a portion. But some parts require glue and you don‚Äôt want to make a mistake at that part with glueing in dowels in the wrong holes or it will be impossible to get out.Overall this was a positive purchase. I can now raise the tabletop when I‚Äôm eating or doing something on my laptop while sitting back on my sofa.

This table went together without any issues, easy. I decided to use the top compartment as a power/charging station. It worked out beautifully! I power and charge anything I want very easy without a bunch of cables exposed. Neat and tidy! Every single thing you see in the pics is available on Amazon.  DISCLAIMER! IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BUY VERY GOOD PRODUCTS THAT ARE UL LISTED OR ETL LISTED and CORRECTLY INSTALL ALL ELEMENTS WITH PRECISION AND FORETHOUGHT. Plan it out! Do not use simple extension cords. I used thick, stick on furniture pads on every corner. It raised the table top by 1/2 leaving both a way for heat to escape and prevents the cords  from being crimped between the table and table top

Maybe its just me but I can't get motivated to get this together .I'm sure its a good product one I get it together .Does come with a nice screw driver though

Couple hours to set up by 21 yo son, needed extra pair of hands at certain points, would not recommend if you have young kids as sturdiness is questionable,  love the lift feature. Finger marks show easily on black.

I purchased this coffee table to replace another lift top coffee table that was just too big for the space.  This table had good reviews and looked like the dimensions were the right size for the space.  The coffee table arrived very well packaged.  The instructions were the best assembly instructions I've seen.The only problem I have is that once it was assembled and I tried the lift top, I was completely surprised at how flimsy the lift springs were.  You have to lift the table from the middle only as it looks like the lift springs don't work in unison.  Frankly, it looks a bit cheap in my updated redecorated space.  I will put this in my family room rather than the main living space.I ordered the Espresso color thinking that it would match the other furniture in the room, but it was much lighter in real life.  I took the chance with this purchase thinking that it might be what I was looking for, that's why I still gave this table a 4-star review overall because for one, you get what you pay for, and I would admit that it is worth what I paid for it, and 2, I didn't assume that it would be the equivalent of a real wood table.

This coffee table has exactly the features I was looking for - lots of storage, and sturdy enough to act as foot/leg rest.  It was also economically priced.  The coffee table was boxed well, but it was incredibly heavy.  I struggled to pull it in the house after it was delivered (I'm a reasonably strong middle aged woman).  I was intimidated by some of the other reviews stating challenges with assembly, but I consider myself reasonably competent at putting things together.  So, I bit the bullet and unpacked the components.  After confirming receipt of all the pieces (which were labelled well), I began assembly.  It took about two hours (25 steps), and I was able to do all but the lift- top on my own.  I needed a second set of hands to help lift it on and hold it steady while I screwed in the hardware.  The finish is quite nice, and I only noticed one blemish on one of the legs.  It is not noticeable, so I am not concerned at all.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the quality, features, and ease of assembly.  The only reason I didn't give the table 5 stars is related the lift-top.  It does require two hands to move, and doesn't feel as "solid" as I'd like.  I worry that it may be too flimsy to stand the test of time.

Sturdy coffee table has corner protection stick on things to go on it but don‚Äôt stay very well. Not crazy about the sharp corners knee bangers, but other than that very sturdy, pretty good looking coffee table.

I received the box and checked to make sure I had everything. I was going along with the direction which are super easy, all of the hardware it separately bagged and easy to navigate! When I got to the step to put the sides together that make up the drawer I noticed that there was a manufacturing error on the one side labeled ‚ÄúL‚Äù the ridge where the bottom of the drawer should slide through was on the wrong side. I called Amazon customer service and they offered to send out a new one to take the piece I need to replace feee of charge. All In all I was able to finish assembling the table and it turned out exactly how I expected! Great purchase in the end

I really like the look and design of the table plenty of storage

First, this assembly takes a long time. Due to the combination of wooden dowels and metal binding post screws that fit into nearly identical holes, you MUST follow the directions, because you won't be able to just figure out what goes in what hole by intuition. If you follow the directions tho, you'll do fine. Get yourself a full sized screw driver, or a drill if you can be gentle with it, to speed up assembly.Once completed, it looks nice, is pretty decent value for the money. Seems sturdy enough, given the relatively cheap cost.The lifting and closing of the lid is just a little less smooth than I'd hoped. Not uncommon for one side to raise above the other, or for the whole table top to feel like it's twisting a bit if you don't life it perfectly evenly. Also, the spring mechanism is maybe a little too strong for the light weight of the table, so sometimes you'll be pushing or dragging the whole unit if you don't hold it down while opening or closing. Minor complaints overall, as none of these flaws feel like they're causing any damage to the mechanism. Just maybe don't have a drink on it when lifting or lowering the top.

It wasn't too difficult to put together, and it's sturdy. My family likes being able to lift the top to use to eat.

What a beautiful table, it was a house warming gift and they loved it.. It was easy to put together and compatible with their existing furniture.

I like this table a lot. Lots of storage and it's great for when you're eating in the living room. One of the parts unfortunately broke during assembly, but I reached out to customer service and they were super prompt to help. Only downside is they had to ship it from China so it took about a month to get to me. But I'm keeping it 5 stars because of their great customer service and the table works great.

Great product! Looks amazing and surprisingly easy to put together. The top lifts and lowers well while still feeling safe. Love the look of it, doesn't look cheap.

I like the fact that it raise up and down and top opens.  I can use it like a small desk and work on it with my laptop

This table's instructions where so well thought out. It was honestly the easiest to put together and it is very sturdy and looks great! I am very satisfied with this.

This table is crap. Don't waste your money.It is not pre assembled and it isn't even even.The directions aren't clear but the pieces are made cheap.No pieces were missing but this is not good material. The holes in the directions were marked wrong and nit all pieces were labeled.The drawers are off and so are Tha angles. I'm discussed.

Took about 2 hours to put together. While putting it together, I worried about losing parts only to discover the last bag contained extra parts. Great instructions. Looks Good. All holes matched up perfectly. Quality product.

So beautiful. The finish on the tabletop is so smooth and easy to clean. Heavy duty table. I got the larger size in the washed oak color. Lovely. SO EASY to put together. Only needs a second person to attach the top to the hinges. You can't go wrong with this one!!!

I‚Äôm impressed. This was a great experience as far as furniture you have to assemble yourself. The materials were packed extremely well, no scratches. The instructions were crystal clear, the pieces were all marked, furniture parts numbered and screws etc by letters. Came with a sturdy Phillips head screwdriver, which I will keep. I‚Äôm 63 years young and I put it together by myself. I‚Äôd buy from this company again. Love it!

Awesome coffee table - exactly as advertised. My family loves it. It has served us well over a year now and there are no signs of wear or breaking. Wonderful purchase!

Looks good, easy to put together and comes with extra hardware. :)

Instructions were great everything fits as supposed to good quality and sturdy!

Very accurate instructions. All parts were well labeled, all parts included, including a screw driver. There was even a bag of extra parts, just in case.

I absolutely love this coffee table. It's so perfect for my tiny cabin and the quality is wonderful. I put the whole thing together myself and it wasn't super hard if you follow the directions. Once I got to putting the drawers together, that's where it got tricky. On the directions it shows something completely different and was confusing. It showed that the roller part was supposed to be on the top and didnt align with the lines for the board. Once i figured it out everything else was smooth sailing.I love the storage it has and it completely compliments my living room.Buy it!! You don't regret it. ü§ç

The table came very well packaged and arrived in perfect condition despite some slight damage to the corners of the box (no big deal). All the pieces were included, and the drilled holes matched up well as needed. There was even a package of spare parts, including some that were listed in manual, but weren‚Äôt detailed in the instructions so I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre for. Entertainment purposes to see how many times we go through the instructions maybe?Easy to put together, pretty foolproof as long as you take a moment to orient a few of the pieces and realize what needs to be done.Altogether very pleased with this table, and would recommend to anyone interested.

Easy assembly, great quality

Love this table but very hard to pull the top up.

Made out of real wood.  I couldn't put it together but husband had no problem.  Looks just as advertised and going to check out the seller's other furniture.

This coffee table is good quality.  It didn't take me long to put it together.  It took me about half an hour to put it together, but I am pretty experienced putting furniture together.  I used a side table to hold the lid up while I put the screws in.  Without that, I would have needed another person to hold it.  The lid hinge is a little flimsy, bit if you use care when opening and closing the lid it should last quite a while.  I would recommend this coffee table if you're looking for one

We ordered this for our guest room which will be used as a second office and wanted a coffee table that could double as a desk as needed. We've had similar furniture pieces and used them for years! Hoping this one lasts as long.Given the instructions included using wood glue (supplied) where the wood pegs go, we're confident it will last a long time!It took two of us 2 1/2 hours to build this. There were no mistakes and we followed the directions to a T. Even so when they instructed (all were pictures btw) to put the pads on the corner for a soft close, I put them on the corners when they should have gone in a bit for a more seamless look and utility. They still work but I was annoyed that most of the pad not even hitting where it's supposed to (See pictures). This isn't really a problem though just annoyed. Otherwise easy enough assembly, just took forever!In pictures you'll see I made it so the table pulls up and put towards the drawers which will be facing me when I'm sitting on the couch. That way I can store chargers, or other small office supplies as needed for work. The top storage and drawer storage are not very deep, so it won't be much! You could probably keep some placemats in there or napkins if you wanted to eat here. Bottom shelf can easily hold magazines, blankets or shoes depending on need. You could probably put some shallow baskets down there as well if desired. Overall I'm happy, and hoping it lasts for a long while.

It looks nice

Works really well, durable, comes with edge guards for kiddos, and easy to assemble. Great value for the price.

The directions were incredibly clear! I love this coffee table and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough! If you‚Äôre on the fence, just get it!

Very easy to assemble and it feels very sturdy. Everything comes included even a screwdriver if you don't have one. Directions are also easy to follow.  The drawers work perfect to stash extra controllers, magazines, as well as any other miscellaneous things you keep on your coffee table. I would definitely recommend this product especially if you're looking for a replacement table with extra storage options.

The folding table aspect is really handy to store the things you need to keep handy.

Easy to build. Solid. No snagging with the lid. I'd buy again.

Great table for the price!  Sturdy and if one is patient and organized it assembles with ease.VERY Important!!  Review all the instructions and lay out all the pieces and parts before you begin to assemble.  It took me 5 to 6 hours to assemble from opening the box.  I, a 73 year old lady, who is very cautious, had no problems.  Did need a helping hand for the last two steps.Recommend this product.  Especially like the size.  I needed a lift-up table to place in front of a Love-seat couch and this one is perfect.  Had originally looked at Amish made tables,  for over $1200,  This is not the quality of a hand-made all wood table, But i meets my need.Thank you Amazon for selling it.

For the money, this is a really solid product. Assembly was about what I expected, not exactly easy but not the most difficult. Once I got it together, it looks pretty good and functions as advertised. Under the top, you can fit a couple of small throw blankets and the bottom two drawers are decent for a tablet, laptop and charger cables.

Very nice table, easy to assemble, clear instructions, solid construction.

This was a gift for my son. He doesn‚Äôt have room for a dining table and he needed storage. This coffee table solves all of the problems. They can sit on the couch and eat, it has 3 levels of storage. He and his family love it.

I put this together in less than an hour and it feels very sturdy. It also looks great in our living room!

Bought this coffee table for the storage + lift top. It‚Äôs a great color! I was worried about the sturdiness of the lift top when assembling, but as long as you lift with both hands, the table is PERFECT - it‚Äôs only a little wobbly on the lift/descent because of the hinge. Once it‚Äôs fully lifted or lowered, it‚Äôs 100% sturdy and I feel confident about working and eating at the table. Assembly wasn‚Äôt too bad - had the help of my boyfriend (who refused to use the wood glue on his pieces üôÑ). I feel like the screws, pegs, glue, hinge, drawers, and most of the wood is very high quality! The flimsiest piece is the bottom of the drawers + bottom of the main compartment. Those are very thin and flimsy, which I suppose is how the cost was kept down. I wouldn‚Äôt drop a hammer into the drawers, but if you‚Äôre storing things like board games or even plates, you should be totally fine. There was no visible damage, scuffs, or marks on any of the pieces - and even if there were, the product comes with little stickers to cover up screws that you could totally use on marks! Overall, I‚Äôd say this is a 10/10 product for your money! One of the best furniture pieces I‚Äôve gotten from Amazon.

There is nothing I don't like about this table.  I bought this piece with my son in mind when he is sitting using his laptop or building his heli's or eating while watching TV.  He put this together himself within an hour.  The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.  He feels the frame is not cheap and is very sturdy.  The top moves very nicely to open and close with plenty of storage space (laptop fits nicely) and the drawers give it a little extra touch.  Very happy with the appearance in my living room and love the weight of the table.  I would recommend this piece and would definitely buy it again!!

This is the size coffee table that I needed, not quite the width for the love seat I have. It is constructed from particle board with a veneer, must be careful when screwing in the provided posts for the interlocking cams or it will strip out the particle board. The box I received, everything was well packaged with no damage. The instructions were clear enough. The lift mechanism is anchored solidly once screwed into place. The inserts for the lifting mechanism are factory installed into the table top and the base. So there was no worry about misalignment or placement when putting it together. For the price and construction it is what I expected, not the highest quality furniture ever but its sturdy enough for what I use it for.

Good quality as well as does not seem to be a cheap piece of furniture. Time consuming but easy to assemble. A few minor flaws. Noting serious. Still gets 5 stars. Very affordably priced and I think they use chip board in stead of particle board which is better. Easy instructions. Easy assembly. Love it.

When assembled it was in perfect condition with no scratches.The top moves easily and smoothly.It is rock-solid thanks to being glued *and* screwed together. (Seriously, you can't get this to wiggle in the slightest.) Plenty of glue is also included.The top provides plenty of space and the lower shelf and drawers can hold laptops and tablets out of view.With that being said, it does take a surprising amount of time to assemble.I'm a flat-pack veteran; having assembled dozens of pieces over the years.This was, by far, the most difficult.It took me about 3 hours to do by myself.It required an entire 9' by 11' area to assemble without scratching anything.There was also a flaw in the illustration for how to assemble the piece K. It said to insert a dowel near the edge away from the cams. No such hole exists and instead it goes into the middle hole.Suggestions for assembly: rather than instruct the user to place the foam pads at the edges of the top, put them in line with the top of the legs for a smoother landing.Dowels should have glue put on them and then inserted rather than gluing in the hole. Make sure they're in firmly.The top is difficult to mount by yourself. I'd suggest only putting one or two screws in and then tackling the other side. Be patient as it's very (very) finicky and easy to cross-thread and strip the bolts.it came with small adhesive plastic corner pieces with no indication of intended use.If you're looking at this and you can deal with the baskets of the similar style I'd strongly recommend that instead. The assembly should be much easier, with far fewer pieces, fasteners, etc.

Can't tell you much experience with the table as I just assembled it today.But I can tell you that in years of assembling flat-pack furniture I can't recall anything that came with a manual as good as this. Large format (8.5x11) with clear illustrations.Several pages showing exactly what pieces are needed (and each is labeled with a number, in the book and on the wood).Full illustration and count for each type of assembly hardware (and a screwdriver included), and a supply of spares.Each step of the construction is on a page with a large clear diagram that actually matches the pieces and the holes, and list what hardware and how many will be needed for that step.In short, what EVERY manual should be. If you've had a bad experience or are afraid to self-assemble, this is what you need; I hope the company's other products are as well-documented.

It was easy to assemble,  parts well labeled.  Nice table for a flat pack type furniture.

Works great and is the perfect size for me.

I really like this coffee table.I saw this style at one of my friends house and always wanna buy it and finally came across this one here.We had little hard time to put this together but it wasn't too bad.Love the color,goes well with my other decor,like that It has drawers to store stuff. Pull out top part is the best feature of course.Overall really happy with this purchase.

It was actually very easy to put together. The design is very spacious and while it‚Äôs light for its size, it‚Äôs pretty sturdy. We had more than enough parts to get it assembled, as there were extra screws packaged. Tools, also, despite being inexpensive. The color is exactly what it said on the review, and it‚Äôs nice.

Wasn't too difficult to assemble. The illustrations in the instructions were printed so dark and small though and it was really difficult to see where the holes for things were or how certain parts line up. Would definitely suggest making the pictures larger and less dark. Took an hour or so to put together. Looks really nice and the LED light strip was easy. You just stick it on there and use the clips to support the actual wire part where it plugs in. Honestly you should probably stick the LEDs on while the desk is still upside down so you can get them nice and straight and actually see what you're doing, since they stick up underneath the shelf. I'd like to mention that if you have wood floors like we do, they need to be pretty close to perfectly level or the desk will wobble quite a lot. You can sort of twist the little round pegs that go on the bottoms of the legs to try and balance the desk better. The good things are that it's pretty, arrived undamaged, wasn't too hard to put together by myself and it's mostly sturdy. The biggest negative is that it has very little room UNDERNEATH the desk. There's almost nowhere to put your legs and I had to put my PC sideways under the table just to keep it from sticking out. If you have a swivel chair like I do, you might find yourself banging your knees on the pointy edges of your computer shell. Make sure you roll BACK and then turn. Yeah, it's that cramped. I'm 5'9" 160 pounds and I'm really wedged in there while streaming. The rest is good though. There's just no space under the desk and nothing to put your PC on. The desk surface itself is too small and the bars and supports under the desk prevent you from having much room for anything underneath. The top shelf part is too narrow to set a PC on, even when sideways. If you are going for aesthetics, this is fine. It's very cramped and small but it's passable. 4 stars.

I knew when I opened the box I had made the right choice! This was so well packed I was amazed. Instructions were very easy to follow. I have CHF and oxygen dependent emphysema/chronic respiratory failure and I was able to put this together by myself. I just love the shade of pink! The led's are a bonus I did attach them to the desk but you could use them anywhere. Amazing value, this is worth so much more than I paid.  I have a desktop tower with led's, 2 monitors and room for a 17 inch laptop. Plenty of space. I highly recommend this desk and company.

I recently bought the pink LED-lit work desk, originally designed for gaming, and I must say that it has seamlessly transitioned into an essential component of my professional workspace. From the outset, I was pleasantly surprised by the impeccable alignment of the pre-drilled holes, which facilitated a swift and hassle-free assembly process. The accompanying assembly instructions were clear and concise, ensuring that I could set up the desk with ease.Upon completion, the desk's visual appeal surpassed my expectations. The vibrant pink hue, complemented by the integrated LED lights, adds a touch of modern sophistication to my workspace. The desk's sleek and stylish design, combined with thoughtful attention to detail, has significantly enhanced the aesthetic appeal of my office environment.Functionally, the desk provides an expansive and organized surface area that perfectly accommodates my professional needs. It easily houses my computer monitor, keyboard, and other work essentials, while the built-in usb and outlets are a plus! keeps my workspace clutter-free and streamlinedIn conclusion, I am thoroughly impressed with the pink LED-lit work desk. Its seamless integration into my professional setup, coupled with its outstanding quality, design, and user-friendly assembly, has made it a standout addition to my workspace. Whether for gaming or professional use, this desk offers both style and functionality, making it a versatile and chic choice for any workspace. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a visually appealing and practical work desk.

Perfect alignment. Looks good and is sturdy. Relatively easy to put together with included tools. Perfect gaming table and school desk for my college student.

UPDATE:  The company gave us a full refund.  We didn't ask for that but apparently they are a good company that believes in excellent customer satisfaction.We assembled and set up our desk and love it for the most part.  Downfalls are the corners are very sharp and pointed whereas could've / should've been rounded for safety.  I've been injured slightly due to this already.The big disappointment is there is no cup holder.  That was one of the selling points we used when choosing our purchase.  But there is no cup holder in our box and nowhere on the instructions does it even mention the cup holder nor show it in the diagrams.Lastly, it has 2 stickers to be attached but it doesn't show where they are supposed to go.  Not even a recommendation of where to put them.

I don't mind this desk, but it's a little weird. If you breathe on it, it wobbles, even though I have it super tightly joined. I don't love that my knees hit the supports when I'm working in the middle section and I don't love that I have to choose between having my laptop super close to me or far away and up on the little shelf. I suppose this is a great desk for an actual desktop computer. I LOVE the cupholder because it eases my mind about the safety of my electronics when I'm drinking, and I love the power strip and USB ports under the shelf. Other than that I love the color and the finish is easy to keep clean. After almost a year with it, there are no dings, dents, or scratches (although I was away from my home traveling for 6 months). It's also a good size in that it fits all my things and feels roomy enough (and I like to spread out and I have tons of gadgets, gear, notebooks, baskets of doodads, etc.) but is compact enough for most spaces, I think. You just need a corner of a room.

I had to glue one of the panels together because they had the holes for the screws on the wrong side and the power strip don‚Äôt work that go on top of the desk don‚Äôt work I would of sent it back for a refund but I gave my old desk away

This is the worst product that I could have purchase. For one the speaker did not come with, and once I assemble the desk, as instructed, when I tried to put the top desk on, the middle screws just came out went through the wood, and now I am just left with the bottom part of the desk. If I still had the box, I would ship it right back to you. I should have just gone with the desk at Walmart. I am very disappointed with this desk. Send me a box, and I will send it back to you.Thanks,Eric

So looking at this picture I thought the desk would be huge.  It is not very "deep" so the keyboard is right in front of the monitor.  The shorter part of the desk is about as big as a monitor... The longer is about as long as a monitor and a half.. the corner is less than a monitor.  I have a 3 monitor setup and it pretty much takes up the entire desk.  WIth having a desk phone, this desk is pretty much a computer only desk and if I need to write something there is not much room to do so.

Desk looks great, has neat features, and the price isn't perfect but it's reasonable. I thought I'd give it a shot.Mistake. It's a pretty veneer over MDF; the legs (the most important parts) screw into weak receptacles that easily tore out of the desk before I'd even finished assembling it. It's a horribly flimsy design; it's not an individual defect (or an assembler) issue, it's a flawed design to the desk itself.Even if I'd built the thing fully without it breaking, any lateral stress to a leg would have torn it out of the desktop. Let me repeat: HORRIBLE DESIGN, DO NOT BUY. Looks pretty, but looks are secondary to it actually working as intended, which this desk does not.Sending it back.

I was excited when my first desk arrived but it had 2 defective pieces that wouldn't allow me to put the screws in to assemble i was patient and understanding I gladly drove 2 cities over to return the defective one and wait for the replacement unfortunately when the second one came it was with a beat up box and more defective pieces than the last I was over it the color is cute but oh wellEdit: waiting for my refund its bs like how does it take so long for my return to get to them when I got the desk within a week and replacement in 1 day ? Ugh Im stuck not being able to buy another desk while I wait for this refund and I need the desk asap!

All 6 boards had the screw holes all in wrong places, can't screw in anything except table legs. Not one screw hole matches up..No screw holes for even cup holder. Had to put bricks under top layer shelves.. so very dissatisfied , to much work to return it. Would like a full refund. Had to rig the whole thing..prolly fall apart within a couple weeks üò† üò°

This fest is very nice and easy to build, however keep in mind the 3 table tops do not along and you might have a gap on one side from and on the other it does not sit flush. Keep in mind, I did not contact the seller/ manufacture of this product as my time is better spent having fun with my kids and not sitting on the phone fire hours. The pictures I‚Äôve posted I told in the evening with the glow stop attached so you can better the the game and how in even it is.

Poor quality.  Holes where the screws go not threaded or metal part that receives screws falls out entirely.  Multiple areas of desk were defective.Literally using super glue to try and get it together since my over excited 12 year destroyed box on arrival, and return / refund only available option.Save yourself some time and look elsewhere - super disappointed at pathetic quality.Would give negative stars if I could

Several pieces were damaged. Didn't fit together well at all, big mark on desktop(that I was able to get off).  Very disappointed in this product, holes didn't match when attaching the top shelf.  I was able to get it sort of together and the only reason was because daughter loves the pink, but I don't expect this to last.  I would return it but that would involve packing it back up and going thru that process, just not worth it.  I would not buy this again.

I bought 3 desk, one for each of my sons.  Sadly the lights on each desk are on the same frequency so when one child turns his lights on, all the lights come on.  When one child changes his light settings, the other two desk lights change.  Sadly disappointed as we have looked for months and thought we found a good desk with lights.  If someone knows how to change the light frequency,  that would be great.

I think that the quality is not bad for the price but also keep in consideration where is coming from and/or where is made. You get what you pay for.I will tell you right now, when you get it don‚Äôt expect it to be perfect. The LED lights seem to be one of the common issues on this product but the desk is really cute.I personally would have had the desk be built different from the legs that hold it all together.If you want something with more leg space and better quality then go for a different product.

I‚Äôve only had the desk for about a month, and the LEDs nearly caught on fire today. I sat at my desk, and turned them on, the color wouldn‚Äôt change properly and then I saw smoke. Of course, I instantly turned the LEDs off and used my phones camera to see what was going on. The rubber around the led bulbs literally melted within seconds. Desk is great, but be very cautious of the LEDs. Should be a much cheaper price considering these faulty LEDs.

I had this desk for roughly a year and every day it was with me, I loathed it more. It's not sturdy at all. It shakes CONSTANTLY, and it's been one of the worst purchases I've ever made on this terrible website.Also, sitting at it is horrible because a person is unable to be comfortable due do how the feet on the unit work.

Amazon is real piece of work. I asked for new LED lights because I spent a lot of money on this desk and they told me there‚Äôs nothing they could do about it customer service horrible don‚Äôt buy this desk unless you don‚Äôt want  working lights.

The product I received was made of an incredibly weak material and most importantly it came defective. The packaging was also god awful. By the time the box had reached my house. It looked like it had gone through a tornado. And I do not blame the UPS since I‚Äôm a frequent purchaser and this is the first thing I have gotten in such bad condition. Would not recommend at all. A tempered glass desk has a significantly higher build quality at a lower price

This desk looks great. I bought it mainly for the monitor stand. It was a pain trying to get the desk parts to line up flat. After I had everything set up, I realized it was a poorly designed desk that wobbles when you type. The monitor stand is not thick enough to support anything but the lightest monitors.  The way the legs are designed, you can't put anything under the desk. Sure, it's pretty, but it's not functional.  Returned.

The desk didn‚Äôt even make it through set up. The left board snapped from the screws and can‚Äôt be fixed so I spent nearly 200$ for nothing. The desk is beyond flimsy and if you try to move it it just falls apart completely and the wood breaks. I couldn‚Äôt imagine having my expensive gear on here and then it just breaking apart  it‚Äôs even more upsetting because I can‚Äôt even get refunded to buy a better one

The material the board is made out of broke upon flipping the desk over after screwing it together. The leg fell completely off. The package arrived damaged. Have not had a response from the company and to get a return or refund amazon somehow expects me to put it back into a broken box and bring it to a ups center.

It's clear this desk had been returned several times, and was stuck in a 'shipping abyss.' Arrived on my porch with wood debris and metal bolts spilling out of the shredded box, along with foam trash everywhere. Had it survived transit and assembly, despite looking cool it would have likely been doomed to quick damage due to poor construction, particle-board wood construction, and flimsy metal supports.

I was super excited to get this. it arrived and the box was damaged, so I naturally figured the level of packaging inside would have been some sort of protectant. When I opened the package to begin assembly a large chunk of the corner was snapped off one of the main boards. I was very dissatisfied.If I could give this whole thing 0 stars I would

Surface is staining and peeling where I have my laptop. Desk isn't very sturdy and is a pain in the butt to clean with all of aluminum bars on it.

recieved item and it doesnt work missing parts as well dont think i can keep buting from amazon

they wont stay on the mode i put it or whenever i try to have it on 1 color it switches without me even touching the remote.

I hate the fact of how the desk is only like 19‚Äô in width. Definitely not worth the money. A literal waste at that. I really want to return the product but I already set it up. I do not recommend buying the product‚Ä¶ I WANT A REFUND -_-

This thing showed up late, no big deal‚Ä¶ until I saw the box that looked like it was thrown down a mountain. With everything inside broken and bent ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So i sent it back. Wish I knew about the leg room to leave a review because a lot of people said they‚Äôre happy with that üòÜ

Product damaged on arrival.  Missing parts/nonconforming parts. No support from Manufacturer. Amazon wanted me to disassemble, repack and return, which was impossible without wasting more time and money.

I didn‚Äôt like the item , and after a return they didn‚Äôt give me a refund . It‚Äôs been over 4 weeks and I haven‚Äôt received my money . Very unprofessional and highly don‚Äôt recommend buying from them !

Don‚Äôt buy this product. It came in a busted up box that was taped multiple times and all the hardware was in ziplock bags because it was USED when I was told and paid for a brand new one. It has multiple water spots on it,is missing many hex screws,no instructions or Lights and remote aren‚Äôt with it. Don‚Äôt Waste your money

We bought 2 of the desks, one has a good set of lights with a nice remote and the option to plug in via USB. The second one is totally different, no USB option and only a handful of colors on lesser quality remote.

I got this desk to replace my older one but the desk showed up and I quickly realized I made a mistake. It is cheap, flimsy, small in every way and just overall looks like a $70 desk. You‚Äôre essentially paying an extra $130 for led lights and a power strip.

I bought this as a gift for my grandsonAfter taking all the parts out and putting it together one section of the desk fell apart! I tried to get a replacement part but the company was no help!! The absolute worst customer service ever

The box came damaged and with that corners of the desk are damaged and the led strip lights that were sent with it do not work.. I replaced the battery with a brand new one and still nothing..  I spent a lot on this desk for it to not work and it was a Christmas gift for my son.. very disappointed..

Missing parts order for Christmas and opened up today and return closed 3 hours ago. I am screwed. Most products have a bigger return window or time frame.

I saw many reviews about the desk coming with broken pieces but hoped for the best. Alas, my fear came true. One of the pieces came cracked. Tried to reach out to the manufacturer but was given the cold shoulder. Going to return via amazon. Buyer beware.

One of the supports was bent and made it VERY difficult to get the screw holes to align and the LED's were just flat out broken, like they don't work. I'm super upset....

The power cord worked about 2 weeks and burned! Can't use the led lights on the desk now. Defeats the whole purpose. Wasn't worth the price for a particle board desk.

My daughter loved this desk when I gifted it to her, its been 2 weeks, lightly used and its already coming apart at a nonstress spot !!!

One hit of the knee and the whole desk moves. Had a ceramic pot sitting on the desk that fell off and shattered within a week of using. Not stable at all.

Desktop came broken on the corner, and had another huge scratch across the middle. Was super excited for the desk, sucks it wasnt packed well.

Hard to build up a birthday present when the item is delivered missing some parts

Missing two pieces (#10) & (#15)very frustrating having spent that much money on something and not getting the full amount of parts.I get it‚Äôs not major but it‚Äôs annoying.

After owning this desk for a bit, I have a couple gripes. First, trying to use the middle as my primary monitor is troublesome. The bars make it impossible to scoot my chair in. Basically leaves you 2 options. Either you face left side or right side. My second gripe is that the monitor shelves are flexing under the weight of my 26 inch monitors. Looking back on it now, I think I'd opt for a higher quality desk due to the weight of my monitors. The led strips did better than I thought they would and have remained adhered to the desk. They are super cheap lights though. Many colors on the remote don't work, and attempting to dim the lights results in them turning into a strobe light rather than dimming. Durability and cleaning are good though.

I didn't get many pics of this desk, so forgive the mess. Also, I purposely only used half of the shelf since I have a desk arm that clamps to the surface.I only used this for about a month and a half, but only because it took me so long to get a new one. I would say this desk is okay if you're only using your computer casually. I noticed almost immediately that its not very sturdy, and it is probably only sturdy if its completely against the wall (I tightened all of the screws as tight as I could without breaking something). My computer monitors would shake when I type. I also had issues arranging things properly due to the height of everything and the width of the tabletop. I could not wait to get rid of this desk. Don't waste your time if you're a heavy gamer and/or have a demanding setup. I tried, against my better judgement, and it failed me :(

After getting the game desk all put together putting on finishing touches plugged in light strips. They didn't work only half worked. No way to contact seller. Amazon said all they can do is put in for a pick up and refund. Really can't reship broke peice. üò§

On the edges of the desk the carbon fiber sticker is all flared up or discolored and gaps in desk and sits uneven. It's not flat. And most screws won't tighten all the way making it wobbly. Some screws didn't fit because paint was in screw holes making it too small for the screws to fit in. Other than not good quality color is cool

Easy to assemble. It took me a little over an hour to do alone. There was a tricky screw that took a while to get without the extra hands. The K piece seems ideal for a foot rest until you put your foot on it. The desk is sooo small. Which is my bad bc I read the length as 50‚Äù but the working space is 31‚Äù. I would NOT recommend this purchase at all. The two tiers are not functional bc there isn‚Äôt enough working space. I play pc games too, so my guess is that it is ONLY for gaming. So then maybe it‚Äôs a solid buy for kids‚Ä¶the again, kids have homework so idk. It‚Äôs just super small. Which is interesting bc when I made the purchase, there were two options for size, the 50‚Äù being the bigger of the two. Now it‚Äôs gone. So‚Ä¶ two stars bc it‚Äôs not functional but super pretty. the third star is being offered in the same way the empty corner space is measured - in ‚ú®spirit‚ú®

I have been using this item for less than 6 months and the power outlet is no longer working, contacted customer service and they are refusing to provide a resolution.

The box came damaged and with a lot of tape. Corner of the table was also cracked, i ordered the same one but will be returning this one

Definitely not made for long term. While building this the top layer snapped while only walking it over to the main desk to connect the two. Not the quality I was hoping forIt came with a few scratches already and some spots you can see under the paint because it‚Äôs a thin layerDisappointed for sure

Directions absolutely sucked!  Took a few extra days to get to me which it is a Prime item. Missing the cup holder. Have not contacted anyone for this matter yet. Took me and my son 3x trying to figure out the directions on how to put this together. I would not buy this again.

I ordered this desk and it arrived a couple days ahead of time which was fantastic, and the box was in perfect condition. However when I opened it and had taken almost everything out, I noticed the 2 desk top pieces were broken along the same corner on both pieces. Its horrible that these arrived in this condition, but the worse part is I cannot get in contact with the distributor to get the broken pieces replaced. It looks like a great desk and I had another one that came a few days earlier that was perfect. The lack of contact to get the pieces replaced shouldn't be this hard to fix. I'd love to say this arrived perfect, but in the condition that it arrived in, its useless.

Got it all put together with some confusion, but I was able to sort it all out, once I was done with it, I found that the leg room is pretty non existent. I was hitting my shins almost immediately. If i attempted to turn I was hitting my knees. It really needs a better leg support design. I aslo found that when fully assembled it seemed rickety and weak. The table top is thin and could be bigger. The best way to improve this product would be to either position the leg supports further back, or increas the depth of the table by a few inches.

I ordered two of these desks and received the ‚Äúnew‚Äù version and ‚Äúold‚Äù version. The new one comes with an expanded LED remote the sensor sticks to the underside of the shelf and doesn‚Äôt seem to generate a lot of heat but the old one the colors are off and get quite hot after just 15 minutes. These ones are set the the basic purple color that both remotes have but the new one being more blue in color and the older one being more red. If just using for strobe or a primary RGB color they just don‚Äôt match up just right.

I was very excited about this desk. It has the electric outlets and nice carbon fiber. However, it has quite a few flaws. For whatever reason, the packaging was crap. All of the styrofoam is ripped up and jacked up in the box. So many pieces and flakes were everywhere and not really protecting the desk. Sadly it has a dent mark on the top middle shelf üôÑüôÑ. That‚Äôs not the best part. I was ready to set up the middle shelf, but the holes don‚Äôt line up. That got me really triggered. I never had issues building up furniture. Just after setting it up for two hours!!! Most of the screws are hex and I don‚Äôt agree with it. So it‚Äôll take a lot of time setting up.

Weak particle board can't handle weight from even the monitor. All planks bow as soon as any weight is put to them. Two of the top monitor planks buckled under the weight of a 10lb monitor. The power strip has already lost both usb as well as 2 of the 4 plugins. Luckily I may be able to salvage the frame and rebuild the desk using stronger materials. Do not buy this if you are expecting it to last.

This desk is very small and the monitor stand is super skinny.  It also does not put the monitors far enough away from the keyboard area.  I would not trust this desk top to stand up to any kind of monitor mounts.  I will fix it by ditching the top and making a custom top out of marine grade birch plywood of a proper size.  Only buy this for a child.  Even if I had bought the larger version it is only a few inches wider, not deeper.  I probably should have thought about it more before purchasing.

Great size but came with lots of scratches, broken pieces, and missing screws.

Sold me a desk tried to put it together for Christmas doesn‚Äôt have any screws

The screws for starters, have a hex key shape to them but they send a screwdriver that doesnt fit in any of the screws. The holes for the screws are bent and not cut cleanly by any means meaning I have to bend them for the screws to fit. The material is cheap and not very sturdy, the fact I put back a $99 dollar desk similar to this for this desk because I was hoping for better quality deeply disappointed me when I found out how cheap this desk is. It's pathetic they price gouge like they do...

I had to use many screws of my own to get this thing together since the ones they sent didn't work but after hours and hours getting it together it seemed to be decent. Then a few months in the lights started going out and one or two turn a different color it looks bad. I've contacted customer service about replacing the lights but still no reply

Package arrived in poor condition, not the sellers fault. After inspection only a little damage to the corner piece of one piece. After assembly is completed and then plugged in I find that one of the LED strips is not working. The desk appearance really should not be described as carbon fiber as it is basically black on black and does not give the appearance of carbon fiber. The desk sturdiness is very shaky, I would not trust putting a pricy monitor on this setup like the photos used. Overall I am highly disappointed.

I had this desk for a bit over a year.  While moving and putting back together the fitting ripped out though.  Was a solid feeling desk but don't count on being able to move it at all.

If this thing was a $100. cheaper, it MAY BE somewhat worth it. Easy to assemble but, the poor facsimile carbon fiber finish is more of an insult than anything, and don't fall for the fancy-colored LED tape lights that you can find next to the $5.00 DVD bin at WalMart. Spend a little more time in your search, and you'll find something a lot better! This thing is horrible!

I loved this desk at first. But don‚Äôt expect it to hold a monitor for long because I‚Äôve had mine less than a year and it busted into 3 pieces. Loved the pink, loved the design, however please work on the construction with not so cheap hardware. Thanks.

Arrived a week late. Damaged before I even pulled it out of the box. Holes misaligned. Don't trust the top shelf with your monitors, my shelf buckled under its weight. It's cute, sure. But it's cheaply and poorly built. Would not recommend to any adult needing it for work. Kids will love it though!

so I received the deck and built t up some on the hardware was corroded and the joints did not match up i fixed it my self but I would say that you make sure the product is fresh luckily i have the ability to fix the problems.

The holes on the desk didn't line up so we had to get a replacement. Frustrating to have to haul a heavy desk back to ups. The replacement is better and getting together ok. It isn't a very sturdy desk. But my kid likes it so that is good enough for me. Amazon was quick and shipped our replacement very quickly.

The quality of this desk is very poor.  My desk top cracked when I stood up and pushed back in my chair. I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this product. The features are great,but it does not last I just got it in February and already can't use it anymore.

The box was strangely light. After seeing the poor quality of the contents, I'm not even gonna bother putting it together. Cheapest possible mdf. Metal components are feather light. This would not last 2 months with boys. This did not get 4.5 stars. Amazon. You are lying to us and we see you!!!!!!.

Product arrived with scratches and marks. Overall it‚Äôs cute but wouldn‚Äôt exactly recommend. Company wasn‚Äôt very helpful when I reached out.

I‚Äôve had this desk for a few months now and my issue is that the middle part of the desk was not measured properly. I have to constantly try to fix it only for it to fall apart every single time.

Get a straight desk if you are tall not a corner desk. The supports in the middle jam into my legs

This is a photo of the pile of metal and press-wood that should be my assembled desk! It even scraped my leg as it crashed to the floor during assembly! I've highlighted two of the screw-holes that disintegrated when it fell apart!

Product came scratched out of the box luckily my son didn‚Äôt care too much but for what I spent on this desk and for it to be damaged i am really disappointed

Had 3 of the long screws missing so I am going to use superglue to hold the top part on‚Ä¶ led strips are a bit short but they‚Äôll work.

It may be hard to see but it is chipped all along the top of the desk. For a almost $200 desk that shouldn‚Äôt be a right out of the box issue. This is as good as trash

I've never hated putting a piece of furniture together more. Written instructions instead of just pictures would have been awesome.

First off the box was terribly damaged and the desk was damaged also I‚Äôm not 100% satisfied at all

I like it a lot but the box they ship it in was destroyed and filled with cheap styrofoam

didn‚Äôt even last 3 months with this table & it already cracking and warped.. now i‚Äôm afraid my computer setup is going to go flying one day ..

Came with a broken pice of wood.was little difficult and time consuming to assemble.Not very sturdy for heavy stuffs

Cheap materials, no leg room, no monitor space, just not a good desk for gaming. Waste of money.

I got a cracked remote with desk for led lights. Not very happy It came like this. I want a refund. I should have gotten it like that or send me a replacement remote that goes with the desk.

I got a broken remote can i get a new one sent? Plz help hate to pack this whole desk up so i can return for a diff one... just to get a remote

Very poor quality, stuff came scuffed and damaged, two of the three bolts for the rear of the chair are poorly threaded and stripped bolts

Too expensive of a price for pressed wood...I would not have purchased it if I had known that.

Assembled but the lights don‚Äôt work and the remote don‚Äôt work as well‚Ä¶ smh

So I‚Äôve had this desk for about 6 months now. It‚Äôs was absolutely beautiful prefect and amazing desk. Unfortunately when moving we had to take the desk apart! Only problem with that is the lights and separation the bottom of the L. We also lost screws and you have no way of contacting them for replacements.

its been a year. i hate it. desk is not as sturdy as id like. the metal bars under the desk in the corner area are in the way and i hit my knees on them constantly. absolutely will be switching in the next few months. i have had it with this desk. i do not recommend it. i feel it is a waste of time and money.

I originally purchased this desk because of the LED lights under the raised shelf. After assembling the entire desk I went to install the lights, only to find that there was no outlet to connect the lights to the desk. I received a small refund to compensate, but it does not make up for the fact that the reason I was interested in the desk is now not available to me. Disappointed.

Just put this together and the weight of a 6 monitor stand with monitors attached started to bow the desk very badly.  Had to immediately cease using this desk and go back to my old one.

Honestly the table is great and super sturdy. As the picture shows the power cord adapter is cracked. When I first reached out to Amazon they told me I had to reach the seller/manufacturer. I was unable to do so. The second contact with Amazon got me a phone number and the link to the seller/manufacturer, which does not work.Again I love the table and it is very sturdy, so far it is still my favorite addition to my game room.

I just thought, the way it showed in one of the pictures, a printer on the desk, the same printer i have, it would be able to hold the weight. It doesnt. Beautiful desk. Im gonna have to figure out how to reinforce it, so that it can hold up to everyday use, though. And recently, the people who sell this desk have come out with an upgrade freaturing under desk shelves for the gaming tower, and a tray for the keyboard. As such, rather than reordering this desk, i would hold out for the upgrade instead. I would give it 5 stars, if, because they upgraded, and are even selling the upgrade for the same price, if they sent me the rest of the peices they added to they upgrade, being as i had ordered the same desk, but no, they list it as a different desk. I am handicapped, and will have ro order my own underdesk keyboard tray. What happened to good old fashioned quality, and customer service? Hell, if they sent me the other parts they added to the upgrade, i would order the additional desk, with the upgrade, anyway!

If you like having your stuff fall off the desk and into the corner, then this is the perfect desk for you.I didn't notice the ridiculous design until after I put it together, so, its my bad, and I can't send it back.The purple color is nice, exactly what my daughter wanted, but it does get scuffed up easily.Relatively easy to put together, took me (the mom) about an hour to put together solo without power tools. Seems sturdy enough, time will tell...But seriously, what room is this designed to fit into? Its advertised as a corner desk, but leaves a triangle the size of a dinner plate just wide open in the back. Makes absolutely zero sense.

It‚Äôs nice, looks a lot bigger in the pictures but is solid at least. Mine is missing a few screw holes so I can‚Äôt attach the monitor stand properly or the corner piece to the desk ,so maybe have a drill handy.  it was hard to put together. But it‚Äôs ok. Not bad for $110 on sale I think.

I bought this as a Christmas present and when we finally opened it to put it together the top part and the foot rest were not included

I bought this L-desk since I needed it for my gaming PC + my work from home PC so I have a single desk for both. It was fairly easy to assemble though it's not designed for actual vesa monitor mounts if you fully assemble it with the rising shelf.My roommate and I had to drill a hole in the riser shelf in order to have the vesa monitor mount properly fit. Though some people in other reviews mentioned this came with small monitor stands when mine did not. No big deal, but I figured I'd point that inconsistency out.

One of the parts was broken. Over all It still looks nice just had to use lots of super glue to hold the broken piece.

Well the desk is fine and dandy. The instructions are not clear how ever. Had to take apart certain things to put them correctly in. Not only that the shipping issue. I live in a apartment and I made sure it is sent to mine that I stay at. And they dropped this off 10 apartments away. And the thing is heavy. And also as I stated instructions and delivery. Both of those are why I gave this a three star. Please make sure their sent to the correct address because I don't know about you. But a 200$ desktop at a apartment that isn't mine. Could have been stolen. And I don't think I could have gotten a refund because of that. Please work on that issue and fixing the instructions cause it didn't Clearfie alot of things. Having to keep unscrewing and rescrewing is alot easyier than screwing and unscrewing my wife. But still having to do that because instructions aren't deatils as how things need to go a certain way. Please fix. Peace out.

Amazing desk but the strip lights didn‚Äôt work

It's not the best desk, but for the price, it's not bad.I bash my knee on the metal support rods below the desk all the time because they're right in the way of the corner of the desk. It's not the sturdiest desk, it wobbles enough when I type that my monitor shakes. The only reason I bought this one in particular was the extra shelf that goes along the entire top side of the desk, I like having the extra space.

Very difficult to put together

This gaming desk had great detail for assembly with parts well labeled. This was a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son. He is thrilled with the look of the desk Mostly due to the shape and the led lights. For the price of this item,  I was disappointed to see that the desk top is made of very thin mdf covered in laminate. The total thickness of the desktop is only half an inch. I also purchased a gaming chair on wheels, and a small bump by my sons knee caused everything on the upper shelves to topple over. It is not at all sturdy and I can‚Äôt imagine this desk will last very long. I would not purchase this item again.

Product came with bumps, scratches, and a few parts where the wood had come off entirely in small chunks. the stickers are terrible and thin, and tear away so easily i couldnt even pull them off the paper they came on without ripping them. ASSEMBLY WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. instructions were so unclear about where to screw and how to lay the table so that you didnt have any backwards or stray rotated pieces. not impossible to do alone, but oh so difficult. the rgb lightstrip had a terrible smell that almost knocked me out, and barely stuck. but it works well for now.this is a good desk(with some cons obviously), but shouldnt be priced so high. leg room is decent and the surge protector inside the desk is a big help as well as the raised secondary desk, but that doesnt add $60 to what is a $120 dollar desk.

It wasn‚Äôt hard to assemble. Just took a couple of hours because of all the screws and parts. The material looks a bit cheap and doesn‚Äôt have any weight to it. The carbon fiber design looks nice, but it smudges so easily. I have very dry hands and somehow there are fingerprint smudges all over the desk. If you have an expensive monitor, just be careful because the table is rather unstable and the monitor seems like it‚Äôs going to topple over. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a cheap desk, so you really get what you pay for. Overall, it looks cool, but the quality is a bit lackluster.

This desk is cute you can‚Äôt deny it, however it‚Äôs not the greatest quality. I‚Äôve used the wrong screws putting together furniture before and the worst thing to come from it was not having the right sized screw for another part. Used the wrong sized screw on this desk and it cracked off a quarter sized piece of the pink top layer on the desk(I don‚Äôt mean it pushed up and frayed I literally mean it cracked OFF). It is all particle board so it‚Äôs very light weight but it seems sturdy enough with the metal legs. The power strip doesn‚Äôt work, wasn‚Äôt given enough of the #2 screws, LED strips work fine. Also came dirty/discolored in some spotsTLDR cute desk not worth the price, get a cheaper desk and paint it yourself. If you get this desk make sure you use the right screws because you will damage the desk my grabbing the wrong one. Also have a spare extension cord on hand.

I've had this desk for about a month and a half. I really like it, but I was a little disappointed by how wide it is. It is very difficult for me to understand proportions without actually seeing the object in front of me because neurodivergence is fun. So I was expecting it to be a bit wider. It's still a nice desk, though. That being said, the LED strips blinked and died last night, the day after I took these pictures. I'll have to find a better lighting option for the platform.The desk is good, but don't expect the lights to work long.

The monitor stands don't fit my 38 inch widescreen gaming monitor or my 32 inch gaming monitor, MAX is maybe a 27 inch monitor, 5 inch wide monitor stand area just doesn't work for larger gaming monitors. The tables a little small for a gaming table, more a( laptop desk with dual monitors desk compatible with 19 to 27 inch monitors)depending on the legs of monitors. . So to call this a gaming desk is a stretch.

Easy to setup. perfect amount of space for my uses. One PC 3 Monitors.My only beef is the damn led strips got stuck on blue 2 days in and wont change anymore. ive found zero info online on how to fix so id suggest if you buy the desk then buy a better quality led setup for yourself.Other than that i def got what i paid for i cant complain about the rest of it.

So this was my first gaming desk to put together. Little did i know the thing would be a wobbly mess, I have two 32' monitors that when they was sitting on it and i would bump it moving my chair closer, both monitors looked like they would fall over, also the allen nuts sometimes would lock up mid turn, which i had to redo alot, but for the non active person it's great.

Its a good functioning desk, but if you add a dual monitor desk clamp with more than 10+ pounds of weight into it, it will snap the piece its clamped onto. Luckily, my gaming monitors are perfectly fine, but so far, I've snapped 2 pieces of this desk off already. As for everything else, the desk is very good, easy to clean, easy to assemble.

I've been trying to call and email but I can never seem to get through. I don't need to return anything and that's all else Amazon let me do. Part of the desk corner came cracked and we tried to contact tonget a replacement part to no avail unfortunately. Its a beautiful desk, will be working wonderfully as a gaming desk after we reinforce that corner with some epoxy. Just a little disappointing it came broken

The media could not be loaded.
                



Good table but doesn‚Äôt come together all the way in the middle, it leaves a little opening. Another thing I noticed is the paint already chipping and I haven‚Äôt even had it a full month yet, overall I love it

The desk isn‚Äôt very sturdy for my gaming set up with a steering wheel.  I also have my set up in the bend of the desk.  The support limit leg room, however after banging my knees on the supports a couple times, I know to be more careful when sliding my legs under the desk

Not sturdy, and not much room under for legs and I'm 5'3. Also not deep enough to hold the whole monitor screen on the lift. (The stand to monitor hangs over). Nice that it has the plugs built in. Decent for the price.

I‚Äôm actually pretty sad about this. I bought it as a Valentine‚Äôs Day gift for my husband and it came with the corner broken, we would return it but due to us being overseas mil it‚Äôs just difficult.

The desk is great and very easy to assemble. Half of the lights went out after two days and they were barely used. I wrote the company and haven‚Äôt gotten a response or acknowledgement email. That‚Äôs a little disappointing, but will probably just get my own lights for it.

Very easy to assemble looks great but feels cheap and the supports are positioned in just the right place to wack your knees... if it was about 70 bucks cheaper it would be a great buy.

It‚Äôs not bad. Could be more sturdy and have a bit more desk room. But other than that it‚Äôs pretty great.

Short version: Easy to set up, decently sturdy, biggest compliant smaller than expected.Even with the longer version, the amount of available space is small.Partially my fault, was looking for a cheap desk with a monitor shelf, this is fully a desk for a teenager or child.

Dislike  it is cheaply made and not sturdy.

The desk is awesome. The cheap led‚Äôs it comes with are not. If I have the lights in and I use my tv remote to change the volume on my tv it‚Äôll either change the color of the lights or turn the lights off. But other than the cheap led‚Äôs the desk is great

Everything looks great and good quality but I didn‚Äôt get any of my screws to put it together I look at the instructions it looks simple I just can‚Äôt get my hands on the screws

Its awesome, great desk. Would have been 5 stars but arrived damaged and didnt want to wait for a replacement. One of the corners is an underside so you cant see it but the other one is visible.

I like the desk, it's got alot of room, but the LEDs were a big selling point for me. The remote stopped working to change the LEDs or turn them off. Emailed support and got no help.

Okay desk maybe you can find something better for price. I do like the power supply it has built in to the table

Everything was fine until i turned the LEDS on and realized the whole left side was burnt out and the remote didn't work. so now they're just stuck on green unfortunately. Just be prepared to buy your own LEDS with this desk.

This corner desk is super cute, and it was really easy to put together on my own. It feels pretty sturdy, and I think it should definitely hold up well. Having the built in riser is really nice, and so is the built in extension cord.I deducted one star because of the strip lights. They‚Äôre kind of weird and don‚Äôt work well. I‚Äôm actually thinking about just removing them, really. The way you have to go through the color options is so odd. There are a few presets, and then you have to manually go through the in between colors (which are still limited) like you‚Äôre flipping through tv channels. They also just‚Ä¶ randomly turn on by themselves? Always on red? Which is especially annoying since this desk is in my bedroom.All of that being said, the lights weren‚Äôt the main reason I bought the desk, so I‚Äôm definitely still happy with it! But maybe plan on buying your own lights separately if you really have your heart set on that lighting.

the desk is a little bit wobbly but overall good! it took me about 30 minutes to set up and i‚Äôve never built anything before! very easy to clean off if something gets on it! my only complaints are the wobblyness and the bars in the middle under the desk. i like to sit criss cross on my chair and have my monitor in the middle bit instead of the sides, and the bars make it uncomfortable to sit. thats just a me thing though, as i know the desk literally wouldnt be able to support itself without them lolol but overall great purchase!! ive had it for a year now and those are my only complaints!

My favorite colors are pink and purple. I wanted a kawaii setup, and this reasonably priced desk became the centerpiece. The box was heavy, but I was able to take it up a flight of stairs by myself. I don‚Äôt like putting furniture together, but I am okay at it. I am 29 years old and was able to do it by myself in about two hours, but I did take a few breaks in between to stretch. I accidentally put a piece on wrong and had to unscrew a few things. The directions say not to tighten the screws until all pieces are together! If you seem to be missing a hole in the desk, try looking at the diagram very closely. Other than that, I actually really liked the drawings. I think a little text would help the vast majority of people though. The RGB is a strip that you stick onto the back of the desk and must plug in, and it comes with a little remote. You can set it to one shade like I did (purple) or have it change color. You can also control the speed and brightness of the lights. The power strip is something you have to screw in and also plug in, and it comes with 3 standard US plugs, and two USB-A plugs. I think this is a really nice feature, and the middle placement is an excellent design choice. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on carpet, but if I slightly hit the desk, it does wobble. Things don‚Äôt fall off or anything, but it does make me question if the desk will hold up over time. I have my PC on the middle section and feel slightly nervous it could fall off. I am thinking of putting it on a tower holder instead. If you have a monitor that seems to have a large base, you might run into the same issue I did. I really love the built-in risers of the desk, but I wish they were bigger since gaming monitors these days have absurdly large bases. You could solve this by purchasing a table extender or using a mount instead. I am so thankful they included headphone hooks and a cupholder which are interchangeable if you prefer them on the opposite sides from the photos. Despite the wobbling and skinny risers, this desk looks really cool and will be so much fun to use!

This l shaped gaming desk is really nice it‚Äôs carbon fiber on all the wood surfaces has led light. It‚Äôs also a really good height. I‚Äôm happy with this purchase

I bought this desk to finally set up my gaming rig, and it sure didn't disappoint. Three monitors (1440p, 2 1080p) mounted side by side on the upper level are no problem, nor are a Saitek X-52 FCS and RailDriver controller on the lower deck. There's even room for a router and a laptop and then some. This desk simply has room for almost anything you can throw at it.The LED RGB lighting is a major plus, as it gives a nice ambience to an otherwise drab room. The cup holder and the headphone cradles are a nice touch as well. These allow me to not clutter up the desk, freeing up work space. Another huge plus is the included power strip. This lets me charge my phone without taking a wall outlet or USB port from my computer. Possibly the biggest plus is the vertical expansion of the desk, with its two levels. The lower level is the work level for keyboards, mice, controllers, etc., and the upper level is for monitors and speakers. This is very efficient design.There are a few drawbacks that prevented the fifth star, but these shouldn't be looked at as dealbreakers. This desk is still very much worth the price, so if you're like me, a guy who regards four stars as a don't-buy, don't be like me. First, there isn't a ton of space under the desk to fit a computer. This really isn't a big deal unless you built a behemoth of a PC like I did. Stupid me. Second, the upper level isn't very deep, which prevents larger monitor stands (such as those that come with MSI 1440p monitors) from being able to fully rest on the upper deck. And third, if you're like me and plan to sit facing the center of the desk, the center is constrained by the 90-degree angle formed at the center.The above issues were rectified by 1) putting the computer behind the desk, 2) purchasing a clamp mount to hold the monitor, and 3) by using scrap wood to make an 18-inch isosceles triangle to fit in the center and mounting it with shelf clamps. No big deal.Overall, this monitor is well worth the buy. I'll upload pictures once the entire setup is complete.

This is absolutely my fault for not looking at the specifications before buying, but I really thought this looked a little bigger in the pictures. It's not too terribly small, just smaller than I thought. I love the risers for my monitors and the built-in power cord the most, though. The optional-to-install drink holder is actually way sturdier than I expected it to be. I've bumped into it several times and it just holds strong. I've only used lidded tumblers and bottles in it, but it manages to keep them from spilling even when I knock into it. Your mileage may vary with open drinks and cups.FOR MY PEOPLE WITH LONG LEGS: I bang my knees on the two bars in the middle of this desk CONSTANTLY. I don't know why they put those bars there like that because I've had many L-shaped desks without this issue, but it's annoying. Every time I do it, everything on my desk shakes and stuff falls. It's the only thing I hate about this desk. It's just not long-leg/bouncy knee friendly. So, keep that in mind during your desk search.Other than that, I could see this being a fantastic desk for a kid, teenager, or young adult. Definitely a great "entry" to gaming desks. I love the included light strip that lets you pick any color glow. I love the upward storage of the shelves and how it opens up my hand and arm space. It's the right size to be able to work on my desktop monitors on one side and then turn to write or take notes on the other side. This desk has a nice surface area for working from home and online classes, without taking up a massive amount of space like most L-shaped desks do these days. It would be great choice if you wanted something to tuck into a corner in your room that gives you enough room to multi-task if you need to, or it's got enough room to show off all your cool collectibles while you do your thing.The reason I say it's a good "entry" desk is because you're going to eventually want one of those bigger L-shaped desks for more space and storage. This gets the job done well enough for a time. I see myself upgrading in a couple of years, but for now it's perfect for what I need!

I love the desk - it's exactly what it looked like when I ordered it.Assembly was as easy as furniture assembly typically gets.  No complaints there.The only issue I had was with the LED lights.  I followed the directions, plugged it in, turned it on, picked a color, and was delighted.For about 10 minutes...At which point the lights went out and the center power unit looked like it just about melted.It wasn't enough of an issue to reach out to the manufacturer, but it was disappointing.Otherwise, no complaints.

I really to love this desk. I wish it was a taller but it‚Äôs does the job.

Very easy to assemble, done by one person in under an hour. Light weight but sturdy - I have a PC, back-up battery (I swear that thing weighs more than a car battery), & 24" monitor, etc. on the desk portion which adds quite a bit of weight. The carbon fiber look is nice and none of the pieces were damaged/scratched. The instructions & hardware were nicely packaged, and it came with an actual screw driver! Not just an allen wrench. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is for the fact it didn't come with the LED lights nor the remote...

This is a good little desk, my teen daughter loves it. Its compact yet roomy, fits well in the corner of her room to allow for more space saving and is  covered in a light pink film that is carbon fiber printed. It is not made out of carbon fiber, its compressed wood with a contact paper like covering from what i can tell. It is not as bright and bold as the photo shows in normal light. It only looks that bright when you are using the LED strips. It is decently sturdy for the quality. It holds my teen daughter's 28" gaming monitor and her 32" TV and playstation with ease and she can even do homework on the lower level without having to move around her keyboard and mouse. Theres no slot or shelf underneath for a tower so it sits on the floor. It took 2 people roughly 45 min to an hour to put together. Lots of pieces and you will need the extra hands. It would be a mighty big hassle putting it together with just 1 person. The instructions were pretty clear and thorough. The only complaint i have is the lack of shelving underneath for a tower and the price. I paid $200.00 for this desk, but at times I wish I would have saved myself around 100.00 and just bought the exact same one that didn't include a cup holder, headphone holder, power strip or the LED lights. It is a nice little touch to add those features to the desk, but 100.00 more costly. My suggestion to the manufacturer would be to sell an option that has just the desk without the add-ons (it wouldnt cost much to include a plastic stopper for the hole where the power strip lays) and sell one that does, or do something where you can pick and choose which additional options you would like to come with the desk.

Good quality, relatively easy to put together. Larger than expected.

The desk itself works perfectly for my room and is great for my current set up. However the desk is not sturdy and is quite flimsy, I built some supports for it to sure it up and get it more solid

This desk is so adorable, and so spacious! I can easily fit two 27" monitors and my mid tower on the top rack, my work laptop right below the tower case, and plenty of extra space on the side for snacks, notebooks, and other miscellaneous things. The top rack isn't really wide though, and the bottom part for my vivo stand sticks out a few inches, but it's not bothersome at all to me. I never notice it. The desk is pretty stable! I love the feature of having a headset stand and a cup holder SO MUCH, because I always had to throw my headset on the table and it always annoyed me. Also having a designated space for my cup is extremely convenient, so I never have to worry about knocking over my cup with my elbows again! My only other complaint is that I can't fit my usual gaming pad where I'd like my keyboard, so I might have to buy a new gaming pad specific to corner desks.The construction of this desk was easy for the most part, except for the last part of installing the top rack. It requires you to be below the desk in order to put the screws in, and every moment was misery, but at least once that's finished, you can enjoy all of the hard work you put into it. Then all that's left is to decide where you want the LED strips! I chose to have mine below the desk, because the lights were too bright for me to have below the top rack.All in all, I thought  this desk was completely worth the money, and it really brings the set up together! It looks complete, even though I haven't gotten my new case yet. Super glad I finally decided to purchase this desk!

I really love the fact that this is great to place in a corner. The lights underneath make it pop a bit more and the remote (battery included) you get is really nice, plus it reaches pretty far too! I like the coating laminate that‚Äôs wrapped around each of the wood pieces. It makes the whole thing feel sturdier with the metal reinforcements. I‚Äôm very lucky mine came with all of the parts and a few extra screws just in case you lost or broke one. The directions were fairly simple and made the process fairly simple to put together.Overall, I would say the desk is fairly sturdy. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have a metal brace going across the back underside of the two longer table pieces. I don‚Äôt forsee it breaking unless your putting slot of weight on it.However, I‚Äôm one of those people that are accident prone, so I am definitely more cautious about resting anything other than my arm on it. I‚Äôm still happy with my purchase and I think this is a great deal for any one who needs a good quality desk for a decent price.

Super cute desk! The setup was super easy. The only thing I‚Äôm a little disappointed in is the corners/sides were dinged up with scuffs so I wish there was a little more protection when shipping. The other thing is the stickers they put on to indicate what part is what, did not come off easy and left a lot of residual stickiness left over. However it‚Äôs very sturdy and a lot more space than I thought it would be! The color is very cute but a lot lighter than the picture so be aware of that!

i LOVE this purple desk i‚Äôve been wanting it for the past 3 months , i ordered it a couple days ago and just finally put it together today when i noticed one of the legs are bent. it may be small but it‚Äôs still very noticeable . other than that everything else came out nice.

Nice desk. Really enjoy the lights. It was very easy to set up solo. I was surprised how small the box was upon delivery but all the pieces were there. Just be warned that the top longer shelves will bow under the weight of a heavy monitor. Additional support brackets for the middle of the long shelves should be incorporated by the manufacturer into this desk.

Perfect if you‚Äôre looking for a more cute deskVery spacious and true to color. Led lights are also a perfect touch to the look of the desk. Only thing is if you do have heavy things on the desk a part of it will kind of bend and make a part of the desk uneven.

Im not the tallest person on the planet by any means but if you are to sway your knees left or right be weary you may end up with a bruise, other than that the desk is amazing

love the desk for my husband but leaving 4 stars because the remote control to the desk was missing and I have been trying to reach out & haven‚Äôt gotten any help

My teenage daughter is just like her father with her passion for online gaming. She couldn't stop talking about how amazing it would be to have the extra surface space, the room for 2 monitors, and the color-changing LED strip lights with multiple settings. She saved the money herself for this desk, and we helped her assemble then put it into place. I have to admit, compared to her other standard desk, this one is a marked improvement. Not only does the construction afford a more open view, but now she can have 2 monitors side by side at an appropriate height to encourage good posture and prevent the neck angling to look down. She also has ample surface space for her notebooks on either side of the keyboard and mouse. I really like that it doesn't have the crossbars underneath at the support to prevent the stretching out of legs as needed. Instead, the bar is flat on the floor with no obstruction. It isn't quite what she ultimately wants, but it is definitely a step in the right direction, and we are all happy with the end result.

We now have two of this exact desk. Easy to assemble, durable. Works great with a gaming PC and as a desk for our 3d printer and cricut.

Perfect for my thirteen year old son.set up was easy. Not the sturdiest desk but my son doesn't need a heavy duty bulky desK.

After I ordered this for my grandsons birthday I was later told there was a delay and given a new arrival date, then just before that new date I was told they may no longer have it in stock. I held on and waited a couple more days and they then said it was shipped out. I did get the gaming table a day before his birthday. It wasn‚Äôt the easiest to put together but the instructions were good and didn‚Äôt take that long to assemble. Two screws for the power outlets were missing, but it fit in the table tight and after telling the seller they sent me a box of screws. None of those were the exact screws but I was able to get one in. The price couldn‚Äôt be beat, similar tables cost at least $100 more, you couldn‚Äôt find anywhere a gaming table with all the features like this one for that low of price! My grandson uses it everyday, he likes it and I am happy it all worked out. It‚Äôs actually a nice design and sturdy, plus it has all those other features you only find on a more expensive table!

It's cute! If you get the pink, it is much more of a baby pink than the picture shows. Alone it took me about an hour to set up(instructions are pretty clear but I still managed to put on a few pieces backwards) also, some of the holes are not drilled out all the way so I was not able to fully secure all of the pieces (the triangle that connects the two sides of the desk from the middle) but it is still holding up okay after a few months. the extension add on w USB plugs is super handy and overall I am satisfied

The packaging was good and the item was undamaged. All parts were accounted for with a few extras. The desk was sturdier than I expected considering the reviews. I think its key to tighten all the screws one final time after flipping the desk. Its ideal to have two people to flip the desk after assembly in the upside down position as required. Everything works so far after set up and the LED lights are a little nicer than other sets we bought with soft rubber cover over the LED vs exposed. My only complaint was the instructions. They are pretty lame and don't mention the stickers or the wire clips. Also they are not supper clear on the leg orientation and be sure you put the legs on with the extra holes in the strut at the bottom or you will have to undo a lot of work.  Overall for the price, I would give it a solid 4. Would give 4.5 if that was an option.

The monitor shelf could have been a bit wider not all computer monitors fit on it other then that i love it

Smaller but still serves its purpose

It's great for the price but I wish I would have gotten the 58-width desk instead I wish it came with a floor stand for the pc

Overall I don‚Äôt love.. or hate this product it just.. does it‚Äôs job. Overall the legroom if you decide to sit on the V center of the desk is kind of rough as the 2 support bars are right there. Also the support in the V center of the desk for monitors is slightly lacking as there‚Äôs only 1 support towards the back end of the top shelf and not one near the front so that‚Äôs slightly a worry as I have to have my monitor there. I will say the added power strip is a nice feature with USB ports. Also note the little LED strips don‚Äôt come attached you will need to attach those yourself. Overall‚Ä¶ I think this just gets a 3.5 stars from me. As I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôa that strong or sturdy it could home some weight sure. But I‚Äôm afraid to even lean on this thing and break it. I‚Äôm not mad at my purchase and enjoy it but it definitely could be better!

Have this desk for a decently expansive setup.  Have three monitors and they fit great.  I do have pretty expansive setup and everything seems to fit decently.  There are only two things I've noticed with it that I don't like or find perturbing.  First is that there is a wobble.  The desk seems structural sound, but I do notice a wobble in my monitors.  I am on a carpeted floor, so that might be the issue, but my previous desk, I did not have that issue.  The second issue I had was the built in power strip seems unusable.  I went to plug something in, and it seems like the right vertical slots have something blocking the insertion of the plug.  Not really a huge issue(I mainly just want to use the USBs for charging), but it is perturbing me.  Overall though, the desk seems structurally strong and fits the needs I have for it.

Pretty solid desk for the price. Wanted something that could fit my three monitors for my pc and a tv for other things. It fits it all pretty well. The only downside is the top shelf is a little narrow. You can see with the first pic the stand hangs off a little. Also the desk seems a little less sturdy than I‚Äôd like. Slightly moving the mouse or typing on the keyboard you can see all the monitors swaying. It‚Äôs not horrible but is slightly disappointing. Other than that it met all my wants so I‚Äôd recommend it.EDIT: after a few months I‚Äôve really noticed the lack of leg room. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and my legs hit the support bar at the bottom of the desk fairly frequently. Still happy with the purchase but it gets rather annoying.

Overall it's a very good desk, made well and I got all the parts in the original package without the need to call. Once I put it together, my only issue was it stood uneven. Like the leg was too short on one side. And during assembly I did have an issue finding some of the screw areas, but a flashlight solved that problem. My cats jump on this desk every day and it stands strong. My monitors may wobble when they do, but my coffee doesn't splash.Final verdict: worth buying. üíØ

It's not the fanciest desk in the world, but it does what it says it on the tin and it looks real cute, which is what I asked for. Considering how cheap it is it's a great deal. LED lights look good, too.

Size is as advertised, but not nearly as "big" as I'd hoped.  Not a lot of real estate to work with on the monitor riser in my situation. (can't put the tower on the floor where I am, so it's eating up shelf space.)Leg room in the center is nil due to the supports there, BUT the thing is rock solid sturdy and gives me a lot more room than I had for all the things that tend to clutter my desk.Once I figure out a solution to the PC tower issue, I'll be able to set up a triple monitor set up with the 27" curved monitors I have.

I know the running joke is woman can't build things for themselves. Which I won't lie and say I haven't had my slow moments. With that being said the direction are so beyond confusing. I would suggest adding worded direction and not just unclear pictures

Awesome looks good

The only reason it‚Äôs getting 4 stars is because there was fiberglass everywhere, it is extremely bad to breathe and touch that stuff. If you don‚Äôt know already fiberglass is worst than any sliver you‚Äôll have. Not only that but fiberglass being breathed in is even worse,  look it up.Besides that it was extremely easy to assemble, if you know your alphabet you‚Äôre golden. No words just pictures with amazing details. They even give you all necessary tools you need. A pretty high quality allen wrench along with very nice bolts, and an actual screw driver that‚Äôs worth keeping. No screws stripped. It all pieced together better than anything I‚Äôve ever bought.

I am so in love with this desk!!! Although it is 4 stars because one of the led strips ended up not lighting up so only half the desk is lit. Not sure how to get a replacement either üò≠Otherwise, this desk is very cute and is very sturdy! I wanted to buy this sooner but it became unavailable, so I waited for it to come back in stock! Worth the wait!Update:I've disassembled and reassembled this desk about 3 times now and still holds up well! One of the things you put the screw into has come out but with some glue, easily fixable. But this desk has been through so much and if anything does happen to this desk, I would not hesitate to buy this again. I am in love ‚ù§Ô∏è although, one led didn't work, and eventually the second one also just stopped working but that's fine! Am still so happy with it ü•∞

This desk is super cute and was very easy to assemble.  Would be 5 stars but the remote didn't connect to the LED strip even after going over those instructions over and over. Really bummed it's just going to stay having red lights. Hope the seller could message me and help me out with that.

Primary leg of the desk came damaged from shipping, so I contacted customer service and they immediately sent out another complete desk. They even let me keep the original desk, so now I have 2 desks minus a leg.Pink color is super cute, not sure about durability with regular use yet but it feels pretty solid. Not bad for the price and amazing when a company has good customer service. :)

I am new to this whole gaming PC thing and I wanted a nice gaming desk to hold all of my devices. Right now I have my Mac on one side and my gaming PC on the other. I also needed to be somewhat compact because I didn't have much room in my corner. This fit perfectly, just follow the pictures on the instructions and set up will be a breeze. I got it on sale for about $80. Not bad at all. Contruction is good. LEDs are a nice touch.

Very nice quality, easy to put together.

I love how easy it was to put it together.Fits the gaming monitor, Hp desktop, printer and other stuff. Def the best for the price!

Got this for my new roommate and he's on this thing ALL DAY EVERY DAY. It fits 3 of his consoles, his gaming laptop, and TV as well as some of his manga and anime figures and it really does light up.Only complaint is that it is VERY DIFFICULT TO SET UP and I had to call someone to do it because neither of us were able to after 3 HOURS of trying...

Easy to install and I just loved the way of it looks in my room 2 big screens and a laptop can easily fit in

Very pretty color, easy to put together took about 45 minutes, exact size I wanted good for small rooms too

Great product!

Its a perfect and easy set up. Great corner display. Nice size. Nice shelves.

Nice gaming desk. Good value. I would recommend. Perfect set up.

Sturdy desk for the price. You do want to put it together in the room you want to put it in if you have narrow hallways. We made that mistake and had to do some Tetris moves to get it in the room we wanted it in! It‚Äôs heavy enough to not be rickety, but it‚Äôs not so heavy that you can‚Äôt move it.

Sturdy desk, well built, good material, doesn't feel wobbly at all if assembled correctly. Lots of space as well, I am even thinking of having a third monitor and get the pc down and there will be plenty of space for it. RGB works fine. You would expect more functionality on it but for the price it is totally worth it.

I absolutely love this desk!! Stability is great and is perfect size. Nothing was missing, everything was present. It was really easy to put together, the alignment is also good! Definitely would recommend this desk to everyone!

Exactly as the product description. Had no issues in the setup. Great quality overall.

It came with a scratch, but that was the fault of the delivery man who simply threw my order at the door. However, the table is beautiful and I love it.

Very good desk, for my needs I will buy again

Very easy to put together. light easy to move around but sturdy !  Lights and outlets are üî•

Excellent service! In just one day I have it! I‚Äôm in full love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Very easy to put together, especially if you have carpentry experience, I love the lights and it's options with the remote, and the power strip with USB plug ins it came with. Perfect, beautiful, and very sturdy, highly recommended, especially for what I paid for it!

Great

Loved it. I built it by myself while my 2yr old was playing with all the parts, I managed to built it in less than 1 hr. Good quality and no missing pieces for me I actually got extra pieces.

I'm absolutely obsessed with this desk. I've been needing a new desk for a year but wasn't completely sure yet. This desk was exactly what I was looking for. The installation was super easy I mean I got home from work and did this in less than an hour by myself. I'm so happy with the final results. And the carbon fiber wood makes it look super sleek. It's vary spacious and I have room for not only my games on one side but also my art. This desk is super comfy to it just gives a nice feel to the room not too big or small the perfect size.

Worth every penny!! Definitely should buy it!!

Perfect size for son‚Äôs room.  Easy assembly and great price:quality

This is my first gaming desk and my first time building one I built it backwards but it stills works lol. I really do love this deal and it makes gaming easier and is also really comfortable so I feel it deserves 5 stars

I ordered the desk on 12/15/22, received it on 12/27, and I believe it was shipped by the seller. So a bit of a delay getting the desk (it was around the holidays, so that may have played a part). When I originally received the desk I scanned the contents for any broken parts, based on the reviews, and didn't see any at the time. It took a few days to get the time to put it together, but on 12/31 I removed all the pieces from the box and realized that I did, in fact, have a broken corner piece on Part C (the largest desktop piece). However, the desk is made from particle board and we all know shipping companies really don't give a crap about our deliveries so I would say one drop from someone that hates their job did it.I contacted the seller via their customer support email address which I found in the instructions, and to my surprise they responded 6 hours later on a Saturday. They couldn't send the single part to replace it and instead sent an entirely new desk which I could use for spare parts. The new desk arrived 1/6/23 and was in perfect condition.SELLER MADE GOOD ON MAKING IT RIGHT.The desk is VERY easy to assemble. I read some had problems doing so, but I put the desk together by myself, and I followed the instructions perfectly. If you're somehow "punching through" the desk when screwing things together, you're using the wrong part. If you can follow instructions, not tighten your bolts until the end of the build, you'll be fine. Flipping the desk over is easy if you take your time and can lift the weight, or have someone else help to carefully help you flip it.The RGB lights aren't exactly perfectly measured for a short side and a long side (both are the same length and match the longer side). Line these up before hand and make sure you're sticking them where the metal supports aren't going to interrupt the placement and also where the power base isn't going to be pulling.Great desk, good seller!

Super great gaming desk! Easy to assemble and looks super clean. It works perfectly in the corner of the room I needed it, does not take up as much space as I had thought it would!

Perfect setup 4 my room

I saw this desk on Amazon and thought it would be a great addition to my room, especially because of its reasonable price and how cool it looks.I was a bit skeptical about the quality but I did change my mind after receiving it.Estimated delivery was December 24th but it got here on the 20th (I ordered it on the 17th.)The unboxing process took a while since every single piece was bagged and protected with styrofoam, but it was worth it because it had zero damage from shipping.The assembly process was pretty straightforward with very clear instructions. It did take a while to assemble but that was because I took my time with it and built it with care (I recommend doing that to avoid mistakes that might ruin the final result.)The desk turned out better than expected and the quality surprised me. It comes with shelves, a cupholder, headphone mount, 4 power outlets, 2 USB ports and LED lights which are all really good quality. For this price range, that‚Äôs more than I ask for.TIPS:Before buying:-Check the dimensions to make sure it fits in your room (or get the smaller version).-Clean up your room and make space because you‚Äôre gonna build it upside down then flip it.When assembling:-Make sure to accurately follow the instructions. The manual comes with 2 different assembly plans, A and B. Make sure you‚Äôre following the correct one to avoid later trouble.-Do not fully tighten the screws until the instructions tell you to.-Do not over-tighten the screws. This could damage the table and decrease its sturdiness.-Attach the LED strips to the bottom of the shelves before adding the shelves to the desk.-Take your time while building the desk. Do not rush through the assembly process. I know it might take a while but it‚Äôs worth it to get the result you really want.That‚Äôs all I can tell you about this desk. If you like how it looks and its price then I‚Äôd recommend buying it.You‚Äôre welcome!

Firstly, I‚Äôm not one to normally write reviews. but considering this desk was so simple to set up, i figured i would! When i received the package I was a little afraid some damage occurred because the box was a little ragged. But upon opening and inspecting beach piece, i was overjoyed to find all pieces in good shape.All the pieces were there, and they even included spare screws, a Phillips screwdriver and an Allen key for assembly. The directions were very simple and easy to follow. All the pieces had not only pre cut holes but also metal inserts pre installed for the screws to guide into. All in all the assembly took about an hour with just using the tools provided. There was also a hook provided for headsets or cords as well as triangle cord guides with sticky adhesive includedThe RGB cords were a little short so you‚Äôll have to keep them closer to the corner of the desk rather than the edges. They aren‚Äôt the super cheap strips either, there‚Äôs multiple modes to the lights and you can set solid colors such as the one in the picture.Once it was all assembled i placed my 32 inch monitor on the top and though it barely fit, was still stable. The desk is perfect for a beginner streamer and gamer. The only complaint i have is the height, you may need an adjustable chair.Leg room is decent. Though the width of the desk is a little small, the back side isn‚Äôt blocked by a wall, so if you‚Äôre okay with moving the desk a little away from the wall, there won‚Äôt be an issue.Watch out for fibrous material. the carbon fiber will need a wipe down when you set up. Though personally i didn‚Äôt have an issue with itchy skin, I‚Äôm sure someone willAll in all this desk is really impressive, they really thought of ease of use in the design. Though it has it‚Äôs one small legroom flaw, it‚Äôs very ergonomic and sleek. They definitely had gamers and general users in mind.

Very satisfied with this thing.  Easily put together.  Easy to clean.  Fits my needs perfectly.  I have enough space to do a dual monitor with laptop in the middle, the docking station, a mac mini with screen, and switch with dock and screen.  Still plenty of room for all my peripherals and notebooks, etc...

Easy to assemble.  Instruction were clear for the most part. Only complaint I have my tower barely fits.

This desk is amazing. I ordered it on a Thursday and I received it THE NEXT DAY. Very fast shipping smooth transaction. The desk was easy to assemble, instructions were very brief and straight to the point. I bought the purple one I love it it‚Äôs amazing I‚Äôm going to buy my daughters the pink one next!

I ordered the 50‚Äù carbon fiber one. It comes with the tools you need which is an Allen key and a screw driver.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble individually. For $99.00 I thought it was pretty affordable so I went with it. The metal does seem a bit cheap however I‚Äôm okay with that. Sometimes the cheaper items hold up the best. Overall it fits the aesthetic I‚Äôm going for with my game room and I have no complaints so far. I will update this review in a few months to disclose if all pieces are in tact and if it holds up or not.

Seriously loving my setup it‚Äôs perfect for my gaming area

This bad boy has been in my living room for just about 2 years. The lights (if you handle them right) have lasted as well, no bulbs, or whatever these tiny ones are called, have gone out. Just make sure you don't put too much weight on any of the middle sections.The only issue I've had so far (and it was because of me) was when I leaned on the top section and it cracked slightly. I've since put up a stack of my books to support that section, and all is well.Essentially, just make sure you do the setup right, watch where you lean, and you have yourself a solid desk that looks awesome.

I bought two of these so that my daughter and I could put them back to back in the corner and game together.  Desk went together very easily and rather quickly.  It isn't going to hold heavy object on the top shelves, but it does fine with 32" wide screen curved monitors.  I do wish these desks came deeper though, I would prefer a 30" deep desk with the top shelves being a little deeper as well.  You aren't going to have a nice underneath unless you figure out how to hide all the PC wires and cable, but there are other options you can get to tidy those up and mostly hide them.  Been about a month now and the desk top and edges are not damaged in anyway, so they are pretty durable.  My daughter and I use a 3D printer and print a lot of stuff and we carve and sand the items coming off the printer on our desks and so far, no scratches or damage where we have been working.  The middle legs need more curve, my knees hit them often, but my daughters do not.  So for bigger people it can be an issue, but I find I sit off to one side a lot and it is rarely a problem.  But over all great desk for the price.  Delivery was awesome, they arrived on a full size box truck, the driver knocked on door, my wife was home and he asked her where she wanted them since they were kind of heavy.  She showed him a spot and he put them there.  Boxes arrived in a great condition, no damage.  So happy with this order and if you game and your kid does, two desks make a nice corner gaming area =)

When I tell you I just put down my J to write this review, I mean it. I‚Äôm going into my new WFH job tomorrow and this go around I decided to finally put me an office together instead of being hunchbacked at my dining room table again which prompted me to go to my trusted Amazon to find what I really wanted. I thought about getting a little cheap one until the time came when I could go all out but I said to double hockey sticks with it!!!!! I‚Äôm going all out, chair, desk, printer, the whole 9!!! I originally came across another desk that looked very similar except it didn‚Äôt light up and the reviews said it crumbled when being flipped over‚Ä¶my mouth dropped. I picked my mouth up and continued browsing through L-shaped pink desk and I stumbled across this beautiful creation. It took me about 1 hr or less to put this together. I am a 27 y/o single female so it wasn‚Äôt too much of a hard task. When I got to the curvature of the legs I had to use my hands and feet to tighten the curved foot bar but that wasn‚Äôt a hassle but it did make me turn on the ceiling fan and put the glass of wine down..lol This is my first review and I hope I was as descriptive as possible. As you can see so far I have a lot on my desk and the sturdiness remains the same even on the plush carpeting. I‚Äôm just awaiting my 7ft bean bag, art work and other things and this room in my new place will be completed! Good luck on your search everyone, but I‚Äôm telling you this desk is it!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è  (Random black scratches are to protect my employer and I)

I love it so much it feels so good on another side has more space you can do homework writing stuff reading books whatever that is! It‚Äôs so good!

I was really worried it would take time to make but it really didn‚Äôt. Instructions are clear and the material is pretty nice. Fits in corners and the LED lights are actually nice not the cheap thin strips.

Perfect fit and beautiful color change

Missing pieces, holes don't align, and is annoying to assemble. Not worth the money.

Whoever packaged this, truly did not care. Some of the pieces were not numbered, I believe I was missing a tool, but most importantly, it appears somebody screwed in the slides wrong, and just left it there, so the screws fell right out of the slides when I picked it up, and they did not fit anymore. I was able to find some screw that sort of work, although I had to loosen a lot of the pieces, so the drawers could move in and out freely. Idk how long that fix will last, but it shouldn't have been necessary. I would return it, if I already didn't spend 3 hours trying to put it together. Not the first time I've had a problem with this furniture distributor, but I wanted my new furniture to match. The electricity works, and I think it would've been an alright dresser, if it didn't come defective. Hopefully, I can find a vendor that sells the same color for the rest of my furniture, because I don't recommend this one. They also put all the numbers on the outside of the dresser, which I think is kind of annoying too.

Beware of cheap hardware needed for assembly!I removed all parts from box, placed them up in order and began to assemble Step 1. I was to  use a a Philip's head screwdriver. The first two screw heads quickly stripped. It was NOT operator error. Those were the first two of many to use for assembly. If they stripped quickly what's the point of continuing? So I am returning the unit for refund and will look to another manufacturer for a similar item. Returning is a pain. I have to repack all the parts in the box and hope I can get them all in.

Very disappointed. Took about an hour to put together but the drawers don't align. Can't get them to close all the way. Will be returning

Screws B didn't fit into the holes drilled in product. I'll be returning, but it's incredibly frustrating that garbage like this is still sold online, wasting time and forcing customers to be responsible for the process of correcting the issue. I bought because of good reviews but based on several that match my experience, it's clear there's no quality control from this seller.

Thus thing really is a joke. It's just tiny & seems like doll house furniture more then an end table. The drawers are tiny & only about half as deep as the actual end table. Your not going to fit much of anything in them more then a remote or two. Just not what I expected for this kind of money. They should of offered a set of two end tables for the price they are asking. The amount of assembly for such a small thing just makes this a completely bad buy. If your looking for actual storage better keep shopping as this will not do it for you. I feel cheated for sure.

I bought this table for the end of the couch in a narrow passageway. It was perfect and I loved having a table with plugs right beside me. However, one night I plugged in my tablet and sparks flew from the outlet!!!! I unplugged the table right away and have not risked plugging it in again. I emailed the company, as instructed on the Amazon site, and I haven't heard a word. So now I have a table that I can't use to plug in my devices. Amazon always makes my purchases correct, but this company didn't even respond. So disappointed and I will NOT be buying anymore of their products.

I had high hopes for this little table. Had lots of issues. The seller worked with me and issued a full refund.

I don‚Äôt know if all these reviews that say it‚Äôs easy to put together are lies or if the one I got is defective, but I couldn‚Äôt even put the first two pieces together. No matter how hard I pushed, the screws would not go in all the way.

Bought one and the drawers wouldn't go in straight but once in wouldn't come back out so returned for a replacement. Replacement came and had the same issue with the drawers on top of a drawer bottom being too long so the drawer front wouldn't sit flush to the sides. If the drawers were not such a flaw it would be a solid End Table but I am not impressed at the defectiveness and the fact once in the drawers will not come back out. Bad design!!!

Missing holes for screws on last step‚Ä¶tried to have the part replace and they wanted me to take the whole thing apart and send it back‚Ä¶I‚Äôll just try to find someone who can drill holes‚Ä¶other than that everything fit perfectly‚Ä¶

If I had known this had to be assembled, I would not have ordered it.  I have assembled it twice.  Drawers would not open.  I have taken it apart for the third time.  Will attempt to reassemble one more time.  If unable to do so, I will add to trash pile.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.

Package arrived in great shape and was well packed! Every piece was in great condition! Having some where to be I quickly began to put it together, stopped and finished later. Then it dawned on me how large the top was, measured and it was 11.5 inches and not the 9.5 listed on the description. I ordered based on measurements to go in a tight space.What does XL,L,M & S mean in Chinese? Not a darn thing!!

Doesn't matter how I set it, it doesn't line up. Board 9 on the instructions isn't lining up to anything it's supposed to be with. So that's why it gets a 1 star review.

Nice looking , easy to assemble . However , both drawers had a flaw with the tracking and they don‚Äôt go in correctly . Had to force it and they both didn‚Äôt work correctly . Nice little table though .

Don‚Äôt buy from this seller. They refuse to refund. Item did not fit in my space, never opened it and they still wouldn‚Äôt return it.

The table is nice and works for what in need as far as storage, the plug is useless. I contacted their (the manufacturer) customer service (per the manual) as I had already put it together and nothing. They promised to look into it and... nothing. So I paid for a table and a non working plug.

Comes in so many small parts with even more Styrofoam to match. All the screws come in tiny bags you have cut open and they're not even the regular cross screws. The pictures are also misleading since the width of the drawers are 7" not 9.5"

This will take you all day to put together. Instructions are not well written. For your own sanity, look somewhere else.

Stuck at 1st step - pre-drilled hole from board D does align with connecting pieces. Have to put everything back and return

Power cord broke after 2 months, outlets no longer work. Complete wast of money given the only reason I bought it was for the outlets. Amazon refuses to replace the power cord. Buy with caution.

This product is a total waste of money.  First of all, there were several screw holes that were not drilled properly.  The particle board broke apart during assembly.

China Junk!  Impossible to Assemble.Hundreds of tiny pieces.You need to spend hours putting it together!Not happy!

I never got this product but I ordered another one by the same manufacturer and it was great. Easy to put together and very durable.

Missing parts and the drawers break easily.  I am returning one of them and I would tell everyone to avoid this product.

This might be a very good nightstand, but what they sent was a rubber rug. So I have no idea if this is any good -

Poor quality! I had to glue the face plates on the drawers to get them to stay together. Very disappointed!

Power strip worked for about 30 seconds then stopped working. No power when plugged into outlet. Yes, my outlet works.

Probably the worst furniture I've bought off amazon. Very dissatisfied with my purchase

Want to be refunded for bith

We got these tables as a wedding registry gift, we haven‚Äôt even had them two months and they are pulling apart. We are now out tables and our wedding guest wasted money on tables that are already broken. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again or reccomend.

Decent table but the USB ports stopped working, and the company refuses to replace.

The instructions when putting on the legs is backwards (had to spin the cabinet around)  and the knob came with no screws trying to contact sellers but asking for pics and order number which they tell me is not validBS i will be giving then a week for my screws that it is going back assembled or not, missing parts or not.

This was inexpensive and I thought I would be covered buying from Amazon, but the quality was terrible & couldn‚Äôt assemble using the supplied parts - had to go buy my own screws and try to assemble because the only option to return (free) was to take it to a drop off 60km from my home - they did respond to my email inquiries but didn‚Äôt make sense to return unless I pay and it is still poor quality furniture. I will be careful to avoid this seller in future and read the fine print. Wayfair is a safer bet for online, cheap and cheerful furniture. Lesson learned.

This is the worst product so far, it was missing screws, holes weren‚Äôt drilled, and it was scratched, looks like item had been a return because bag hold screws was ripped open and inside of bigger box all over,

The unit looks nice enough, and was not difficult to assemble.  However, the bottom drawer is misaligned and will not close.  This is not an assembly issue, but a problem in production - the holes are not drilled symmetrically.  I would return it if it were not incredibly inconvenient to disassemble the unit and package it for return.

I purchased 2 grey end tables and I actually love them, especially the color.  I do have to say I'm very disappointed that when I went to look for a coffee table in the same color to match, there is none.  They only sell a light grey color, so now I have two end tables and no coffee table to match.  They can make a book self the same color but not a coffee table.  So if your looking for a full coffee table and end table set DONT order the grey in these shelves you will be disappointed.

Impossible to assemble as manufacturer did not drill and install the bolts in both sides of the panels.

Nice table but one of the legs is crooked making the whole thing look lopsided.  Purchased two and the 2nd one does not have this problem.

Do not buy this product or any product from this company. I purchased this product and the top broke after less than a year of use. The customer support was very unprofessional and refused to replace an inferior product.

Missing parts board ends #10 two pieces

Just started putting this together and on the first step I run into the channel for the drawer being cut at a ridiculous angle. How am I even supposed to fit the bottom in like that? Absolute junk.

Received the item without screws to assemble the table. Contacted Rolanstar as suggested by Amazon but they won‚Äôt give me the screws because I bought the table from Amazon.Like‚Ä¶what??Product seems sturdy but one really need screws to make a table.

Routered side on piece 4 off by a few mills so couldn't even screw it into piece 7 and get the bottom to fit in it.Very disappointed, I have bought a lot of rolanstar stuff and I've never had it go together so poorly. 0/10 would not purchase this unit again

Hardware missing and not able install. Too many part

The drawers in it were broken. Had to completely take it apart after building it to return it

Very poor quality product. Thing started to break during the assembly. Boxed up the item best I could and returned to Amazon. The cardboard box item was shipped in is built better.

The table itself is sturdy and easy to assemble.The powerbar that comes with it stopped working after 3 days... And it doesn't look like a common length either so I can't buy one at the tech shop.

Dowel holes are not sunk to correct depth. Unable to use the dowels. Drawers are difficult to insert. Don't bother trying to contact the seller; they don't respond.

This may very well be a nice piece of furniture when assembled - IF you can get it assembled!  The tiny little allen wrenches they supply are worthless and even with regular screwdrivers I couldn't get the screws in.  I'm no novice - I've put together plenty of these little furniture pieces.  The return shipping on this worthless pile of parts and pieces is $16, although that's on me.  I should have read more closely that it was free shipping but didn't say "free returns."  So now I either have to pay the return shipping or find someone who can help me put this thing together.  Two morals of the story here - #1 always make sure it says "free returns" and #2 don't think you're going to be able to assemble this out of the box with what they supply.  Good luck!!

It‚Äôs a decent item but the drawer pieces were NOT cut properly and holes did not match, had to put it together without screws and glue them. Good enough for what I needed but not an item I‚Äôd put in the living room.

Almost perfect for my space and needs. The problem is that the imperfection is, shall we say, concerning. This sits between my bed and the chair where I knit for hours. Sometimes, as I am knitting, I hear a soft fizzing whistle, like when you open up a shaken soda bottle just a little. It took me a while to pinpoint its origin, it‚Äôs so quiet. I have now determined that it‚Äôs coming from the plugs in the table.So, 10 out of 10 for form and function, but minus several million points for maybe killing me in my sleep with an electrical issue.

This table came and initially I was intimidated by all the pieces in t?he box. Wasn't hard to assemble just took time. About 90 minutes. The wood seemed very strong and table seemed solid. That was until I was done assembling it. I was sitting on the floor assembling it. Now I have 1 leg and weight 120 pounds. I placed my hand on table top to steady myself to get into my wheelchair. Barely put weight on it and the table top exploded. Turns out the nice strong wood was actually particle board with a nice laminate on it. So I ended up falling onto the floor and taking a screw driver stab right in my perineal area. (Also known as my taint) Thanks God it didn't go to far in and stopped bleeding pretty fast. Needless to say I'm far from happy, and I lost the money I spent on table 5 minutes after assembling the table.

I ordered 2 of these tables.  One of them I assembled just fine and I really like the table.  Assembly is pretty easy, it just takes time.On the 2nd table, Board 3 was not pre-drilled with holes so the table can't be put together.  I've contacted customer support so we'll see what happens.

I was super excited about this end table because its perfect for where i need it, but the drawers dont align properly and you have to mess with it to get them to both fit.

The product itself is nice, was exactly as depicted.  My problem though is that they sent me 3 of one part and only 1 of another, which I needed 2 of each. I contacted Amazon customer service and the manufacturer directly and still have no resolution.  It's been over two months since I purchased it so returning it isn't an option.

My dad and I had a hard time to put this together and some of the screws didn't seem to be correct and we will have to use some wood glue and filler to fill in the holes made by the screws.  Cute concept but cheap product

Ball bearings from sliding drawer track came busting out when assembling and installing drawers, never had that happen before, little bb‚Äôs all over the floor pretty much..

I am giving it 2 stars because the one drawer cannot be assembled due to inaccurate cuts for the bottom of the drawer to fit together. You can see in the photos how it doesn't line up. If it did, the end table would be nice. Currently only have the one drawer assembled and need to see if they will send new parts

Took forever to assemble- screws stripped easily. Cheaper fake wood than the cheap fake wood furniture I've bought before. Drawers don't close right- and this wasn't my first furniture assembly rodeo.

Love it! It‚Äôs light and obviously not really wood, but so cute in my leaving room:) love it!gave 2 stars because charging station stopped working

Table looks nice, fit nicely next to my chair. Pull knob for one of the drawers would not screw together. Sent email to manufacturer with no response back. I'll have to go buy knobs from hardware store to replace.

I like how this looks but assembly was tedious and the drawers are unstable. While putting one of the drawers in place, a piece of the fake wood cracked and peeled off. You get what you pay for but I wouldn‚Äôt buy this piece again.

Very difficult to assemble.  Also, I did not do it right but now that part of it is partially assembled, I will use it as is but the drawers are useless as the front pieces could not be attached.

Drawers do not fit properly and is definitely NOT worth the money paid for it!!!!

lots to do to gget together

I got this so that I could just use up one plug in and charge my phone and other random electronic.. and also plug in my lap or other thing... but I was so disappointed to find out that these aren't fast chargers! If I'm playing on my phone while plugged in, I actually lose battery on my phone.What a waste... if I didn't already spend the 45 minutes to put it together, I would return it. Without the fast charging, it's just a wasted bumpy space on an other wise nice end table.I do like the drawers (even if they're not super smooth), and my cat likes to lay in the middle shelf space. It also does clean up well and doesn't shy away from harsh cleaning chemicals. It was also easy to assemble, the instructions were very clear and they give you extra parts. You'll need to have a screw driver available though to complete this assembly (not included).In the end... I'm still using it for an end table (basically because I cannot afford another one at this time), but it's there unplugged and I'm still charging my phone in the wall. :(

I really like the look of this side table, easy to build but the outlets stopped working after 3 weeks. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought this specific model if I had known that

cell port dont work  on the table

Ordered two of these, the end tables themselves I really like, they were easy to build and very functional for my small space. I am just bummed that neither of the cords for the charging stations work.

Drawers faces never tightened, they are loose and are about to fall off. Complete  junk. Don‚Äôt buy.

Item was stuck in transit an hour away.  Drawers don‚Äôt close properly after installation.  wood dowel went through.  Too much of a hassle to return.  Sound the best I can with it for now

Updated: the white pieces for the USB port came loose. It‚Äôs cheaply made and we could have bought something else for the same price that had a little more quality.One of the screws for the knobs was stripped. We ordered two tables and only one was like that so now I have a side table that I can‚Äôt use one of the drawers.

I may have misread about this.  I do recall seeing ‚Äúone piece‚Äù.  NOT.  Still in box, no one wants to tackle it.  Way too many parts.  What a waste of money!

Rungs on the inside to house the drawer did not work.  We still have had no reply from the manufacturer on this.

This unit is made in China, and is the second, and last thing we will buy that is made there. It is not easy to put together and in the end the drawers and not easy to open and close.It is even too much of a pain to take apart to send back so we are keeping it.

Sturdy but drawers do not fit well

There was 2 number 2‚Äôs only suppose to be 1. No number 4 piece. One rail was not attached after I screwed it back on came off screws to short. I did improvise and get it together but not worth what I paid for it.

This table met all of my expectations, except for one.  The power outlets and USB unit does not work. With both the power outlet and the USB ports, the power flickers on and off.  Disappointing.

USB ports not working

They way the panels line up when you put this thing together are all skewed. Cheap materials but it doesn‚Äôt look too bad once all together. Can‚Äôt imagine it will last long with heavy use. Couldn‚Äôt be bothered to return it but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth $150.

A talented individual spent a couple of hours putting this together but no way do the drawers or work.

Overpriced.

It‚Äôs ok , cheap made . Aggravating to put togetherThe second was much easier to put together because I had already done one .

Biggest problem is the drawers are short! I saw one for less than half the cost of this that had short drawers but bought this one because as best I could tell the drawers were about as long as the table. Not so!Looks pretty decent. Drawers are ok quality but don‚Äôt slide perfectly. But I‚Äôd be pretty satisfied overall if it weren‚Äôt for the drawers. I wouldn‚Äôt use these in a commercial setting. The first one took about a half hour for my wife and I using an impact driver too (I‚Äôm a rather enthusiastic DIYer too). The second about 17 minutes. So I‚Äôd say the 20 minute for one person is pretty unlikely unless you do this every day.Follow up: they did contact me and give me a partial refund and said they update the listing to be more accurate so I‚Äôm giving it an extra star.

This table went together pretty easily, but the quality is not great. The holes aren't drilled to a consistent depth for the wooden pegs, and some of the other holes didn't line up perfectly. It looks good, and the USB/electric panel seems to be solid. Based on how it went together in assembly, I would expect to pay about $40, not $80.

I finally got my table together. It does what I wanted it for and looks nice when completed. I only gave it a 3 star rating because of parts not mating up correctly. Several of the pieces are grooved to allow the bottom of the drawers to slide in and mate with the front, back and sides. The grooves are not aligned and the bottom does not fit. I had to use a router to align the grooves up. Same problem with the rails not being level and straight. This caused the front of the drawers to slightly overlap so they didn't mate flush in front. With a little work relocating the drawer slides, it now works fine.The table seems very stable and solid once put together. And it looks nice. More attention to production would have allowed a faster and smoother assembly.

First off, every single piece of wood in the box was covered in a layer of what looked like fiberglass fibers. Had to put on gloves and wipe down every piece, on all sides, before assembling. The assembly instructions were pretty standard, easy to follow. Took about 1-1.5 hours for one person, including wiping it down first.My biggest complaint is that the drawers only open about halfway. So anything you put in the back of the drawer will be a pain to get back out again, once things are in front of it. I ended up finding a couple tupperware containers laying around that fit into the drawers, which will help me take out multiple things at once if I need to reach the back of the drawer again.Overall, it's pretty sturdy and works well enough for the job I need it to do, so I'm keeping it. Having the two plugs and two USB ports right on top is worth having to fiddle with the drawers every now and then.

It was easy to put together, but the reason for the three stars is that the drawers don‚Äôt fit in so they‚Äôre flush.I‚Äôd like to know how to fix the problem.

This unit looks nice and feels nice to the touch.  It has a metal frame that seems sturdy and clean looking.  It fits well into small area and right height for my couch.Unfortunately, we have some design and manufacturing problems with both of our units from this brand.  The nice feature of having a built-in outlets is only good if you use only one of the two outlets.  That is because the two outlets are too close to each other, so you are unable to use both outlets at the same time. I am really disappointed in this flaw.  Regarding the manufacturing flaws, the drawer railings were bent or not made correctly.  The bent railings allows the ball bearings to fall out.. These ball bearings are crucial for smooth operations of the drawer.  I had to place the fallen ball bearings back into the railing and use pliers to bend the rails to keep the ball bearings in place.

The concept was great, especially with the additional outlets on the top however, the wood grain laminate and edge banding is incredibly cheap, looking and feeling

The table hasn‚Äôt been assembled yet. I have arthritis in my wrists that made assembly impossible. My adult daughter will give it a try when she visits week after next. If too tough for her I will return the product to Amazon.

I had a cord melt using the outlets on this and almost created a fire. I would not recommend. Hopefully they upgrade this before someone gets hurt.

The stand came together without too much of an issue. My biggest concern is that dealing with their customer service has been challenging. I ordered 2 of these for my living room; one came together without issue, however, the other had holes that were pre-drilled incorrectly and none of them lined up, making it impossible to assemble the drawer. I emailed the customer service team, they responded that they wanted pictures to "see how they could rectify the problem". I sent them the pictures, and I'm still waiting on a solution. The easiest solution is to send me the new pieces that I need in order to finish putting this together. It shouldn't be that hard. Otherwise, they work fine and having the power supplies on top is a great feature.

I give this a star for having all hardware and all pieces numbered and clear instructions.  I give it another star for having drawers with real drawer guides.  And the final star for having a real three-pronged power box (two power receptacles, two USB receptacles).  Beyond that... ugh.  I knew this was not real "rustic wood" for this price point, but the unrealistic-ness of it is disappointing.  It's basically a glossy printed photo of barn wood glued to OSB.  No texture. No attempt at authenticity.  For the price, it's fair.  Not great, not good.  Fair.

Assembly is needlessly complicated by the fact that all hardware required different drivers. None were included.  The included Allen wrenches did not fit anywhere properly and all hardware was of poor quality and stripped out easily.  This made assembly tedious.

It's ok

Ordered two of these. First one was fine but the second one had a defective part and I am unable to finish putting it together. I would recommend these but also hope the manufacturer gets back and replaces the part ASAP because I have a room full of parts now.EDIT apparently replacing a defective part means getting a whole new table sent to me. Now I have to deal with throwing away an almost complete table.

Liked the whole table style.However one drawer did not meet the premade cuts for the drawer bottom, because of that the drawer doesn‚Äôt close properly.Too bad I was really happy with the table it was exactly what I needed.

First day and my drawers on both end tables have broken gliders now I am trying to find a better quality gliders to replace them all. It is really too bad as the rest of the table I like now I have to waste my time and more money on parts to make them right

This table is what you would expect. Relatively cheap but unfortunately it arrived with one of the drawer sliders detached. It must have ripped off in boxing it up so it did not rescrew into the sides as the holes were now too big. We epoxied it in place but it was disappointing.It's also odd that everything is put on with an Allen wrench. Philips head would be better.Overall once it was together it is sturdy and simple and works as expected.

It's good for small spaces but doesn't seem like it will hold up very long.  The screws were cracking the mdf up so we couldn't screw them in all the wall.  Makes the drawers almost unusable. This isn't furniture you could use everyday.  It will fall apart.  If it isn't used often I imagine it will be fine.

The box of pieces is daunting, to say the least.  I hired a handy man to put it together.  It took him 90 minutes.  Fine little table, but the electrical outlets don‚Äôt work at all.

Parts went together pretty well but the front of the drawers didn‚Äôt go well.  It was a struggle and the table won

This product is great and built very well. It's perfect for the space that I needed. Unfortunately one of the stands came with a power station that wasn't operating, it has been replaced, and now I just got up and my phone did not charge all night on the other one. Not a HUGE deal but I could see how this could be an inconvenience to some people.

I got this end table because it had a charging station and the color was nice. Assembly was easy, Until we got to part H which was the charging station... Its missing!So, table is sturdy, I like it, minus the main component is missing!Reached out to the company yesterday, haven't heard back. Order cautiously I guess maybe you get a complete kit.EDIT:Part arrived after an email to the company. Part fits and looks nice.

Love the size fits perfectly in the space. Bought the tables for the 2 usb connectors for charging but they do not work. Disappointed but I like the table.

It charges your phone incredibly slow, but it works and it fits the space I needed it for perfectly. My cat likes to sit on it.

Box arrived in bad shape. Pieces were scratched or broken. Once assembled, it seems sturdy and functional. Seems like I'm going to have to keep an eye on the outlet, based on other reviews. This doesn't need to be a high-end piece of furniture.

The drawer handle came off after having it for 2 weeks. The screw and everything to seem to be fine but when trying to rescrew the handle the nail is too short? The other drawer handle is fine and now I don't have handle for one of my drawer. Cheaply made.

It's nice but normal home humidity is making the pressed wood it's made of expand worse than any other build it type furniture I've owned. Be careful not to even damp wipe it and have it in a dry area not near a window.

Accidently broke the drawer slider on install (my fault) whole thing is particle board and similar to something you would get at Walmart

Electric plug on the end table is constantly sparking whenever I try to plug something in. Not safe so I no longer use that plug and have removed it to avoid a fire or shock. Cheap electrical.

The end table is just what I was looking for size-wise. It was easy to put together and very sturdy. Perfect for my space. The only problem I have is the outlet that is built in sparks when I unplug something so I can't use it.

Bought this for our living room.  Put it in the basement instead because the top drawer is very crooked.  So crooked it does not fully close.

hard to open andclose

It's great...except the part where there weren't screwes for the drawer knobs

Plug stopped working 3 days after setting up.

Usb ports quit in 2 weeks

Not really sure how to rate it. It was a gift. It was moderately ok to assemble from what I was told. Works in a small space.

Unfortunately, I cannot get this thing together. I've tried several times, taking a day break in between total frustration. I'm not a weakling, I'm the jar opener in the house but darn, no matter what I do, I cannot get the screws through the wood to attach one piece to another. I've stripped at least 5 screws. I started stripping two and that's where the GREAT customer service comes in. I contacted them, they sent a bunch of other screws and parts. YAY. But, alas, not with a screwdriver  OR a drill, the wood is so hard every screw gets three quarters into place then no amount of pushing and sweating will turn that screw any more.SO, this useful, pretty piece of furniture is USELESS because it's in the jumble of pieces it came in. It'll hit the garbage once I mourn my stupidity in buying a "simple assembly" piece. Oh and I do have a university education, my father was a civil engineer/house builder ( I've nailed and screwed stuff into a thousand walls) and I assembled all my own bookshelves from IKEA. I'm not inept. But this wood is both woefully hard and the drill pilot holes are too small for the freaking screws.AMENDMENT: we did get it together with help with an assistant, it's beautiful, strong and works beautifully, no problem with alignment of drawers like some have mentioned. We just needed much stronger hands to work the screws etc. It was HARD but worth the extra effort.

3 hra to put together twice because I bought 2 I didn't think of it at the time but having the plugs and USB on the table take up space also you can see all the plug and having no back to the table let's you see all the wires when things are plugged in looks junky

Needed some narrow side tables for our living room, after a lot of research, purchased these. Perfect size, nice to have a couple drawers for storage and shelf for your coffee or drink. We were really excited about having the usb ports and outlets to charge devices however both usb ports of both tables broke after only a couple months use. The outlets still work great but it's unfortunate we can't use the usb ports.Otherwise these tables are great. Have had for a year and a half now and not a Nick on them.

The product looks great when it finally worked properly. First assembly, the drawer wasn't closing, noticed it was hitting the guide rail. I let the seller know, they were great with communicating, sent me troubleshooting videos but that only confirmed the issue: 1 of 4 guides not installed properly from the manufacturer. Seller said they will send me a replacement part.When I got the replacement part, it was a beat up box with beat up parts inside and all the parts in the box were beat up. Only thing that is usuable is the hardware.. some screws and the Allan wrench. So I was still left with a misaligned drawer.I figured it out and the fix was quick. I should have just done that in the beginning before contacting the seller so I wouldn't have recieved extra garbage that I now have to dispose of. The expectation, I guess, was more that you paid well over $100 for it, it should have all lined up properly in the beginning.

What I like:-my cat likes to sleep on the open shelf under the top of the tables, and I'm glad she has her little cave next to my bed-having closed storage is nice for sex stuff/skincare/any medical things you might need for bedtime or waking-having convenient outlets for charging my devices and for keeping our baby monitor charged up overnight has been so nice!What I dislike:-they drawer slider is a bit stiff at closing. Could have been an assembly error but all four of the drawers (2 x 2 units) act this way.-they cords come out of the plugs perpendicular to the wall. This means that if your outlet is behind your bed, you can't keep your bed against the wall.

I was sent two left drawer side pieces so I reached out directly to seller. New part took about a month and a half to arrive and once received the holes were drilled in the wrong spot. Had to fix it myself. Overall frustrating experience. Final product is nice. Customer service was friendly and helpful. But quality control needs work.

The drawer stick on this really bad hard to open.Other than the slow charging, & the drawer sticking it's a nice table.

I would like them include the small specialized Allen key bit for an electric drill including the L shapped hand Allen key they supply. The small sized Allen key for the drill would make it so much faster to put together the endless number of screws you need for this piece of furniture to assemble it. It seems quite sad, but really takes two people, 4 hands at points to assemble it.

One of the draws did not have holes for the screws to go in & we have no drill to do it

The thin tabletop on this unit makes it look cheap. If the thickness was doubled I would give it 5 stars because everything else looks great.

We struggled with the screws enclosed. Some were missing, we needed to go and buy few plus a screwdriver for that type of screws. We struggled......and we had to ask for help. This should not be so hard.......

Assembled fairly easily although you will need a Phillips head screwdriver which is not provided. The table is cheap but you get what you pay for. The reason I gave this low stars is because one of the screw holes to line up the legs was completely off and I wasn‚Äôt able to put the screw in. Additionally, the unit was covered in fibreglass fibres and I opened it on my bed. Now my sheets are garbage. Cheap company that doesn‚Äôt blow off the panels. Be sure to assemble it outside or in an easy to clean up space.

I have low standards for furniture, it just needs to be functional. This end table is a good fit for my room and gives me a convenient place to charge a phone, a tablet, and a wireless keyboard. The outlets are helpful for having a nearby place to charge a laptop. The lower shelf is great for housing a small handgun safe that's hidden low between my recliner and couch, nice and discrete but still accessible.Construction is all right. Usable. Not stellar but seems durable.Assembly was fine. I had it finished in about an hour with plenty of "help" from my cats, so most people can do it faster.Recommended if you're looking for function over form.

Just what we wanted

Takes one person around an hour to build. Pretty sturdy and drill marks were pretty accurate.

Loved it after its together, but what a job to put it together.

Edit: Changed to 4 stars from 3, as the manufacturer got back to me very promptly, and while they can't send me just the one part that's defective, they're sending me an entirely new table, for free, and I don't have to return anything. I appreciate how quick their response was and how helpful they were. Once the new table arrives, hopefully it will have the holes it's supposed to have and I can finally finish putting the second table together.Original:I ordered two of these. The first one, I had no trouble putting together and it's very sturdy and beautifully finished.However when I went to put the second table together, I discovered one of the pieces was missing holes, so I couldn't finish putting the table together. I even tried using my electric drill to drill new holes in so I wouldn't need to send it back, but the wood is far too hard, and my drill couldn't penetrate it.So I contacted Amazon support, sent it back and got a replacement... Only for the replacement to be missing holes in a different piece. I can't get another replacement, and all I want is just for the one incorrect piece to be replaced. I've contacted the manufacturer in hopes I can get the one piece, because I really do like the table and I don't want to send it back, but I can't finish putting it together.Missing holes once is a fluke, but twice? Someone needs to be doing the quality checks more thoroughly. I want to give this a 5-star review, I really do, but I can't. Even if the manufacturer sends me a replacement part, I shouldn't have had to go through all of this, twice.

Easy assembly.  Buy you own Allen wrench,  but if you buy more than one item to . Looks nice and is sturdy assemble you already should have one

Love that it's slimmer for small spaces.  Drawers are larger than expected to hold a lot of stuff

Good solid and easy to assemble.Expected the drawers to be wider but they will do.Good material and assembly hardware.

Drawers, shelf and chargers. Fairly sturdy.

Yes, it‚Äôs cheap.Yes, it‚Äôs light.But it works good enough. It‚Äôs actually sturdier than I thought it would be, so yes, it‚Äôs a decent buy.

I bought this for my RV because of the width. My son had a different color one next to his bed. Very sturdy and color is way better in person then picture

Instructions were clear, and all pieces and hardware were properly marked.  And it even came with a thoughtful pack of spare hardware, just in case.  I was very impressed with the directions and it how quicky it all came together.  However, at the final step one of the two drawer pieces (piece 10, on step 11) failed to have pre-drilled holes.  I attempted to make my own holes using a nail and hammer, but this split the "wood."  I compensated by using superglue to attach the piece with missing holes and it held together.  Not sure how this piece passed quality control, but I was able to overcome.  Still, a bit of a bummer at the end.

Comes with easy install instructions for assembly. It does come with the correct tools as well but is easier if you have power tools. Works smoothly. Only thing is, if it's not put together just right, you will see it looks minorly uneven.

The table seems to be sturdy enough and has spaces for my husband to stash some of his stuff (instead of having it scattered all around him).  I wish it was a longer by a coupe more inches and wider too, but it's suiting our needs for now.  The one thing that was irritating didn't have anything to do with the seller, but delivery through Amazon; we received the shipping email and it gave us a date, saying it would be delivered on such-and such date, but late in the evening the 1st time, we got an email saying it would now be delivered the next day.  The next day we didn't receive it and didn't get an updated delivery email from Amazon.  It finally did come on the 3rd day.

Great, sturdy little tables. I love them. I needed something narrow and practical, and this fit the bill. My only issue is I wish the plugs were off to the side instead of on top of the table, for better cord management, but besides that, these are great and match the other products I've been purchasing with the rustic brown and black metal aesthetic.

It was very easy to assemble and only took about 30 minutes. Just the right size too.

Quick/Prompt delivery, easy assembly with included tools, great price and looks awesome.The specs indicated this was 23.6‚Äù deep so I had hoped the drawers would have been kinda, sorta, maybe close to that. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äî they‚Äôre only about 14‚Äù deep.

This is a great little table.Made of easy to assemble predrilled pieces of OSB with an easy to clean stained wood finish. Hardware includes the black steel supports, all screws, drawer pulls, adjustable feet for leveling, and the power outlet. Tools are included along with easy to follow instructions. The drawers glide easily and are quite roomy. Love the narrow width ~ gave table space to some neglected areas. We ordered a second one, cuz it FITS!

Everything fits and functions well. Overall I like it. The only issue I have with it is the plug is mounted in the top of the table, facing up. Which means any and every liquid spilled on the table goes right into the plug.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand how pouring liquid into an electrical socket is a bad thing.Also with the socket mounted in the top of the table means there is area in the top that can't be used without covering the plug which is impossible with anything plugged in.  My solution would be to move the plug to the back of the table. It would allow full use of the table top and prevent spilled liquids out of the plug.

These are built very much like what you‚Äôd find in a certain big Swedish store.  I bought 4 of these.  The first one took me about 90 minutes to put together.  After that, the next 3 each took about 45 minutes or so.  No need for an assistant, but it would certainly speed things up if a second person assembles drawers.  Don‚Äôt bother with the ‚Äútools‚Äù that come included.  Use a real Phillips screwdriver and hex bit, preferably in a battery powered device.  The screws are decent, but the circular fasteners are extremely cheap metal.  Plastic probably would have been better.  I stripped nearly every one of them trying to get the drawer fronts nice and tight.  The power cords are plenty long enough to reach the nearest power outlet.  Don‚Äôt over-tighten the screws!  You‚Äôll risk damaging the laminate or denting the metal tubing.

Nice small side table. Drawers are smooth. Sturdy. Slightly smaller than I thought, as it appears larger in the photos. So make sure to measure to ensure it is as large as you need it. Good buy overall.

This is a nice table that fits perfectly into the space I had.  HOWEVER, installation of the drawers was terrible.  Everything went well to that point, but, lord, the drawers were awful.  I had read many cautionary reviews and was prepared to make sure that the drawer was seated perfectly before pushing it in all the way - and it still stuck.  And would not come out.  Others had said that we just needed to loosen the joints and we could get it out.  Nope.  We had to completely take the table apart, and then build it back around the drawers.  All in all, it took my sister and I several hours to complete this table.  But, again, once completed, it's a nice table.

Easy to assemble, the USB charging mount is quite useful as well. I‚Äôd imagine this feature is on its way to become standard on tables like this

Good solid product. Exactly as desand expected. Would buy again

We ordered a table just like this one about 6 months ago. So when I ordered this one i didn‚Äôt even think twice.  When we got it and my husband was assembling  it he said it was much more difficult  and when he finished it it was about 4 inches shorter then the first one we got. It still looks good but it is smaller which is a bummer.

Sturdy, good appearance, handy, BUT, always a BUT, only gave 4 stars as very time consuming to put together.  Ad says 20 minutes, NOT! 1st, there are over 20+ pieces and MANY MANY screws.  My spouse is very good, as in fast and good, took about an hour to assemble.  Putting it together was not difficult, as instructions are quite good and all pieces numbered, but no way, can this be put together in 20 minutes.  I detest misleading ads, and this company dropped the ball on that part.

I purchased one to use between two recliners as a charging station/remote holder. The build took less than an hour and the only tool you‚Äôll need (that doesn‚Äôt come with the kit) is a medium Phillips screwdriver. The first one I purchased had a damaged drawer system that sent little ball bearings shooting across my living room. I contacted the company via the email address in the instruction booklet and it was responded to within 8 hours. A few email back-and-forths resulted in the company sending me a brand new table!  Within a couple of days, my new table was delivered, built, and in use. Again, I am not a fan of the actual drawer system, but the rest of the table is sturdy. Certainly worth the $90 I put into it. I consider it quality purchase for what I need. I can‚Äôt say it enough, the customer service was incredible!

It went together pretty easily but they sent me the wrong instructions. They sent me instructions for a shoe rack. I emailed them and they did send me instructions the following day but I had already put it together watching video on YouTube.

my biggest gripe is that the drawers only go about half way. But this works for what I need, and what I needed was a small, cheap end table that i could stick in a corner of dead space.

Nice product. Sturdy, perfect size

Assembly instructions were very good. Liked the hardware packaging identifying specific screws.The color is a little darker than expected, reason for only 4 *.

...a little smaller than I anticipated, but all the pieces were there, it assembled fairly easily in about an hour and the only tool I needed that was not supplied was a medium Philips head screwdriver. For $80.00 it does what I needed it to do.

I needed something to fit in a specific spot; not to small & not too big. This nightstand does the job well!  I do wish there was a little more room in the drawers & more height on the second level.  But at least all of the outlets all came working and ready to go! I‚Äôve had bad experiences with furniture that come with USB ports, so I was surprised these came in working perfectly.

It‚Äôs a little smaller than I wanted but works perfectly. I have a lamp and my controllers with a tissue box on top and small notebooks in the drawer. Wished I ordered 2

Easy to put together even though you need a electric screw gun made it easy

Easy to assemble. Like design.

This table was surprisingly easy to assemble. Often these pre-fab units are frustrating to get together, especially for one person. But this went together with zero problems and the instructions were simple enough for a toddler to follow.While the table is narrow the drawers are very long so you'll need room in front of it if you want to use the drawers. The finish looks pretty good and the whole thing looks clean and well designed. I ordered one to see if I like it but I'll probably get a matching one for the other side. Thumbs up.

Really like the finalized product based on the cost. One of pieces was cracked on arrival.  I tried to glue it, but it broke while assembling. I contacted Rolanstar directly and Leah was amazing. She responded within 10 minutes and quickly figured out a solution within an hour! I was sent a whole new end table a few days later and it came out great. It takes some effort to put together, but doable for one person. Considering the price, the table is solid, I definitely would consider buying Rolanstar in the future due to my positive experience with this product.

Parts of it are very flimsy and thin, but so far it is sturdy and fits in my small space really well.  The drawers move easily but don't think they can hold much weight as the bottom is super thin.

The table fits the space I needed to. Sturdy enough but the drawers don‚Äôt fit properly, only one will shut at a time but never together.

I love the wood look and the sturdiness of the table.  You have to be very careful when installing the draws.  One of the draw rails got bent when I was installing it.  Several of the ball bearings escaped from the track and I had to go to Home Depot to replace the track.

I was able to put this together by myself. I like the finished product

My wife and I enjoyed assembling this product.

Thin laminated particle board construction. It is only 12" wide could be 4-6" wider. Good for a small narrow space. I glued all the joints during construction. (Recommended)  Okay for the price range.

I really like it just the right size

We love our table. Only downfall was it came missing the pack panel piece. I still put it together as I was halfway through and didn‚Äôt want to deal with having to package and send it back. Luckily it‚Äôs in the back so it‚Äôs not noticeable.

Packaged well, easy to put together. Quality actually seems a bit better the then cheap laminate end tables ya find at most places.  Would recommend.

Piece as advertised. Mine either came with a set of wrong screws or the wrong/missing tool. I had to fine a different Allen wrench than what came with it (smaller than usual). Fortunately, I had one from an actual tool set I bought years ago.

Very sturdy construction and the wood feels solid. Plug and cord are good qualify and I am not concerned plugging small things into it. The only issue I had with it was the screws and handles were SUPER easy to strip when installing, which resulted in me going to Home Depot to pick up new handles. Just be careful when you are installing parts to not over tighten as the screws are easy to strip.

I ordered two tables and they had different parts. One table I put together had plastic parts and the other table had rubber parts for the drawers. The tables look good fits perfectly in my small apartment and are sturdy.

I am always cautious about ordering furniture you need to assemble, even though I love putting stuff together, as there are always quality control problems. I can honestly say that there were none on this one!1. It came very well packed, so there were no dings or scratches on the parts.2. Nothing was missing. In fact, there was a bag of extra parts in case I dropped anything behind my sofa while assembling!3. All parts were clearly labeled with stickers that were easy to remove, but that were stuck firmly enough to not come "unstuck" in shipping.4. The assembly diagram was very clear and helpful. Whoever wrote it actually understood how it went together! The steps were logically sequenced and clearly illustrated.5. All tools needed were included. I chose to use my own Phillips-head screwdriver for some steps, but there was one included if you needed it.5. Everything fit and lined up perfectly. I have put together a LOT of furniture in the last few decades, and that is unheard of.6. The final product is solid and stable, and does not wobble at all without any need for me to tamper with it to stabilize it or even anything up. That means all the pieces were carefully measured, and all the screw holes were in the right places.Overall, I'd say this was well-engineered and carefully manufactured. It is attractive an as a narrow-fit table fits well in the space we needed it for and works as advertised. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!

I love this table. It was very easy to assemble, although it did take some time, as there are a lot of parts. Everything was very well labeled so that made it easy to put together. The drawers slide well and are quite roomy. The top is great for plugging in the ipad, and phone, with room for 2 more. There are adjusters on the legs for leveling. It looks great and seems to be very sturdy. I highly recommend this.

I really wasn't expecting much from this little $59 table but was pleasantly surprised!  The wood is nice, solid and pretty.  It's sturdy and the drawers roll very smoothly.  It went together without a hitch - all the parts were there and everything fit.  It's exactly what I needed for the small spot I had beside the couch and I'm absolutely loving it!

I bought two of these, and they were exactly what I needed for my office. I didn't have much space on either side of my desk, so these proved to be a perfect fit, offering me adequate storage space for my needs. Do your research and make sure it's the right size before you buy, because they are definitely small (which was perfect for me).The build quality is slightly above what you'd expect for this price range, but still fairly cheaply made. Despite that, the included hardware does a great job keeping everything tight and stable, which is rare for items like this. After several weeks of regular use they're still rock solid. I wouldn't recommend putting them in high-traffic areas, however, since they scratch easily.I only had one outlet by my desk, so adding these powered end tables gave me all the charging options I needed. USB-C would have been nice, though.The leveling feet are a nice touch, since I ended up having to place two of the four feet on a rug. I was able to easily level it out by unscrewing the other two legs a bit.The biggest strength, IMO, is the ease of use. This company clearly put a lot of thought into the assembly process and instructions, so building it was a breeze (even the drawers). Probably the best self-assembly experience I've had for products like this.If you're on a tight budget and need a simple, nice-looking solution for storage, power, and surface space, I'd highly recommend this product.

I was looking for slim end tables for my living room that would also help control clutter. This table is a great size. The drawers have plenty of space, and the shelf is an added bonus. I was very pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to assemble the tables. The drawer tracks are already attached, which made that step much simpler than I have experienced with other furniture assembly. The tables are also a little heavier than I expected which I hope means they are good enough quality the last for a while.

This small table is perfect beside my recliner. I keep my laptop on it , it has an electric outlet and place to charge my phone. Has two drawers to keep my junk in and it looks great. It was easy to assemble ,came with its own tools . You will need a screwdriver though and the directions are very good. Well built and a really nice price.

Product is amazing, very sturdy and well built, easy to put together. It also came 3 days early which was nice. Got it all set up and it holds everything I needed it to and fit my couch perfectly. No USBc port but other than that power supply is great and has a long cord about 3/4 the length of my couch.Overall 5/5 stars

The actual product looks darker and smoother than the picture on the ad. It‚Äôs professionally crafted. To my happy surprise, it fits very well with the desk I purchased. At first look, you might think they came together.

We purchased 2 of these for our boys' rooms.  Assembly was easy - there were no mismatched panels, etc.  There was even extra hardware.  The quality is good and after assembly, they were solid and not 'wobbly' like some others I've purchased.  Definitely would purchase again.

There were lots of parts to this piece of furniture. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Came together well and worked exactly as it should. Drawers slide easy and it's the perfect size for the space I was working with.

We purchased 2 glad we did.  Love the thin slim design and brown black color.  Fits perfectly on the side of our reclining sofa and loveseat.  Easy to assemble and very sturdy.  The drawers slide nicely.  Very happy with our purchase.

I like the storage drawers that the table has. I also like the charging station. The table is sturdy and worth the money. The directions for assembly were clear and easy to follow.

I am always leary of items,  such as furniture, that require assembly. Too often, holes don't align or other issues that require additional drilling/machining to make parts fit properly. These tables are well engineered. All the parts and hardware were included and everything assembled perfectly. In addition, I suspect that they will be very long lasting too.

Bought 2 of these end tables to replace some really old ones. Perfect in every way. Only draw back was having to put every little piece together, but I would still recommend.

Packaged and protected very well! Everything was labeled clearly. Instructions were easy to follow. Installed in less than an hour. Only negative is my preference for more of a wall flushed plug‚Ä¶ I had to pull my couch out from the wall a couple more inches, but that‚Äôs not enough to dock any stars from the rating. I love the 2 drawers for storage. Holes lined up perfectly for screws. Perfect side table.

I purchased a new sofa and didn't like the way the old end tables looked with the new sofa. So, I ordered this new end table based solely on the pictures. It looks great with the new sofa!!  It was fairly easy to assemble even with just pictures. Took about 30 minutes.  It's sturdy and has 2 storage drawers as an added bonus.  Highly recommend it.

My husbands table

Very functional and sturdy. Easy to assemble. It looks like solid wood. Very happy with my purchase.

Great table that is made of actual wood and not cardboard.  The hardest part was the door to the drawers.  It only took me an hour to put together.

Perfect instructions nothing skipped over or unclear, that being said it will still take longer than 20 minutes to put together. more like 45, the first end table then maybe 29 minutes the second.

Awesome little side tables. Easy to put together. Perfect for what I needed.

This side table is sturdy, good quality. It was easy to put together. It has handy outlets/USBs and 2 little drawers in the front and a shelf.

I expected a metal table with a wood look wrap. Even a veneer type grain glued on some low quality material. This looks and feel great. It's solid, and the pads at the base of of legs adjust so it will not rock. Believe it or not, I use mine as a computer stand. It sits next to my wood desk with my mid-tower computer on top. The two drawers are perfect for the computers accessories. and two external Hard drives sits on the shelf under the computer. My hard drives are only 7" high as this shelf is about 9 1/2 inches high. I added two sided gorilla tape to the bottom of the HD, just in case the table is bumped. Yes this "engineered wood" stand blended perfect with my wood furniture in my room.

These tables are so easy to assemble and they look great!  Having outlets and USB ports are so convenient.  We love it!

This table was easy to assemble and is sturdy.  Fits exactly were I needed it to fit.  Love my little end table

This is a nice looking piece of inexpensive furniture.  The drawers hold a lot more than I anticipated.  I also love the USB ports as well as the plugs on the top back of the table.  I'm in my 70s and though it wasn't FUN, I had no issues putting it together on my own.  It only took 6 weeks .... ok it seemed like 6 weeks. It was probably more like 1-2 hrs.

Holds all I need to be comfortable!  Ivan charge my phone using a short cord plugged in right by my side!

I absolutely love this small end table. If you're looking for something to fit within a small space with minimal wiggle room, I would highly suggest getting one of these! I use it as a nightstand. I originally purchased this in October of 2022 and I have not had a single issue with it. All plug outlets and USB ports have worked without any issues since the day I built it. The drawers glide open with no issues and are deep enough to hold plenty of items.I recently decided to purchase another one of these to place on the other side of my bed to have a matching pair and this 2nd one came in just as nice. No parts or hardware were missing from either purchase, no damages found on any of the pieces. the wood material is also very strong and feels real even though I'm pretty sure that its technically made with that press board type stuff that everything seems to be made of nowadays.Overall, I would likely order these again if I ever needed to replace them.

Very easy to assemble. Fits nicely with my furniture.

It was easy to put together

I normally don‚Äôt need instructions but if you do the instructions are great. They are very easy to follow. All the items are labeled and in separate bags. The table parts are also well constructed.

The table is very sturdy and goes together great!

Fits nicely between two recliners.

Takes about two hrs to assemble. But it's useful and reliable and I like the multi-plug outlets

Excellent

VERY SOLID and easy to combine.Literally beyond my expectation.

I have a small room that I use for an office. I needed a small charging table and this fits perfectly. The shelf and 2 drawers sold me! If your short on space, I'd recommend giving this table a look.

Came across this table and absolutely agree with the other 5 star reviews.  In my case, I was looking to clear the top of desk of computer peripherals (i.e. VR goggles and accessories, various chargers, GoPro cameras, GPS, communication devices, etc) I don't use on a daily basis.  This end table does just that.  In addition to accommodating peripherals I moved my desktop computer case from my desk top.  Couldn't be more pleased with the packaging and quality of this product.

Good small stand to help u put everything comfortably next to u.

My husband and I both were impressed. The finish is great, we love the extra storage, and the usb and plug in on top, gives it extra versatility. The size was perfect.

This table is just what I needed. Perfect size and well built with lots of storage! Great value!

The product was very good and very easy to put together.

It's placed next to my bed I have a lamp, my phone charger, and my Alexa charging on the table plugs associated with the stand it's very convenient. Plus the drawer are a plus to store bed as use odds and ends.. now they selling it for 20.00 less than when I paid for it.. oh well it's worth every bit.

It was easy to put together and looks great.

Easy assembly great value for $

Sturdy and nice looking. The only thing I wish was different is the drawers. They don‚Äôt go all the way back should‚Äôve made them longer.

Love, love this table. Bought one and a week bought another.

I can keep remotes, kindle and phone charged easily. I have room for tissues, books, and tv guide handy without having them all piled on top of an endtable. I can keep a notepad and pen handy if I need to write down a phone number or email address from an advertisment on the tv.

Bought this for a narrow bedroom to go between the gap between the wall and the bed. It‚Äôs perfect for a small nightstand and has some storage space as well, two small drawers, a shelf and a table top.It comes packaged well, with an obscene amount of foam. All necessary tools are included, along with some spares.There are quite a bit of pieces and it took about an hour for me moving at a decent pace, but it takes a but of time to get some parts stable if you do it by yourself. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the screws lining up, just keeping things stable enough to get them aligned.Once finished, it‚Äôs nice and sturdy, and the wood it used may get scratched over time, but I‚Äôve had similar furniture hold up over two decades and still going. For the price, I‚Äôm really happy with it.

We didn't even get this table assembled before we decided it was junk. The threaded inserts in the wood top immediately came out in 2 places preventing the top from being properly attached. Also, the table top is 2 separate pieces, so there is a seam down the middle. That wouldn't be a problem if it properly lined up, but once the brackets were attached there was a lopsided gap in the seam. That is where we stopped and shoved it all back in the box. You get what you pay for!

Couldn't be assembled, the holes on the underside of the wood were misaligned and caused not only a huge gap between pieces of wood, but I couldn't finish assembly

I was very disappointed with the purchase I thought this was going to be a ‚Äúbar height‚Äù table and it ended up being a regular living room table size and not what I was looking for

Stability issues, the table rocks back and forth like crazy on a flat hard wood floor. Not very good....

I have this table and really like it. I‚Äôm trying to order a second one, but they have sent the wrong size twice. Very frustrating.

I could have bought a cheaper console if I knew the outlet was not going to work. I didn‚Äôt check it until I finished putting the whole thing together or I would have returned it. So disappointed.

Holes missing on piece. Do not buy this.

I had to figure out how to put this thing together myself and it was missing all types of screws in the screw in the back doesn‚Äôt even fit flush. It‚Äôs a pretty table and I like it but it‚Äôs not complete

I think I would like this table but when I went to unscrew the power strip, the screws were so cheap they completely stripped even though I was being incredibly careful. I ended up damaging the table top trying to get the power strip out. Very disappointed.

Nowhere near as sturdy as it should be. Sags significantly under the weight of my tv (which I bought it for). Waste of money.

plugs on top don‚Äôt work! Table is already assembled and box thrown away so I don‚Äôt think I can return.

The screws were too long for the table. They went right through the top. Returned immediately. Such a bummer!! Really wanted this to work for us.

Missing insert piece for foot of table because of this it‚Äôs wobbly and was difficult to assemble.

Small table nothing what description states

First of all, I would give zero star !  BecauseNote : I am handicapped and don‚Äôt have use one of arm.So I received this console table on August 12, on the 24 a professional came to my house to fix the table.  Unfortunately when he open the box, he told me that I was missing ALL the parts to fix the table, also no instructions booklet. So I paid him for the visit and he left me with my parts, but no table.First, I asked Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to come to my home to pick up the return. I called many times, telling them that for me it is impossible to take it to Purolator because I am handicapped.  Amazon doesn‚Äôt care.Now I am in contact with Rolandstar since the 26 of August, and I am writing to an AI, not a person.So I receive the same email again and again. I requested to speak to a representative, a human, so far no person has call me or answer my email.I am very confused and very disappointed with the Rolandstar company.  Very bad service and also at Amazon for not offering me to pick up the package. I am now asking for a refund, same problem they say no.Don‚Äôt buy from this company service is awful and done by AI, who doesn‚Äôt understand problem solving.Again don‚Äôt loose your money on this company, they don‚Äôt have a support service to help solve the problem.Again very disappointed and getting angry üò°Nobody wants to help

Do not buy this unless you are willing to painstakingly peel off tons of little stickers off the top of the surface.Adhesive residue remains... I'll try to clean it but I'm almost inclined to send it back.  What terrible quality control is this...

The table top does not line up. The two parts do not meet in the middle -leaving a gap. Furthermore, if you place the metal supports in the holes provided, the long sides of the tabletop are not flush either. Very disappointed

As I was setting up this table the screws came off :(

Purchased 2 of these in the past and both were beautiful.  This one came in and the table is in 2 pieces so it leaves a gap in the middle once assembled, looks cheap the wood doesn't line up - not a product shipped from seller as indicated, shipping label from China .... not happy

No assembly tools

Some of the screws are misaligned with the holes and the table top comes in two pieces so there is space between them; no matter how hard you try to push them close together, the space is still noticeable.! I am using this table for behind my bed, so the space on the table top will not be noticed by others, and since it was so difficult to put together, I will kept it and not return it. But if you are using this table where people will see it, there is a space between the two pieces of table top and it will show.

The top piece was in two parts and looked kind of cheap. The frame structure was easy to put together and felt sturdy. May replace the top piece with a higher quality piece of wood or refinish it myself.

I had a lot of difficulty putting this together because the holes don't line up. There are several screws I wasn't able to screw in and I actually didn't even complete putting it together because of this. Two weeks prior I put together a desk 3x the size of this table, with similar construction and instructions. I had no problems there, so I know this isn't a "me" problem - this table is just poorly made. With that said, it fits the space I intended on placing it, and I do like the wood-look finish. I just have to be careful that it doesn't fall apart :/

The outlets were convenient.  However, I have to keep replugging at least the USB outlets to get it working.

Upon sight this is little more than a wood grain sticker over particle board.  Looks and feels cheap.  We will see if it holds up.  Perhaps the base can be used to support an actual table top as time goes on.

The media could not be loaded.
                



It didn‚Äôt take too long but did take some concentration, I got it all set up and ready and I love it but the power box doesn‚Äôt work at all. I wish that I could‚Äôve saved some money on one that was cheaper and without the power box instead. Pretty disappointed.

The entry table is nice looking, but top heavy which, because it is a little too narrow, tends to easy be tipped.

It is functional flatpack furniture.Two things that make it less-desirable:1) The table top is two pieces and no matter how carefully you align everything during the build, it's way more obvious than the picture here shows. I'll probably replace it with a top that I build myself.2) The legs are designed to be interchangeable (probably to cut down on manufacturing cost and simplify the build). But, this results in open bolt holes for the strut on the front of each pair of legs legs. A couple of black plastic plugs worth $0.0001 would have gone a long way toward giving this a cleaner look.If you want functional "okay" looking furniture, this is an option. If you want decent looking furniture, pass this one up.

Love the look of this product, it is perfect between our couch and the wall. So very disappointing that the USB ports died after 3 weeks! That was a selling point for us. Don‚Äôt recommend you but it if you want a USB port

The table is beautifully designed, fits very well in my space, it's also made of good material and is sturdy.It would be perfect if the cable for the desktop charger can be hidden into the frame, so that it won't be shown hanging under the table.The reason for giving 3 stars only: The table top came chipped on one side.  Since it is assembled, we really don't want to take it apart again. We will contact the vendor and hope that they can send us a replacement table top.

Definitely not grey. It works for the space behind the couch but disappointed with the colour.

The ‚Äúwood like‚Äù finish of the table top looks very cheapPictures do not do it justice, very misleading

Used it for our long hallway in the upper floor the cord was too short to have the table centered. The cord is also thick so its not the most aesthetically pleasing for the hallway.

Liked table sent gray ordered brown reordered hopefully with get brown will send others back

Top edge of top was falling off, had to be glued

Great, useful solution for narrow hallways.  I ordered 2, and I have assembled a lot of furniture in my day;  this one came with good instructions, labeled and marked clearly, however, it was a time consuming event!  Oh so many bolts, to hand screw in loosely first, then when complete, crank down on all of them.  The second one went much faster.  It's perfect for what I needed and looks modern and sleek.  Thank you.

I was putting it together and added the center screw for the legs. I let go to get the corner screws and the leg fell over taking the screw and hole out.  With the 4 corner screws in tight I‚Äôm sure it is fine and good to go.  Just don‚Äôt let go of the legs when assembling.For the second legs I put the corners in first. It‚Äôs a perfect fit for the space I have it in.

Looks nice and well made. Didn‚Äôt notice when buying top was two pieces, but still looks nice.

It‚Äôs great for a enterance way as you see here, unfortunately it could become a catch all when you walk in the door. I love mine!

Nice table easy to put together

Looks good, works well

Only got for of these should be nine I believe.

this fits where i wanted it and it is just right width and length

Definitely make sure to scroll through pictures of this item after it's bought, cause the gray was significantly darker than I thought, and and there was a very prominent wood pattern that didn't match my room.

I bought this to put behind our couch.  It‚Äôs the perfect size and height.  My only complaint is that the two pieces that create the top do not line up perfectly.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs user error or just how it‚Äôs made.  We have a lamp there that covers it, but if that would be an issue for you, take note.

A little hard to assemble for one person. screws hard to install. screws don't seem to fit the predrilled holes. also top is 2 pieces that don't fit snugly (A tiny crack is left.) But overall pleased with the purchase.

This is a good table for my purposes, which is to hold books.  The instructions are practically mistake proof which I love because I am nervous when assembling things.  The parts and screws are all labeled alphabetically and the instruction manual has pictures which made assembly easy. Other manufacturers should take note.  Weight limit is listed as 50 pounds which led me to this table as I knew I would be keeping some heavy books on it.  I‚Äôve only had it a few days, but so far I am pleased with this table.

I was looking for something strong enough to support my TV, while having a large enough space underneath to put a 75 gallon tank (while being able to reach in and out of the tank for maintenance). The table holds my TV and play station perfectly, there is no room for anything else on the table top but we made it work. The outlets on the table made it easy to hide cords and keep it looking nice.

Christmas gift for my husband. Slim fit is perfect, doesn't take up much space. Added lamps to brighten my husband's office. Good purchase for his needs.

I needed a deeper desk because I can't see my monitor clearly anymore & my current desk isn't deep enough to push the monitor away from me, so I got this to nest with my desk when not in use, and to pull my desk forward towards me when I need to work on my computer. This affordable console is my solution to using what I already have & improving my vision situation without the need to replace my entire desk set up..The table is very easy to assemble and with my 28lb monitor on it, against the wall, it is very stable. If black and grays are your choice of tones, it is very nice, unfortunately, on that note, I REALLY wanted white & sadly surprised it wasn't available. That said, I still highly recommend this item.

I wasn't much of a fan of the color of the tables, but they worked out great for my intended purpose behind my coach. They've held up great and glad I got them for a resonable price.

Great little table it was easy to put together. I like the faux wood looking stuff on the top and that it comes with a little outlet that‚Äôs very handy. I put my TV on top of it my previous TV was a little too heavy for it  so I could see it bow just a little bit but I bought a newer TV and it holds it all perfectly I like that the back of it is open with a support bar. I originally bought it because I was putting it in front of a cold air return. I think it looks great my dining table fits under it perfectly with some chairs. I put some shelves along the side of it I like the final look.

This was easy to put together with great directions. I love the charger on it!

Overall, this table is pretty good. I like that it fits behind the couch nicely and has an outlet built into it, however, it‚Äôs not as sturdy as I had hoped. It moves, slides or tips over easier than it should.

I like this table a lot. I have it placed against a wall near an outlet as it also has an outlet on the table surface which is handy for my little lamp and charging my phone.  I gave 4 stars as it is a light table and doesn't seem super sturdy, although it does come with straps to anchor to the wall for those who might have children or pets. I was able to follow included directions to assemble it with no problems.  Mine arrived in good condition. Happy with my purchase.

It's a really nice table. Love that it has outlets on the table top for added plugging in of electronics. It wasn't super difficult to put togeher however, two of the brackets that go on the lower part of the legs seemed to be slightly longer then it should of been. I was able to shimmy the pieces into place but as shown in my image, caused some visual damage to the metal.

A nice table. I like the two USB ports so you can charge a couple devices. I would have given it 5 stars, but some of the parts were not built to spec and had to be bent to fit the wooden top. All in all though, a good table with charging ports.

It was an easy put together and looks like pictureNice table for plants

I like the way it looks I will use it for a tv stand in my guest beadroom

Table was perfect for a 55‚Äù TV stand. Very pleased

It came dented. Other than that easy to put together and looks great!

Looks good, sturdy.  A little taller than I expected but that‚Äôs on me

Great value for the price. It's sturdy and assembled with in 45 minutes

I am extremely satisfied with this order. Easy to assemble, good quality. Highly recommended.

Legs could have been a little sterdier. But otherwise good product.

It does exactly what I needed it for. But I wish it was longer.

Good value.

I got this so I can charge my phone on the sofa while watching TV. It fits very well going beside my sofa and it‚Äôs very useful with all the different outlets. It was very easy to assemble with the instructions provided, quality is pretty good too!I gave 4 star instead of 5 because the type C charging port was not working well when I first got it, I would have to hold the plug in order for it to charge and it would stop if I let go. HOWEVER, the seller was AMAZING when I approached them with the problem and they sent me a new one very quickly to replace, now it works amazingly! It‚Äôs been a couple of months now and I haven‚Äôt encountered any new problems yet, let‚Äôs hope it stays this way!

This Console table as easy to assemble and pretty straight forward;  Toke my toddler & I under 1 hour to put together.  Look greats for the price point, just be careful to not scratch the top, as it is easy to scuff when assembling. Power outlet is pretty handy too!Would i buy this piece again? Definitely.

Nice and easy to assemble console table. Does the job.

So though it looks nice, the electrical outlet stopped working one by one. First the usb outlets stopped working about 4 months after purchase and now the plugs stopped working about 18 months after purchase. Disappointed.

Nice Console table for the price. Not the best build quality, and takes a bit to put together but when you factor in the cost and that it comes from Amazon (free delivery) it's a decent buy. Ikea would have something maybe better build quality, but without the free/quick shipping

This side table worked perfectly for what we needed. It was easy to assemble, it‚Äôs sturdy too.

Instructions were perfectly clear, both the written AND the graphics.

This is a great looking table, also incredibly sturdy. I only gave it 4 stars out of 5 since the usb/electrical outlet built in does not work super fast. It may just be my cord in which case I'll be back to change my rating to 5 stars.

little wobble but overall good fog the money

Nice table looks great behind the couch and is the perfect height! Pretty easy to assemble. Just follow the directions paying close attention to the pictures and you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems. No missing parts even sent a spare parts bag with extra screws. Didn‚Äôt realize at first that it had a wood grain look as I ordered it from my phone but I like it.

Very happy with my purchase. Table is very nice and the price is great. If you order the long one just be aware the top comes in two pieces that have to be joined together. I am not using the power supply but it‚Äôs very heavy duty and good quality.

I recommend this entryway table. I would have given it a 5 out of 5 but there are some rust spots on the two horizontal bars which hold up the wood tabletop. This appears to be a quality control issue.Pros:1. Sturdy2. Well designed - Nice feature with outlet on top. Both outlets and USB's work.3. Looks great4. Easy assembly5. Great priceCons:1. Rust on the horizontal bars

Nice for smaller spaces. The two pieces of wood that make up the top didn't quite line up properly but that's mostly an esthetic problem.  Love the charging ports!

Used this behind the sofa with a few stools for instant additional seating for watching the big games. Very sturdy and great functionality for its price.

Does the job, smaller than I thought. Seems sturdy, I‚Äôm using it for a tv stand. Does have metal legs which is a plus. I would recommend it.

Sturdier than expected and went together easy!

Easy to assemble, looks great and is actually sturdy.

Very versatile. Can be used as a desk and the outlets on top make connecting electronics a breeze.

Easy assembly instructions, and looks great once completed. Great for a narrow spot in a small room or behind a couch. Having the outlets is a nice perk

Happy with my order, great additionIt is nice size and height

The table came in a very compact box. It was packed carefully and all the parts were protected by plastic sleeves, pieces of foam and plastic protectors on every corner of the wooden top. I thought the top would be a single piece but it‚Äôs actually two halves. But it looks very nice regardless. Once built this table seems very sturdy.The assembly is easy, with properly labeled and numbered parts. Everything lines up and fits perfectly. There are three different sized hex screws used. Although an Allen wrench is included, I would recommend using a battery drill or screwdriver instead, as I did, to make the process a lot faster. There are a few spare screws included, which is thoughtful if the manufacturer. It even comes with a couple of straps to attach the table to a wall to prevent it from tipping over. I put the table behind a sofa, so I did not use the straps.I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase and would recommend the table.

Easy to assemble, Great quality, and Great value

This product is very nice. It was not only easy to put together but it is also very elegant. I measured it out and it fit under my tv and it fit my Labradors dog bed under it with the toy bin.

This was one of the best purchases I have made my kiddos love it and now I have my kitchen bar back it is wonderful fir the laptops and it comes in different sizes to fit your needs you cannot go wrong with this one it's well made and the plug in on top with USB is a big plus and could be used for many different things as well love it very much thank you Amazon

I would recommend to everyone!  You can use it for children to sit to do their homework or to have a quick snack.  Easily wipes clean  and doesn‚Äôt take up too much space and just love the overall look. I actually bought 2 for different areas.

We wanted to extend seating between our dining area and living room. This positions perfectly behind our couch so that family can still be part of the discussion, see tv, or sit close to us at the table. It does sit a little high for normal dining room chairs, so kids will have trouble reaching their plate!  Looks really nice, matches our other furniture and the crisscross matches our new lighting. We zip-tied the power cord along the backside since our outlet is on the opposite side of the room and used an existing power bar to plug into. Wish there was an option for the outlet to be on the other end.

This was the perfect table. I bought it specifically for my mother to place it under the TV. She loves it. It offers good amount of space to place her family pics, control, charge her phone and connect items such as radio, diffuser, and even charge her electtronics(phone/tablet)

I like how quick and easy this was to assemble. It took all of 15 minutes. I use it to hold my plants. I have some pretty heavy pots, and this table is very sturdy.

My 55‚Äù TV fits perfect on this narrow table.

I purchased this table for my office. With the plugs I don‚Äôt need to find surge protectors. I was able to mount a board on the bottom for additional storage and printers on top. Works perfectly!

It's a great table.  I love it.  But thank goodness my husband has his own tools and had the patience to put it together.  Yes, it came with a couple of flimsy tools, but they didn't do the job.  So be prepared to spend some time putting it together, but beyond that, it perfectly does what I wanted, which is give my houseplants a place to live underneath a window.  And the added charging ports are a bonus.

We purchased this for our camper which doesn‚Äôt have a built in entertainment center. It is very useful with the built in outlets and comes in handy. Installation was easy and it is extremely lightweight.

Perfect size and it was a breeze to assemble. Seems very sturdy so far. Happy with the purchase overall.

Very nice, well made. Love this sofa table!.

I have a tiny bedroom in a very old restored home. So there isn‚Äôt a lot of space to have unnecessary furniture sitting around. Bought this table and it‚Äôs PERFECT !!!! Drink, phone charger, pistol‚Ä¶. Anything that you take to bed with you . I used 5 inch bed risers and made the bed match the height of the table. Oh yeah‚Ä¶.. EASY ASSEMBLY!

I picked this slim table to sit behind our electric picnic. It was just the right size and gives a little space to set music books and a lamp. It was fairly easy to put together, just be sure to read and follow the instructions carefully, especially the part about not tightening screws until the end.

Very nice. The directions were easy to follow-it took me less than an hour to put it together. Would definitely buy it again!

My wife needed this so our houseplants could be placed near a window and it worked like a charm. It was easy to assemble, is surprisingly sturdy, and looks great. And the plants love their new home.

Everything was included in the box. Even  had spare parts and required toolfor assembly. This product we used for a behind the sofa console table.

I use it as a tv stand over a 48 inches radiator in my dining area

I'm as guilty as the next person when it comes to leaving negative feedback when we're unhappy but not positive feedback when we're pleased.  Here is my attempt to reverse that unfortunate trend.  this table came well packaged, with just enough packing material to keep it safe, but not too much to create waste.  There were no missing parts.  Every part was labelled, and as a bonus the label stickers were easy to remove without leaving adhesive residue.  The powder coating was thick and robust.  The imitation wood had a color, grain pattern and sheen to look very natural and not fake.  The table top finish was scuff/scratch resistant.  All the screw holes aligned properly and assembly was quick and easy.  The table looks great and is super sturdy.  Couldn't be more pleased.

Very happy with this table.  Charges my items and looks okay by my front door entry.  A little shaky but we only use it for hats and charging.

Great instructions and straightforward assembly

I am beyond pleased with my new table.  Its a quality product.  Just follow the assembly instructions and everything comes together as it should.  I am very happy!

Nice and sturdy, and easy to assemble. Definitely recommend

Have been waiting to purchase this piece of furniture for several months. So glad I did, it was perfect to be behind my sofa.

Perfect for the space behind my sectional‚Äîroom for decor, phone charger (has two USB ports), and  can plug in lamps. Best part: it doesn‚Äôt eat up valuable space. I have room under this console-sofa table for two round ottomans/tufts for extra seating. Love it!

This console table was easy to assemble. It was the right size and height for placing some potted plants under a bedroom window. Would buy this again.

I have to admit I had low expectations ordering this sight unseen, for a relatively low cost, but was pretty impressed when I assembled it. Yes, it's made in China and it's not hi-end designer furniture, but you already knew that by ordering it from Amazon, for well under 100 dollars. It's relatively sturdy. I wouldn't sit on it, but I'd feel OK putting 5-10 pounds worth of "stuff" on it without fear of it collapsing or tipping over.  It looks nice, even up close. No visible scratches, dings, flaws, etc.  The metal parts have 'textured coating', giving it a matte finish. Very easy to assemble. All the pieces, holes, etc. lined up perfectly, which in itself was impressive. I've seen similar imported tables in "real" furniture stores (similar materials and quality) selling for around 200 dollars (or more), so price-wise, this was a no-brainer purchase.If you trust USPS (or whoever) to deliver it undamaged (that is a huge factor here), I would strongly recommend getting one.

Simple good looking, easy to assemble table with outlets. Functional in my foyer and woodgrain looks great. The device charging ports are a nice touch as well adding some convenience to the table. Added some zip ties to keep the outlet cord a little more hidden and cleaner installation. Went with the wider 11" deep tip for a little more table area but may have been able to get away with the 7". Definitely recommend üëå

Very easy to assemble! Love the industrial look. I really love that it comes with its own 2.plug in and3 USB ports. 5 star very sturdy!

I really liked this table, it was very easy to put together. It‚Äôs also sturdy. I liked it so much I got another one.

It serves what I want it to be in our front room entrance.  A little tedious to assemble and the screws are smaller but in totality, it is a very piece of furniture.

Good table and very sturdy.

Using it for a behind a couch tv stand.  The table takes a bit to assemble but it is not hard to do.  It‚Äôs helpful to have someone lending a hand during assembly.  We are very happy with this purchase.

Sturdy and actually looks good like the photo. Easy to put together and holds 3 plants with decent weight just fine. And the side plug ins are handy when anyone needs an outlet and somewhere out of the way to put their phone to charge.

This table was easy to assemble, it's sturdy & looks great.

Easy to assemble! Right space to put the laptops when not in use. Just what I needed. Very easy to assemble! Do not screwed too tight ! Put the pieces together and then tighten the screws.

Easy to assemble. Convenient outlet on top of table for electric and mobile phones/ iPads.

To each his own, but I wanted a one-piece top that was the advertised length of the table, not two or more cut pieces that had to be tiled end to end to achieve the advertised length.  After having ordered (and returned) other sets elsewhere that required tiling, but for which the product descriptions failed to state as such being required, this seller was the only one to respond to my product enquiry asking what was the length of the shipping box. Once I was informed the box length, I knew I had a one-piece table top that the wood was the length as advertised. Others may not mind cut boards that must be tiled end-to-end to reach to have a top of the length as advertised, but asthetically, it matters to me.

This is great and exactly what I needed for a seating bar behind my couch. Easy assembly and sturdy. Good height as it fit my 3 bar chairs. The cord was not long enough to plug into an outlet on a left-facing wall, which can be fixed with an extension cord.

I was looking for an entry table this exact size to fit a particularly odd space. It's like it was custom built and I got the extra perk of an outlet which later came in handy. Easy assembly and great price.

Got this for my mom‚Äòs new place, and she absolutely loves it. The plug-in works amazing. Although I Do  wish it was a little more sturdy, but what it is used for it‚Äôs great

We have a very long and narrow living area. The placement of our doors and windows further complicates things. Decided to try this table (the short version) and am pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it is for the price! Love the charging station. Assembly was so easy I did it in my lap sitting down ha. I usually leave my handy fianc√© in charge of furniture assembly so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be even more pleased! The only thing slightly negative worth mentioning was the safety sticker was on the top of the table. I would‚Äôve left it if it was on the bottom side. I just used a hairdryer to warm up the sticker, though and it peeled off very easily.

I got this table to go between my bed and an exterior wall fits perfect and it was very easy to put together it looks great in my room

Assembled it myself which I never do!  It's great, sturdy & perfect for my needs

Perfect extension to my home office desk. Needed just a little more room.

this table arrived with many deep scratches in very visible places. it seems it's white under the  black coating, so they're extremely noticeable. I'm beyond disappointed that I spent almost $200 on a damaged product, but returning such a large, heavy item that I already began unboxing is just more hassle than I can deal with after having had a baby a few days ago.to add to my regret, this table is also cheaply made. finally, the instructions were vague, which led me to make a mistake at the beginning of construction and I had to take the whole thing apart and flip one of the components before putting it all back together.

I set it up first and it was Very wobbly had my husband who‚Äôs an engineer set it up again‚Ä¶ and it still sucks‚Ä¶ also it‚Äôs super light like linoleum

I'm really disappointed as I really wanted this to work.  Literally every single hole for the screws were either too small or way too big and when I tried to screw them in all the way, I had two of them with the head of the screw literally snap off before I gave up.  I thought initially that I might still be able to make it work if the screws weren't all the way into the wood but when trying to put pieces together, they wouldn't fit together cleanly.  Hoping I don't have an issue with UPS picking up since I may not be able to be here.  The only way I would ever reorder is if I had free assembly of the product.  That way I would have a professional to put to together and to send it back if there are manufacturing defects.  However I will not pay for assembly.

Received on June 7, 2024 put together love the look ,but as of today already scratched a piece of gray coming off very small, I really like this table not impressed with quality lasting ,seller please contact me .

The depth dimension are not 29.7" they are 19.7"Spent hours putting this together only to be duped with incorrect dimensions for the depth....

Not all the screws was right not fit right the parts

There are cracks within the boards. We couldn‚Äôt even put it together! This is a big let down.

for the price the materials are very cheap.will not last long.do not buy.it looks decent from afar and is pleasing to the eye but up close it's wobbly junk.and worst of all the tops do not align.bout 1/8th inch offset when closed .will make your OCD go to eleven. of it wasn't for the poor tolerances and gap between the tops I would have given a better review .still overpriced for the quality.just wasted 150 bucks. would add pictures but Amazon want too much permission to add photos.amazon just sucks all together.

The side piece arrived damaged

Put together easy enough, nut the shelf is less than 3mm thick, and its all partical board. Top lifts easy but it's flimsy, not stable.  One dowel was longer, and punctured hole clean through drawer front.  It looks nice, qne storage is good  but drawer bottom is flimsy

Wish I would have adhered to the negative reviews. This thing is worth, and I say this liberally, about $75. It took about 2 hours to put together. You can‚Äôt do everything with a power drill, but some. The thing is, it‚Äôs just another one of those cheap compressed wood pieces of crap furniture you can buy at Walmart for half the price. I‚Äôm good at assembling things and followed every step of the instructions. I had to redo several things over again even still. Now I am having to make screw adjustments as the instructions indicate to alleviate the crack in between the two sections of the top of the table. Just save yourself the headache. You‚Äôll find better quality at goodwill.

This is a good looking coffee table which is why I purchased it.  Due to the fact my husband was ill, I didn‚Äôt try to put it together before the return date. The directions are pictures only it is NOT easy to assemble, not as sturdy as I would expect for the price.  Overall, not a great purchase.  Look elsewhere.

Huge scratch on the top, was also extremely difficult and annoying to assemble, and there is no point in trying to return this thing because you have TO GLUE IT TOGETHER

Wood is cheap so it chips easy where you put nails in and Amazon had another sent to me but a rep canceled it for some dam reason.I want an exchange PERIOD not refund.

Missing parts and the springs for the lifting tables do not hold properly and are loose so the table will come down very quickly that is if you can get it to stay upright to begin with.mounting holes had to be re-drilled and done very carefully to avoid further damage to an already damaged table. No assistance when calling to complain.

It was $200!! It‚Äôs a piece of junk. Nothing lines up, and there isn‚Äôt a good way to adjust it. It came already damaged (when it finally arrived) and after assembly it doesn‚Äôt even really look all that good. It looks cheap. Dave your money and don‚Äôt buy this product üëé

CHEAP‚Äº‚ÄºHad for less than 6 months and with regular cleaning it wont hold up‚Äº

I'm replacing it after a month.The instructions were vague on several pages and the most important piece was installed backwards early on that was necessary to the raised tables aspect.If it weren't already glued and screwed, I'd return it. Instead, I'm just screwed. It also has an extremely ugly color and covering.

After repeatedly putting together and changing unit. The top pieces are not interchangeable...The unit does not WORK as printed!!

No instructions,so now what

Was sent an obviously used/returned coffee table. Parts were already partially installed, hardware came in a ripped up zip lock bag. Giant gouge out of the side piece. I paid for new, and got this?

Huge hole in the cheapers wood possible....no way to hide the damage once put together....Don't waste your time or money!!

Do not buy this coffee table. Poorly made. I spent hours assembling only to find that the holes needed to screw on the tops are not drilled.

Chipped and gouged pieces. Does not align properly when put together and folding top does not pop up and down easy. Only option is refund but You have to take apart item to ship back and it‚Äôs glued together. Customer service no existent

No instructions. Took 3+ people to put together. Box was ripped and taped upon arrival.

This is definitely not the color espresso. Very cheap materials. IKEA wouldn‚Äôt even seek this.

The lift tops slam open. I opened the lift top and it slammed open so hard it hit me and gave me a bruse.

Not easy to assemble, not sturdy, basically throw away furniture, would not recommend. You get what you pay for

Over priced.No quality check.

Table arrived early but damaged (scratched)

The table didn‚Äôt have all the pieces

The worst part‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt find out until you waste most of your time (most likely pre-dedicated to this task, at least that was the case for us.) We spent hours putting this together‚Ä¶ just to be disappointed in the end. Unfortunately this table has turned out to be a big tease. It seems like a great table, with easy instructions.. until you can not go any further, and you‚Äôre left with an eye sore, wasted time, and more work with breaking the table back down, and getting a new box to then ship it back to the sender‚Ä¶.I wish I had better things to say, based on some of the other reviews I initially saw. But those happy clients, had a different situation from myself. Unfortunately, this was a bad experience.

Received item shipped was quick...Unfortunately this product had 2 peices that the manufacturer had forgot to drill out. Poor quality control it took me some time to fix and drill out my own holes.. for the price we pay for these items i shouldn't have to do what the manufacturer should have. Anyone that has no woodworking skills might want to think twice

The table doesn‚Äôt open easily and it‚Äôs very wobbly so the whole point of the table is lost with how flimsy it is. There were some edges damaged as well

Missing screws broken boards

We bought this table just more than 3 months ago and loved it. I hadn‚Äôt really utilized the lift-up table part until today. When I went to put it down again, a spring broke off the table and it turned into a projectile and hit the wall and then hit my one year old son in the head. It‚Äôs lucky that it hit the wall first to soften the blow to my son, as it was very forceful. My son now has an abrasion on the side of his head from the impact. The time to return the table had now lapsed and we cannot return it. Beware of this table.

Some Dowel holes don't line up....The Dowels that do, have come thru the other side. Total waste of $200.00 Don't waste your money people.... If it wasn't such a big item to return I'd return it......

We got this table for our living room and it was not very sturdy at all once built. After only a week of having it the hinges got stuck and didn‚Äôt line up properly for the lift feature. Was overall disappointed with the table.

The table doesn‚Äôt have the mounting hardware installed, the unit is built and in my basement‚Ä¶ and is completely useless to continue building‚Ä¶ because the table top won‚Äôt even attach if you look at the pictures above. The inside base mounted holes‚Ä¶ the holes are not presses to to attach anything‚Ä¶ rendering this table a 249.00 piece of garbage. F I‚Äôm a single dad who has 2 kids.

great concept but the hinges are cheap. opening and closing the tops are sketchy and not smooth.

They didn't machine in the place to anchor the opening top. Returning this will be hell to take this apart and return.  Don't buy it

It is the worst thing I‚Äôve ever bought off Amazon. Hard to put together then broke as I was putting it together. Waste of $200.

Quality on this is subpar at best. Big hole in the table, went to the manufacturer, asked if they could replace this one piece versus having the whole table be garbage. Said no, offered me a 15% discount to keep the table that has a hole in it. üôÑ

Arrived destroyed and o oh able for refund if I pay the 50 dollars to ship it back.

These tables wear out fast. If you want something that lasts I don‚Äôt recommend this product

We haven‚Äôt even had this product for a year and the leg is peeling and breaking apart.  There is no way to get a hold of them.

This product looks nothing like the picture is not worth $220.00. You have to glue pieces. Do not purchase this product.

Sadly a piece was missing and another slightly damaged do I don‚Äôt know how it would have turned out.Too bad too. I was so excited about it and now I have to lug it to a mail king center

Very disappointed. Table is great but I was sent 3 J spring brackets instead of 2 I‚Äôs and 2 J‚Äôs, now lift top isn‚Äôt functional on one side and there‚Äôs no process in place for me to contact seller for help.

It took me 2:30 hrs to assemble so many screws and parts. It‚Äôs very flimsy mechanism plus very small even for a small condo the price is way way too much. The surface is prone to get scratched and damage with slightest pressure and hit. Will not recommend.

I absolutely love this Seventable Coffee Table! It is the perfect blend of modern style and functionality. The 47.2" size fits beautifully in my living room, providing ample space without overwhelming the area. The lift-top feature is incredibly useful, especially when I‚Äôm working from home or enjoying meals in front of the TV. The build quality is excellent‚Äîsturdy and durable, yet easy to assemble. Plus, the additional storage space is a game-changer, helping me keep my living room tidy and organized. Overall, this coffee table has exceeded my expectations and is well worth the price. Highly recommend!

Absolutely AMAZING table! It was the perfect size, such a fun, easy build and it‚Äôs very sturdy and easy to clean. It looks so sleek and beautiful and is amazing quality for the price. If you see any negative reviews about build difficulty, pay it no mind because those people just don‚Äôt know how to follow simple directions.The two options for what ways the table can open can get tricky so pay very close attention to the instructions on which option you choose because you‚Äôll have to swap the lift/lower pieces depending on them.Other than that this is absolutely worth.

I looked everywhere and I did not receive a manual to put this together. The website does not have the manual available to download and there‚Äôs a lot of parts so I‚Äôm kindve dead in the water till I get a response back. The packaging it arrived in was very damaged with a huge hole and it was taped very thoughtlessly and was falling apart when I picked it up. On the bright side You can tell the table itself is high quality and colors look amazing but I can‚Äôt even put it together so I don‚Äôt know if it even works or how it looks. So if I get a response I will change my review to 5 stars cuz the table is actually what I consider to be rated properly but y‚Äôall have to do better with shipping and attention to details for such a nice high quality looking table. Also it would be helpful to have a downloadable pdf on how to put the table together I case whoever is packing these forgets the manual like they did with mine.UPDATESo my brother came to the rescue and helped me to put it together without a manual. The company also reached out to me and sent me a pdf a day or so later with the Manual. The reason I changed it to 4 stars is solely because of the table, this thing is very nice and works perfectly. All my frustration went away when it was put together cuz it‚Äôs really a beautiful table. Honestly everything about this table is amazing but whoever handles the shipping and packing really needs to take it up a notch. If there was even half the amount of energy put into the shipping and packing as there was the actual quality of the table it would be an easy 5 stars for me. I changed it from 1 star to four stars because the table really is awesome. Just please match the energy at least a little with the shipping and handling and you will have a super solid 5 star product.

This is a great coffee table. It's  study, pretty easy to put together, looks great, and has lots of storage.

Pieces came in undamaged from shipping, fortunately. I'm 27f and worked on this by myself while very sick (I don't recommend, that was a highly psychotic.)The instruction manual was easy enough to follow, however there was on step that could have been more clear (the divider between the cubbies on the top). I ended up having to carefully undo what I did, but I managed to fix it.The one issue I had was with one of the holes for the metal pieces that attach to the inside of the cubby. The hole to screw this in was unthreaded.I had my bf do some DIY the next day (I was veerryy sick), and he drilled new holes to make it more secure.Overall, I really to love this piece of furniture and will have to get a rug or something underneath it to keep from moving.

The quality was better then what I expected.  This cocktail table is perfect! I am very glad that I ordered it. The style and functionality is fantastic! It fits perfectly with my living room decor.  I love this table!!

It is beautiful when assembled! Worked perfect with my kitchen nook!

The color is spot on, it's an easy clean for when my 2 year old spills anything on it. It's smooth and a great size. I'm a sucker for multiple storage placements and it's easy to access any drawer. The top when you pull it up doesn't feel at sturdy but not a huge concern since the wood isn't heavy.

Had a bit of an adventure with this product. After using it a week or so I'm happy with the build and sturdiness. The lift tops works fairly smoothly, support a good amount of weight, and feel secure. Assembly took a bit if effort but worth the savings. Only complaints are that the top surface tends to keep marks from oil/sweat on your hands, and there weren't enough sticker covers for all the exposed screw holes in the storage area under the lift tops.If you're getting it delivered to your home, the box isn't inconspicuous so I recommend being there to receive it. Had my first package stolen.My replacement arrived damaged, unfortunately. One corner was pretty beat up. I've realized after the fact that I could've reached out to the seller directly to get damaged parts replaced, but I ended up going through Amazon for another replacement which worked out finally. Not a fun process trying to re-package the parts in the busted box though.

Love this coffee table! Looks just like the ad.Be aware that you will need to put this whole thing together. It took just over an hour for my handy husband to do it. But otherwise it's fantastic! The putting it together is the only thing keeping it from 5 stars. Great storage, not too heavy but still sturdy.

Was so excited to put this together but got to the last step and found that the piece that the screws need to go into were missing. I looked at all my hardware stores and couldn't find even a nut that would fit it. So disappointed that now I can't do anything, cant return due to it being glued and way to big to return. :(

Crap Flimsy Walmart type furniture

For 200 bucks I'd like to think things would line up a bit better.  I messed with the tops for a solid hour trying to get the seam where the two meet to line up straight and tighter to no avail. I will probably buy a new top and make it one solid piece because it's definitely an eye sore.

4 Anchor screws snapped at top with just regular torque from screwdriver. The cheap board split several places where screws go in .Legs ding with the slightest touch to reveal paper like particle board underneath. After waiting 10 days for SUPPOSED prime shipping extremely disappointed with low quality item. I don't see this lasting long.

Part G arrived damaged on the corner and a few other parts had minor damage as well. Noticed while building

Table is light gray, top of table wobbles when lifting. Would not buy again

Table is smaller then I thought! Finish is not what was expected and the springs jack the tops around out of alinement after a few uses.Oh and it cost a little to much. Would beBetter deal under 150.00 dollars.

Directions had a very crucial arrow sticker. Which was put on the wrong side of the directed board and now my hinges will not mount correctly.  Im at as what to do. Ugh

We were so excited to order this coffee table, we noticed immediately two cracks on the bottom drawers.

I tried following all steps but couldn‚Äôt fix and still it‚Äôs halfway. God knows why these people have made so difficult to assemble. Highly disappointed

Not made very well

Doesn‚Äôt sit flat on top.  Uneven.  Serves its purpose though.  Kinda complicated

I love the table but it doesn't set flush on top like it is supposed to

No mounting holes inside end section to hang table hinges

Cheap pressed board for entire product. Paid twice as much as its worth.

I feel very disappointed as I had to out the whole table together to realize the final pieces are missing and the side of the table has no screw points for the lift mechanism. Very disappointed because the quality is good but I would be worried to order a new one

I do extensive research before I buy things online. This coffee table has great reviews. I will say I‚Äôm disappointed. It is all pressboard that marks and breaks easily. One board arrived already broken (the box was fine so didn‚Äôt happen due to shipping). When you put the hardware in it rips up the pressboard. I mean, most of these places are hidden but it makes it feel really cheap. When put together it looks decent but I‚Äôm really not impressed. I‚Äôm not sure I would recommend this to anyone else.

Table top dosent line up I try to make it straight but without modifying the brackets you can't do it. And the lifting mechanism it's a little hard to pull and flimsy.

First one was okay, was a pain in the bottom to put it together.Second one i purchased for my uncle didn't include the hardware kit. Amazon won't send out a hardware kit, and i destroyed the packaging while taking it apart.If you decide to purchase this product, I recommend you Unbox it properly, incase something is missing & need to return it.

Quite disappointed overall with this purchase. Not really good value for money. It would be quite a hassle to return since it's now assembled so this is definitely a loss.Assembly 4/5: instructions were clear and it was straightforward to assemble, although time consuming.Aesthetic 1/5: surface scratches extremely easily from any material and with minimal contact. It's also difficult to level the top tables so that they are flush with respect to each other so it doesn't look so great symmetrically. Legs scratch the floors very easily as well with minimal movement so be careful if you don't have a carpet.Functional 2/5: movement of table top is not fluid whatsoever, quite abrupt. Although it is fairly sturdy when in upper position.

I would not recommend.  I would like to return it but it‚Äôs all put together.  Do they take it back?  Box is gone.  The sliders also need to be changed as they are so cheaply made and will break.  Can I return this piece of junk without the box?

Around Ikea quality.  The two tops do not line up  one side seems to always sit higher and it's impossible to grt them even.  We've been trying for almost an hr now.  Came with 'extra hardware' there wasn't enough hardware even with thr extra.  There's some kind of white scuff mark on the top larger part that doesn't fully come off.  The smaller side springs open so quickly you'll get knocked out if your not paying attention and because of it being so forceful to open its impossible to keep aligned with the larger side.Colour is nice size is nice unfortunately I'm not happy with the price I paid for it.

The table is very nice and is easy to assemble, however the manufacturing messed up the pre drilled holes for the top of the table and was unable to finish it without making alterations.

When assembling I found that there was no predrilled holes to connect the hinges for the larger side of table. Had to do it myself and buy screws to attach as well. Was not happy... I finally got it done after 6 hours.

I love it but my problem I can‚Äôt assemble it properly. I did my best but still not perfect, let me know if you can help please

The color is TOTALLY wrong!!-i bought this thinking it would match the FARMHOUSE style TV stand w/remote control fireplace-however it's a weird greyish beige color of that makes sense& it's NOT really FARMHOUSE style as I would say it's MORE modern& plain!!-i don't understand why the drawers open to the opposite side of the pull out table tops!?-i wanted the drawers to be accessible when I'm sitting on my couch& thought the table top would pull it towards ME -therefore creating a table top to eat meals/snacks!!-however, they definitely are NOT stable enough to hold ANY food or drink items!!& don't seem that they were intended for that purpose???!!!-i guess they just pull out to create a hiding spot for storage -however I'm not sure what you'd wanna store it's pretty shallow& why would it have the side table that pulls up& out to the side-which i thought would be for the'chase'section of my couch!!I've seen MANY other tables that seem MORE appropriate to my needs/wants for way better prices!!-too bad I already paid someone to assemble & the packaging thrown out!!STILL hoping I can sell& get something more fitting as it's ALSO too long for my new 'L'(or chase -sofa)shaped couch-something else I'm not happy with - didn't buy on HERE -wishing I did!!I guess I don't really have any other complaints -it could be way worse-at least it functions-JUST not the way I imagined it did-maybe it's my fault-i tend to OVER shop/research overwhelming myself& ending up ordering the wrong items!!- definitely need to pay MORE attention to details for now on!!-live and learn, right!?-i hope this helps-i WILL try again to upload pics-it's not allowing ME to right NOW  ï‚Å†‡≤†‚Å†_‚Å†‡≤†‚Å† îmahola aloha stay stoked ~MoSurfs73~

All in all I like the table very nice take it from me do not assemble by yourself very hard to assemble directions I don't find that easy I purchased a lot of items from Amazon and usually never have this much trouble it took me two days to put this together

To start, it‚Äôs not made of wood, it‚Äôs more like plastic vinyl or something, so fingerprints and other dirt cake on and are easily seen. The larger table top piece and smaller table top piece may move independently of each other but it‚Äôs not smooth and you have to lift from the absolute center. If you life the corner, just the corner lifts and then the pieces also close on each other, they almost overlap. The transition to move upwards is not clean, it more snaps up. And you have to use two hands because it is actually kind of difficult to lift them up, they don‚Äôt want to move. My last table with lifting top was so smooth. It was an ikea table and you could lift from any side and it would gently lift upwards. Overall I‚Äôm not a fan and would recommend finding something better.

It‚Äôs a quality table, just lacking some forethought to really make it able to be set up properly. I wanted to have the drawers in this coffee table facing the couch, and have the smaller side section open to the left. But the only way to have the smaller section open to the left was to have the drawers facing away. And the only way to have the drawers face the couch, is to have the smaller section open to the right. Bad design. It would have been super easy to add these threaded inserts to both ends of the table to allow for any configuration necessary. Some measurements and drilling and using unused inserts from the underside of the larger tabletop section has me up and running in the configuration necessary, but it was just aggravating to assemble the whole table only to find out the designers left out a few inserts that would have allowed for total customization of the table. Measurements for those interested. Center inserts are 8.5‚Äù in from the sides and 2 3/8‚Äù from the top, and 5/8‚Äù from the groove for the platform under the tabletops. And the side inserts are 2 5/32‚Äù from each side, and the same vertical measurements from top and groove.

Even with the directions, it's still possible to put a piece in the wrong way as we found out.  Thankfully the glue they want you to use hadn't dried yet.  Then one of the lids had the risers on wrong but according to directions were correct.  The small one btw.  Recommend only gluing one side of the dowel in so it can come apart if needed.  If not, you can always go back with better glue like gorilla glue and make sure those joints don't move at all.  Would still buy again but pay to have it put together next time.

It is a nice looking product but takes a VERY long time to put together, I don‚Äôt almost. 3 hrs on it. Also it is a bit smaller than it looks in the picture. Very cute though.

The table looks great put together but it is missing peices a n d some of the needed holes are not drilled in. I am not able to completely use the table as intended at this time. The top peice can not not lift up because it is not screwed in. There were no holes to screw the top cover to the base. It is really disappointing.

Would be great if the lift mechanism wasn't so flimsy and it came forward more.  On the lift mechanism each side can move independently, there is no support bar between them and you have to lift it on both sides or dead in the center.  Same way to go down.  It also comes forward about 5" less than my old lift table.  Ended up just restoring my old lift table as all these ones on Amazon I've seen have the same awful lift mechanisms.

I love this coffee table and the functionality and  storage but it‚Äôs definitely not espresso brown like the description indicates.

It came in a lot of pieces and then there was no one to help put it together.

It's a really nice looking table but it already has a few spots that expanded because my autistic son drools when he draws and I don't always see it instantly. I also had to take out the springs because it kept flipping up and hitting us when we would walk past if we touched it and my son got hurt sitting next to it when it flipped up and hit him in the head because his shoulder bumped it while he was watching TV. Springs out it works ok just the issue of do not allow any moisture near it or the press board it's made out of expands and looks like crap.

It's not a bad table, although the lifted tops can be kinda wobbly when you open them, but the biggest issue I have is that the corner protectors it comes with do not adhere to the table AT ALL, they keep falling off and the corners are incredibly sharp.

Just past the window to return this item and it‚Äôs started peeling and cracking at the corners. I really like this coffee table but in terms of longevity I don‚Äôt think this holds up. The layer directly underneath the surface is like a cardboard particleboard blend.

First off I was super pissed because it was suppose to be delivered on the 20th and got here after Xmas on the 28th. I will say this though, never had easier, right to the point assembly instructions on anything. They were step by step, clear and precise and it took me about 90 minutes to put together while watching TV. Everything lined up and it‚Äôs very sturdy for what I paid.

It wasn‚Äôt very clear from the description but this table has a laminate finish, no wood grain texture or detailing. Overall it looks pretty cheap. The two top pieces didn‚Äôt line up, so I contacted the seller and they were very responsive and helpful.

When I initially bought this, I thought it looked like a good sturdy table. Two months in, the entire table collapsed when I was trying to work on my laptop . No extra weight, etc on the table, but when I went to examine further, several nails came loose and separated table pieces from each other, and others snapped completely off! From simple every day use, to a completely useless table. Good thing you have a warranty- I need a whole new table now . Ugh

I had to hire two handymen to assemble this coffee table. It took them two hours straight working together to finish it. There were no parts missing and it looks nice. I have assembled all kinds of things, but one look at all of the parts and I had to hand this one to the pros!

After purchasing this coffee table, I see one almost identical, the other has a 1 piece top, and metal legs. Almost $100 cheaper. The picture trying to sell this product is very nice. As a furniture re-finisher, and upholsterer of 20+ years do yourself a favor and pass on this expensive laminated wood.

This table looks nice but looks cheap.  I just wanted something that didn't cost $1000.  It works for what it is intended, but it is very hard to put together.  If you are a novice please hire a handy man to assemble.

Needed a table fast. This table is good in a pinch but not quality. The lamination/ coating of the table is easily scratched or ruined. Set a luke warm plate on it and now has a white circle where it was. Hinges for the top are wobbly and don't close properly after a few times. Does have plenty of storage though.

Table is great and quite easy to put together. On the other hand customer service sucks! Few parts came damaged and I can't get ahold of anyone to get them replaced! Instructions manual says replacement parts are free of charge but there no one to speak with!

Returned more than month ago. Return still not received by seller. No refund to date for me. Item does not work in only available spot I have.

Expresso color for lift top coffee table was not as described. Also Bought expresso night stand and that was the right expresso color.

Nice once was put together.

Looks difficult to put together So there for its still sitting in a box

Works pretty crappy as well

UPDATE:  The company did reach out after my previous review and gave me a partial refund for the broken piece.  Very appreciated.  However, they stated there is only one way to set up the table regardless of the attached photo.  So still, if you would like the configuration pictured in my screenshot, do not purchase this one.We bought this specifically because we could get the configuration circled in the screenshot.  After trying EVERYTHING we determined they just reversed the photo and you cannot actually set up the table this way. VERY disappointing.  Also, a piece arrived cracked. The crack goes halfway through the wood.  Thankfully, it is just the back of the drawer so I put some glue on it since it won't be seen and it shouldn't be holding much weight or anything so it should be ok.  I tried to contact the seller but could not find a way to do so.  It s a nice table if you want it the way it is pictured in the very first photo but I'm very disappointed considering the price.  Not worth it for this price in my opinion.  DO NOT BUY if you are looking for any other configuration.

Okay just off I love the design, I love the piece and I am happy with the purchase. I love that it came with screwdriver and extra pieces. It was package well and arrived quickly. Okay the negatives!There was way more installation then I expected. You are building the piece 100%. It was not as easy as people and the company state. It took me almost 5 hours to put together. It was overwhelming at times. I did read the reviews so I knew there was work but I assumed they would have done a little bit more. The reviewer who stated it was "ikea" is bang on. I would add slightly harder than ikea piece but it was not extremely difficult. It was hard though! However, it can be looked at piece of pride- I made that The instructions were very confusing at times and I had a repeat page making it extra confusing.I did not have the trouble with the wooden dowels as many people stated; however, I did make sure they fit before gluing and attaching.Okay my three big pet peeves with this piece 1. the shelving base for the drawers are extremely thin (about 1 to 2cm and it was flimsy). the material greatly limits what you can store. I was expecting the base of the drawers to be thicker. If you are hoping to store heavier items tucked away this is not the piece. The ad shows storing heavy candles and heavier pieces. I would not trust the bottoms with heavier items such as jar candles as they will eventually cause sagging 2. the instructions to attach the hinges / top was very confusing it took me an extra hour to figure it out. This was noted in the reviews 3. although 1 person can put this together, it really should be two unless you have good upper body strength. There was a couple dear Jesus help me moments.Now the big question would I buy it again knowing what I now know? If the price was $100 cheaper it would make the installation and frustrations worth it. if they did more installation for you it would be worth the price.

Table came with manufactured issues but after fixed I‚Äôm happy

When they open they are not very solid

I love the table the only thing is I fond is smaller than the picture. I know I need to pay more attention to the measurement  details. Nice table quality is the same as what you would get at wallmart.  Do feel the price should reflect that.

Dislikes: was slow to ship.The edges are all scuffed like they tried to sand the laminateLift top is difficult to closeInstructions show to put foam pads in wrong locationLikes: fairly easy to assemble. Lift top can open both ways (towards and away from drawers) lots of storage perfect for our laptop, notepads and one section designated for diapers and wipes üòÖ

Note to anyone who reads this: Don‚Äôt ever try putting this together with a really bad migraine or you get what‚Äôs pictured above. I‚Äôve been trying to get it back apart just to flip it around is all I have to do but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to the point where I‚Äôm pretty tempted to just return it. I don‚Äôt know what to do I can‚Äôt use power it stripped the screws a little a rubber mallet can only take you so far and it‚Äôs heavy trying to get it back to the post office should be fun. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth it. So if you‚Äôre putting it together please make sure you do it right the first time or it‚Äôs quite the hassle especially when it‚Äôs just you doing everything. I would really like to just fix it and keep it. We‚Äôll see

One of the grommets that the screw screws into on the coffee table is missing so the lift top, larger top is not stable. Could you send a grommet so I can insert it into the hole where the grommet should be. Otherwise the table is perfect.

Sizing of the towels could‚Äôve been a little bit more accurate! I have a bunch of holes sticking out where the dowels ripped through. It looks horrible. Tried to contact the seller but they won‚Äôt take it back when it‚Äôs all in place.

It was way too hard to put together and one of the pieces broke in half because it had no support around it.  In the end. The table protrudes on inch in the front and one inch in the back depending on which side you look at it from.  The small part protrudes in the front and the large side in the back.

Material not too sturdy. Table top seems wobbly and finicky. Assembly was too complex.

Love the color and style. Did not like how time consuming it was to assemble. Did not like the material it is made of. Chips easily. The patches that were sent to hide the screws are of a different color.

Hard to  assemble and the table tops are so wiggly

The table, once it‚Äôs built, is nice. The box came damaged but none of the major pieces were damaged inside, however one of the handles came broken. I did hear back from the company initially but I am still waiting to get a timeline on a replacement part. You think for such an expensive product the company would be more on top of their customer service.Update: the company did issue me a full refund after waiting for two weeks to hear back

I like the looks and functional use of the cubby space but the top lids are very loose and sloppy when opening and closing

Assembly took a while but was easy to follow instructions. Sturdy. Looks good. Happy until the last piece went on and it does not sit flush with the table or align well with the other lift top piece beside it once placed back into the down position. Very noticeable gap difference from one end of the table to the other and does not look good :( . Was so disappointed by this as now it makes the whole table look defective and cheap.

I thought this table looked perfect i.n the ads for what we wanted.  Unfortunately this item was very high priced and the material is not real would even.  The was the most disappointing.  When the lis is lifting it wobbles and is not sturdy at all.

Had to drill holes to attach the top. It was Missing screw holes and set in nuts on one side. Tried to switch the panels and this didn‚Äôt work as it didn‚Äôt line up with the shelves

Remaining aware of the price point of this item the hinge quality needs upgrading.

Looks good, Ikea stuff... the one smalltop is really not in its place, tried everything, it will not place itself even with the the bigger one... Like the spaces savers for putting away books and more.... especially in a small cottage...

not as easy as they say to put together, top panels has lots of holes to screw spring unites to, but no markings to tell you what holes are the right ones. Trial and error tell you get it right.

I do really like this table. I was able to put it together myself. I will say that when it comes to the instructions, pictures of the parts could be a bit more accurate, but besides that when comparing putting this item together vs other products, this one was quite straightforward.

EDIT: I‚Äôve learned that the included screws go INSIDE the hex screws. I never even thought of that as a possibility or experienced it in any other building project but who cares! Just glad the table will go together now! Changing my review to 4 stars because while some of this assembly is a bit wonky, its now the quality i expected and im happy with the purchase.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîAs some of the other one star reviews have noted, the hardware this table comes with doesn‚Äôt actually connect to the brackets. The holes in the lid come pre drilled with hex screws in them but you‚Äôre supposed to use the screws provided. Unfortunately the pre drilled holes are too big for the screws and the hex screws that are currently there are too big to fit through the hardware. This makes the table top impossible to attach this making the table useless. I do NOT recommend buying as the hinge top was the main reason i got this table and now it is useless as provided.

I like that it opens two ways. We put some motion sensor lights inside so it wasn‚Äôt so dark. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that it shows every finger print.

The directions were not easy to follow, at the point of hinges‚Ä¶other than that we like it!

I love the idea of the opposite side table trays.  Genius!  However, it is not sturdy at all.Table top does not close evenly. I have to press it down and no, there is nothing in the bottom storage to keep it from closing.  On opening the tables they shift so you have to have a really good grip so they don't twist.Overall I like the look of the table . Very pretty and a good size. it does need to be taller, though. I have to bend over to eat and I am super short.

Only thing I dislike is a drawer of mine was damaged during shipment. I just got to building it. Overall a it has a beautiful color and has great storage space.

Overall this is a great coffee table. I tried to find a ‚Äúwood‚Äù material table  to match the rest of my furniture, but this one had the drawers and tops I was looking for.However, the top smudges very easy. Not sure if it‚Äôs just the black color or what. Even with the cleanest of hands, you leave behind a finger print. Which I obviously don‚Äôt want when I entertain. So  I ended up purchasing a wood vinyl on Amazon for $5 to cover the top with and I think in comparison it looks a lot better, more expensive and most importantly, no finger prints. Happy customer.

LOVE the way the top raises up to use w my laptop or doing work on a desk. Made well. Just HATED the 36 pages of instructions to assemble it!

The piece came in and I started putting it together almost immediately. I was super excited. However, fast forward to 1030pm, took it apart 3 times and finally said I‚Äôll try again tomorrow, was EXTREMELY upset to find out that the trays DO NOT assemble on left OR right. It‚Äôs literally turn the entire piece around so I can have the small piece open on the left instead of the right and the big piece can either go forward towards the drawers or backwards, away from the drawers. But that small piece, only goes RIGHT unless you turn and face the drawers towards the couch. üôÑ. I am keeping it because it is decent quality, heavy, and sturdy. I‚Äôll live with the drawers facing the wrong way

I love the way it fits right in our living room style wise. I was excited by the storage and the way the top lifts up, providing two separate work areas. It was tough to put together and even with making four adjustments, my husband couldn't get the one side to lay flush with the other side as it should be.EDIT: The issue with the one side not laying flush resolved itself. I put a runner and a candle plate with candle on it. Just a little something to keep the top protected and a little decorative something. The one side settled and is flush with the other. Evidently it just needed to sit for a day.

Instructions were super easy to understand and put together. I had to buy more wood glue. I received 2 bottles with this shipment but one was super hard. But it‚Äôs ok. I just bought Gorilla wood glue from Wal-Mart for a couple bucks.This looks almost exactly like the one I wanted from Ashley furniture but for about $400 cheaper!! I didn‚Äôt like how it chipped as shown in my first picture, but it‚Äôs on the inside so no one can see itHopefully it withholds and last a while

Works great

I love this coffee table.  Works for me and it's beautiful.  It's pretty sturdy and came together fairly quickly.  I am only giving it a 4 because once put together the 2 sections on top don't exactly line up.  It's a small enough difference that I don't think anyone else notices but I do.

I assemble furniture for a company so this was easy for me.  May take someone a couple hours to put together.  Not enough wood glue included for my liking.  With that said, absolutely love it.  ‚ù§Ô∏è

It didn't come in the grey that I ordered. But overall still love it

The last step to the assembly is to loosen screws and adjust the final placement of the parts comprising the top of the table.  As a person who suffers from OCD, I have found this last step to be impossible to accomplish.  I have enlisted the help of a handyman and still have been unable to align the two parts the way the assembly guide instructs you too.  The final product is annoying to look at for me, but would likely not annoy the average person, so I'm leaving the rating at 4 stars.

Top when you lift up is wobblely,looks nice but just be careful opening up the tops

I liked that this was relatively easy to assemble.  I didn't run into any issues during the assembly process and there were even a couple spare parts (hardware).  It looks nice but the only fallback is the tabletop lifting hinges are a little flimsy.  I have another lift top and the hinges on it are solid.  Still a good piece for the price.

Had to take it apart before adding the hinged table tops because I had a board flip flopped in the middle.got it taken apart enough to flip the board correctly only to see a wooden dowel and it an ugly knot in the table. Husband said it was because I didn‚Äôt have it pushed in all the way, but I‚Äôm 99.99% certain I did. Either way. That sucks, great otherwisw

Product is not of the highest quality but is good for the price. Pretty easy assembly and instructions.

The quality is pretty good for the price but this took me about 2 hours to put together. Took over 30 steps, and I would say about similar to how long it takes to build Ikea furniture

Coffee table/ couch lunchThe sturdiness of the lift top is wobbly?? But it's a value for the money!! It fits my taste just fine!! No kids to worry abt breaking it, just a rough husband !!!

It‚Äôs a little shakier than expected but was easy to assemble

As others have stated, the instructions/illlustrations could be better.  Once assembled, for me this is a very utilitarian table.  Love the compartments and draws.  Gives me a place to put all the incidentals I use quite regularly out of site yet right at hand...  Not a high quality piece.  Made of fiber board of some kind.  Great for my uses without spending a lot of money

It is sturdy, has an excellent design to enhance the room, has plenty of storage, and tops rise which is nice when working from home and not wanting to sit at the desk.

This table is really neat.  Very nicely made & sturdy.  I would have gave it a solid 5 stars but the little part of the top table will not lay flat.  We have tried everything.Bought as a wedding gift to my daughter & son in law.  They really like it.  Only wish the one top would lay flat.

It's a decent coffee table but a little small. Not too hard to assemble and all the pieces fit, fiber board with veneer. The veneer does not seem very scratch resistant, and definitely use coasters or it will bubble and peel with liquid on it.

Although I would have liked the coffee table to look more like real wood, it is functional. Instructions were detailed, extensive, and clear. Bring your own screwdriver; The one included will tear up your hands. The two parts of the top matched up perfectly. Nice size. Height is perfect.

over all this is great! but unfortunately one of the springs are slightly broken and they don‚Äôt replace parts and i‚Äôm certainly not taking this thing apart and shipping. i‚Äôd love to just get the spring i need for it to work as is should. looks wonky now

This table is great! Just have 3-4 hours to put it together. It's like one of the "ikea" furniture you've heard about. Came with all hardware and then some. Have an electric screwdriver and definitely another person to help! Overall it's amazing

Overall this is a good coffee table. I hate that it has a long wide crack that runs down the center of the table. The pre drilled holes dont allow the table to come together evenly on top of the table. When the table tops lift up they really spring up fast and hard.

We‚Äôre really happy with the table. We were able to customize the opening of the top for our living room layout, so that is a major plus!  Lots of storage and it looks nice, too. (It‚Äôs not solid wood and won‚Äôt fool anyone into thinking it is, but it doesn‚Äôt look cheap.). Assembly was a little confusing but we figured it out thanks to the excellent diagrams in the booklet.

This coffee table looks good in our space. However, due to the table not being made of wood, we're concerned about accidental water rings.  You have to be careful when raising and lowering the sides. Overall, good value for the price.

Overall I really love this table. It was easy to assemble if you follow the directions. It took me a couple hours to assemble, but I did it alone and wasn't trying to rush through the assembly process. It looks really nice, but the top already has a few scuffs on it from water bottles.

This table is very easy to install and I love the color. It fits perfectly in the center of my living room. The draws work fine and my family really likes the different parts that lift up. A table I would recommend.

I liked that it included everything needed for assembly

Only issue I have is that the side table doesn't match up to the other table once it's assembled.  It's not off too much, but enough that it's noticeable.

Hinges are stiff on tops, but the amount of storage is good for being a small table.

Good instructions but this one part was drilled incorrectly so I had to drill holes myself.

Hard assembly-works great with sectional

The table looks to be of good quality but it's too complicated for me to assemble. I will have to pay someone to do that Maybe rate the difficulty of assembly in your ads.

Took more time and work then I expected!

Assembly was pretty straight forward with the instructions provided.. Table seems to be of good quality for what it is..

Looks wonderful!! So very happy to have gotten this. And at a great price!! Winning!!

Good storage, scuff marks on one piece and pads #6 are missing

Instructions not as clear as you would like if you make a mistake you can't fix t because every thing is glued

This was not hard to put together. I even swapped out the opening way to try it both ways.

Absolutely AMAZING table! It was the perfect size, such a fun, easy build and it‚Äôs very sturdy and easy to clean. It looks so sleek and beautiful and is amazing quality for the price. If you see any negative reviews about build difficulty, pay it no mind because those people just don‚Äôt know how to follow simple directions.The two options for what ways the table can open can get tricky so pay very close attention to the instructions on which option you choose because you‚Äôll have to swap the lift/lower pieces depending on them.Other than that this is absolutely worth.

I was a little worried about putting it together because I read reviews of parts being damaged, and reviews of needing two people to put it together. There were no damaged parts, and I‚Äôm a 51yo female and put it all together alone, and it wasn‚Äôt difficult. I will say the last two steps, attaching the ‚Äúrisers‚Äù for the tops to the almost completed table, were the trickiest, but just require patience. I highly suggest following the instructions step by step, use the pictures as a guide and make sure the screws that you put in first are straight. I‚Äôm also so happy I didn‚Äôt need to use my drill because I have a drilling disability! I did use my own screwdriver which isn‚Äôt fancy by any means, I think it just fit the screws better. Anyway, I‚Äôm very excited to have done this by myself. From start to finish it took 4.5 hours, however I took a few breaks to step away from it, plus I took a lunch break. Without those, I think it would‚Äôve taken me 3-3.5 hours.

This table is super easy to put together.  The parts are nicely packaged and the manual is very easy to understand.  I only ran into one little issue at the end when I realized that I put part A in the wrong way.  It wasn‚Äôt very clear on which way it goes in and I had to come read another users review to find out what I did wrong.  So if you get to the end and things don‚Äôt square up, it‚Äôs probably part A, which is easy to fix.  Aside from that, it was super easy and I love the table.  It lifts up to the perfect height when sitting on the couch and looks really nice.

I don‚Äôt normally write the instruction book over the product, but this instruction book was very detailed and very simple to follow. I did it by myself without any assistance and it worked great.

The parts came well packaged and nothing was damaged. Directions were very good and all parts were labeled. Did not have to do any guessing! Everything lined up well, too.

Previously, we had a very large roll about coffee table that took up quite a bit of space and required 2 people to lift and move - plus it had a very dark brown color (and the rest of our furniture items were lighter in color).We wanted something that was lighter in both color and weight and after checking out many options, we selected this Seventable design on Amazon.I was surprised at the number of parts that came with the unit, and when you first see all the parts, you may feel a bit intimidated at first.  Just follow the instruction which is set up in easy steps and everything will go together smoothly.  The even give you some extra parts in case you screw up or break something.  But do be advised, however, that this project may take several hours.The only difficulty I had - which was probably due to my perceptions - was when the adjustable and swing away table tops had to be installed, which is the last step of the process.  That actually was the longest part of the installation, which it shouldn't have been.  All in all, it took me 2-3 hours to complete everything, which I felt was a bit long.If put together properly, you will find that this coffee table is superbly constructed, solid, and very flexible - meaning all the things you can store in it.  We're glad we purchased it.Normally we steer clear of particle board furniture, but this particular piece is actually well constructed and should last a long time.

The assembly was long but I have very little experience. Step by step I finished it and I‚Äôm really happy

Easy to put together, super cute

I like the table. It was a while to put together. If you just follow the instructions step-by-step it‚Äôs OK. The instructions are very vague about the bumper pads for the top covers. Make sure when you put them on there 2 inches in on both corners.

I had my eye on this table for awhile. I wanted to try a lift top table and it works great. My husband said it was easy to assemble. It‚Äôs got lots of storage. The price varies quite a bit, from $135-209 so watch before you purchase.

We needed to upgrade our family room table and this was perfect.  We were using food tables and this took care of that while also providing storage space and also being just a bit more aesthetically pleasing.

Really nice product. Absolutely changed my leisure space. I've been wanting one for a long time, but this is the first one I saw that wrapped around the corner and it fits our living room perfectly.

I absolutely love my new coffee table! It is beautiful and of good quality. The hardware was all labeled and in individual bags. It even has an extra bag of extra hardware and a cute little screwdriver included. I‚Äôm a 44 YO F and put this together all by myself. Instructions are very clear and easy to follow. The top pieces lift without difficulty. I definitely recommend this table.

This table is nice and has a lot of utility. Its very sturdy, though raise and lower with 2 hands. The assembly is a bit of a master's program but likewise, it is quite engenius the way it comes together.

I was looking for a small decent little coffee table for my apartment that had a lift top and wouldn't break the bank. I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the materials and the relative ease of putting it together. I don't put a whole lot of things together but in less than two hours and 35 steps later I was able to get it together. The only portion I needed a second person for was mounting the table top brackets into the table. I'm not sure how one person is supposed to do it. The table has a decent heft to it and I'm pleased with the overall style of it. I also like that it has a decent amount of storage space with the two drawers the shelf and the storage inside the table. Very happy with my purchase!

I ordered this on a Wednesday and it was delivered that Friday.It was well packaged and although the box showed a little rough handling. The table inside was fine.I've worked as a handyman for 40+years. Sometimes I assemble furniture for my customers and have learned to both follow instructions and to be leary of them.These instructions are -spot on- .They are easy to follow and the pictures are accurate.Even with several interruptions. I  put this together in just over 1 hour.Uninterrupted, someone with mechanical savvy should be able to assemble this in 40 to 60 minutes. A novice in about an hour and a half.The parts and hardware packets are well labeled and the counts are accurate.There's also a "spare parts" bag. Just in case.They supplied clear plastic corner guards as an option but didn't mention them in the directions that I saw.Once assembled,  the table feels more solid than I expected after watching a few video reviews.The lift tops and drawers move smoothly and easily.Only time will tell how durable this is but after putting it together. I  believe it will last a long time.

So glad I bought this. It‚Äôs so cute. I have a small living room, so I thought it was going to take up a majority of the space, but it ended up being the perfect size. I have a 5x8 rug underneath and I wanna say it‚Äôs about 1/4 the size of that. It took me a couple hours to put together. I was intimidated. It had a few pieces I‚Äôve never used before in my furniture assembly experience lol‚Ä¶ but once I got going it wasn‚Äôt so bad. Also, I love that they provided plenty of extras for just in case. I‚Äôm the type to notice minor imperfections.. and there were a couple, but nothing major whatsoever. It was packaged really well. Overall very happy. We really needed this. Especially with the lift top. It‚Äôs perfect. The full table kind would‚Äôve been too much for our space.

My original review wasn't very good , I also felt trapped because the table was put together and I couldn't see how i could return it . But it is very important that now I rewrite my review because of how well they have treated me and how fast they corrected the situation and made it right in just a matter of days !!!!  As soon as i wrote about my situation with the table , Seven Warrior immediately contacted me and wanted to see what they could do to correct it . They asked for some pictures to see the problem , and then shipped me a brand new table which I received in just a couple of days . They were also going to contact the manufacturer about what i had en-counted during assembly .  I want to thank them for correcting my situation so fast and I will not hesitate to order from them again knowing they are always looking to make things right ... Unhappy to a very Happy customer .....Thank you

It is a wonderful table

very good coffee table, easy assembly instructions.need two people to install.Value for money.

Seems to be solid construction. Like the lifts to bring table up to a higher level. color is a very pleasing gray

I love how organized the  pieces were and the hardware.  It takes two people to put it together and it does take awhile.  But it is beautiful!

Looks great but not as grey as I had imagined. It‚Äôs more of a beige color so does not match the other furniture I had bought.

It‚Äôs not the fanciest table out there but it‚Äôs gorgeous, matches description, affordable and relatively easy to assemble. I did it alone and it took me about 3 hours. I‚Äôm sure with power tools and help it would be done in 1 hour or so. I was hoping the top goes higher but it still does the job and makes it easier for me to work or eat while watching tv

My husband said it‚Äôs a coffee table that transforms into the space shuttle. The pic is of step 26 of 35. So far it‚Äôs taken 3 quarters of a NFL football game, a few f bombs at the beginning, and me to give an ‚Äúspecial‚Äù gift to him later to get here. It‚Äôs definitely nicely made. He said the instructions are better and easier than IKEA so that‚Äôs good.

I‚Äôm so impressed with the packaging, contents, and instructions. I just had a knee replacement two weeks ago and was able to put this together by myself in just a couple of hours. I did save the top part for my husband to help with. The drawer slides come pre-attached so that is a huge plus! I will definitely order from this company again!

I have a couch and love seat in an L in my living room. Love them. Us them all the time. Only thing that would make it better are the bottom of the drawers and the bottom of the storage under the lifts are THIN covered chipboard. Wish the were more sturdy so I would feel better about what you can put in there.

We wanted a slightly smaller table that offered some storage, and this is that and so much more! Assembly was easy for my husband and me to do together, and it's very sturdy and looks beautiful. The lift-up table tops are wonderful for using a laptop or having a snack. And there's lots of storage between the drawers and the space underneath the table tops.

My cat loves it when I put the top up, so he can lay in the table.  Easy to build too.

Ordered this and assembled it the other day, pretty easy to assemble and seems sturdy. Ordered a rustic colored one to match the TV stand but didn't realize till just now that the one I received was dark espresso

We've had our table for about a week and we love it! The assembly was pretty simple. My husband put it together while watching football in a couple hours and with no extra yelling or cursing!We were worried the rustic brown finish would be too light, but took a chance once I saw other customer review pics and were happy to say it looks better in person than it does in the stock pics.The hinged top works best if you control it. It's not made to lift and let go. Keep your hands on it and guide it up and down and it will lift and lower beautifully.There is so much storage! Way more than our old coffee table. I still have an entire drawer that's empty which means I have license to buy more stuff.Overall we are pleased as punch with our purchase!

Sturdy and absolutely perfect. I would definitely purchase another in the future or recommend to friends.

This product was easy to put together. The directions were fantastic!  They even offered extra parts in case you need them.  The directions were clearly labeled and super easy to understand.  The product itself is great.

This table is awesome. I love all the storage the color everything about it this is the only time I've ever seen a coffee table like this and I had to have it and it's well worth it. I paid someone to put it together I didn't even attempt it but everything seems to be ABC to z.

Assembly was not that difficult, I managed without assistance in an hour or so. Love the options in design so the drawers can face toward or away from you as you choose. The tables lifting in different direction is very convenient in the placement of other furniture in the room. There is ample storage for our needs and it looks great. We really enjoy this table.

What a beautiful table, I don't think I've ever been so pleased with a piece of furniture or an Amazon sale! It's well built, the instructions are easy to follow, and it is so useful. It is one of those pieces that stands out and will last a really long time. I did need assistance with something minor (delivery issue, definitely not the seller's fault) and the seller came through for us in a big way! I am so pleased that in the future I will be looking for more pieces of furniture by this seller. Buy the table, you will be pleased both with the product and, if you end up needing help, with the seller's customer service!

This has been in my Wish List Folder FOREVA!!!  The price finally went down, so I bit the bullet & bought it along w/some VERY much needed tires!  It was SUPER easy to put together... packed VERY well & the box was soooo heavy I had to have my neighbor bring it in, BC the driver didn't knock on the door or I would'a had him bring it in.  Ya'll need to tell your driver's that when packages are this heavy, they could be a bit more courteous.  I'm a tiny "67" yo female!!!  LOL  But I love, Love, LOVE this coffee table!!!!

Love it for my grandkids. The extra places for lap tops!!

This is a nice, sturdy table.  It took me about 44 minutes to put together by myself, the instructions were pictures and easy to follow.  I liked that it included a screwdriver, so I didn't need anything extra to set this up.  While my kids aren't babies, they even included corner bumpers for those who have babies or pets.  This is a pretty cabinet and will hopefull help hide the clutter that normally sits on the table, and makes it convenient to have a snack while watching TV. We'll see how it holds up to  a couple of teens.  Definitely glad I bought it.

Table isn't small. Came packaged well, no scratches or broken pieces. The Table top is nice, you can change the direction it opens during building Table. Instructions very clear and easy to follow. Took me about an hour to assemble. Table is worth it!

I was so excited to find a thinner lift top table that opened on two sides because it's perfect for the way my couches are set up. The assembly process was long but not to complicated everything had labels and the directions were very clear and easy to follow.I like the drawers on the bottom it makes for some nice extra storage for remotes etc.

China never disappoints. It‚Äôs products are poorly designed and often defective. I needed a small table to set next to my bed to retain several items, a couple of cellphones (one, not active but used as a handheld computer, a few other items, and a tablet. This table was fairly close to the footprint I wanted, plus it had a power and charging panel. So, the functionality was there, but the Chinese incompetency emerged when I assembled it. Each of the two metal vertical sides were assembled from two pieces (for a total of four for both sides). They only go together one way, and they are identical. Each metal side had holes in it for the half dozen screws that support the two shelves and the front panel. The screws are flatheads with a slight bevel. The pre-drilled holes in the metal vertical sides were countersunk so the flathead screws settled in, leaving a flush outside surface. You will recall that I mentioned that the vertical sides were identical and assembled only one way. However, something I learned in industrial arts drafting classes in high school 60 years ago, was that the sides needed to be mirror images of each other, not identical. As a result, only half of the countersunk holes matched up to make the screws, once seated, flush. So, again, sloppy Chinese crap foisted upon the American public with the aid of Amazon. China cannot even deliver a properly designed end table. Image what all their military weapons customers are getting.

confusing instructions.  no hardware callout identifiers on assembly instructions.  Poor quality steel in hardware - allen heads sripped out with minimal force.

If this item was under twenty dollars I probably would have gave it another star since the saying goes, you get what you pay for. But since I paid $35 dollars for this, there‚Äôs no way it deserves more stars. Very cheap looking.  I got two same sides.. although the sides look the same the screw holes have indentions that suppose to be the opposite on each side, but nope mine isn‚Äôt. Would not recommend this night stand.

Teeny tiny table

Updating that at least the company offered me a full refund, for which I'm grateful. I still stand by the review though but pretty good customer service.It's terrible and not worth this money at all. They couldn't be bothered to drill holes in for the adapter. Tried to do it myself and the entire thing doesn't stay in place. I'm so mad. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I will tossing this piece of junk in the garbage and now I'm out the money and I cannot afford this. So so so so ticked off. The rest of the piece is not quality either, junk pieces.

This might have been the most frustrating piece of furniture I've ever assembled. These screws will really make you question whether you are hardware competent or not but the fact of the matter is the screws that came from the factory are simply subpar. A few of them were fine and noticeablely easier to tighten but some of them were so bad that it either took 15+ minutes to complete or I had stripped some of them due to the poor quality of the screw.I know the screws were the issue and not the operator (me) because I purchased another piece of furniture later that also had hex screws and it took me 4 minutes to assemble in comparison to the 2+ hours this nightstand did.Needless to say, check out other options until this manufacturer figures out their screw problem.

It was smaller than expected and very hard to put together. The screws were very hard to get in with the little L shape tool they give you. Took 2 hours to get one put together. The holes aren‚Äôt drilled deep enough. I had to use my drill to deepen them. All the screws got stripped out when I tried to tighten them and had to finally use a wrench to get them in which messed up the paint on the metal and further ruined the screw. I‚Äôd return them if I hadn‚Äôt wasted so much time putting them together. I bought two. Very unhappy! Hardest thing I have ever assembled. Cheap wood. Go to IKEA. At least those are way easier to put together and better materials. Directions were also horrible. You basically have to just figure it out from pictures.

The 2 set night stand was awesome until one just stopped working. The outlets do not work. I purchased these almost a year ago. Would like a refund or a replacement for the one night stand.

Assembly is easy going... Until I reached the top of the table. One of the wood anchors installed in the top piece was not threaded for the machine screw to tighten the pieces together. Thankfully I have a tap and die set so I was able to remedy this problem. Once fixed the table is great. Given this detail I give the table a 1 star because not everyone has the means of fixing this on the spot like I do. I'll update my review after a few months of owning.

The USB ports and outlets don't work on the table I received. I'm very disappointed cause that was the main selling point for me. It's useless otherwise because it's so small.

This table is NOT worth the price I paid. It is much smaller and is great for a temporary table. I would not recommend for long term use.

It‚Äôs a bitch to put together.  Not worth it.  I threw it away.

Definitely not what was listed as described. Very small and smaller than actual height of bed or sofa.

It makes no sense. Have up trying to build it and threw it I‚Äôm the skip. Life‚Äôs too short

This item looked good online but when i got it , item was way too small.

So small you can barely fit anything on top of them

To small

Product broke as husband was attempting to put it together. Of course, one week past return window.

Too damn small. Belongs in the trash

Too much assembling required with difficult Allen wrench. Holes did not line up perfectly.

The usb on one of them had already broke with in two weeks of having it. Size is great

Came with no instructions! I keep asking for instructions and no one can provide them

They are very short perfect size for a toddlers bed table but not an adult bed table or living room table

Its so small than its picture it doesn‚Äôt worth its price

Picture is deceiving it‚Äôs very small

Broke before I recorded them

Nice looking tables for the price but the head of the screws stick out on one table and the head of the screws is sharpToo bad they weren't all counter sunk

The wood is damaged and has scratches on it. Really disappointed !! The price I payed I should not have to experience these issues.

I only had these side tables for 3 days, went to use the plug ins and immediately smelt something burning üòÖ maybe I got a defective one, or these tables are straight up a fire hazard..

Ordered grey and they are a brown not a grey. The size of them are really small.

These look like they belong in a doll house. These are extremely  small. Waste of money. I would  not recommend.  Its even too small for a childs room

So small and cheaply made

I don‚Äôt like it

Both two. Corners of 3 out of 6 shelves were chipped when received.

Received something that looks nothing like the pics!! Supposed to have 3 levels bottom middle and top and we got this short little 2 level table

Not a bad end table set but it didn‚Äôt come with the 4 D screws that hold the power outlets on.

Received two right hand side.  Screws don‚Äôt countersink on one side.  Looks like crap.

Very small and the wood broke when we put the plug insert into it

A whole lot smaller than what I imagined them to be

I like it only because it has a built in plugs but it‚Äôs not very big in size and it‚Äôs not tall. Very lightweight. I‚Äôm just not a fan

The instructions are very misleading at first,  it tells you, you will need certain tools to put this together yet give you Allen wrenches to do it. Which is a bad idea,  I definitely recommend using a drill. They are super short, the pictures make them look taller than they really are. I would have returned them if I hadn't had such a horrible time putting the first one together. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because they are cute little tables.

The USB already stopped working

Don‚Äôt be fooled by the pictures.  This table is really small.  Be sure you check measurements before ordering anything. Especially this!

For what you get, six pieces of press board and a bunch of metal arms. This thing is way overpriced and unfortunately trying to send it back would cost even more money because technically there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it.

Study yet VERY small. Would send back if I hadn't already put it together

This small, fragile side table is unlike what we typically see. You get what you pay for. It may be Okay for the kid's room.

Not sturdy and very difficult to get screws in with the wrench provided.

Smallest table this is for a 2 year old. What bedside with this fit by?! Waste of $

Rather bummed with this item. They use tiny screws that have a tiny nutwrence to turn them. The end of the wrench got stripped halfway through the 1st table's assembly.  It's super hard to screw the screws in and I had to use a rag as a grip on the tiny wrench. If I had gloves I'd use them. In the end I used a pair of pliers to grip the tiny wrench to turn it. A Super pain. I've never had this hard a time assembling furniture ever in my life. Not an exaggeration.But when it's all said and done and I got them finished they are teeny tiny tables. Too small and low to use as an end table for a grown-ups bedroom. I normally put my alarm clock on the side table, but it sits so low below my bed mattress that I can't even see the numbers on the clock.. its like I need a stand to put the table on so it's high enough.These are for children's bedrooms or very very small people. Not grown adults. I'm only 5'10 & I have to bend over to reach the top to place am item on them. They should be at waist hand level to be usable & convenient.Will be getting rid of these and get adult sized furniture. They look nice but just Way Too Small to be usable by adults.

It is a little small, wish it was a bit taller and wider.

Literally the top is as big as a plate, not even. So we decided to use them for our lamps. Thats all it can hold. If they were bigger, would be much happier. Plugs work great.

Already chipping 1 month old

Look good but had to go buy baskets to cover cords in back, also seemed to get warm when I plugged in light. Price high for what I got

First and foremost:  Dont just read the measurements - understand them!  I did not do this.  I bought 2 of these to use as nightstands next to my bed.  I looked at the measurements, but didnt really comprehend the measurements.  They just "looked" nice.  These things are tiny in surface area and height.  A single sheet of paper will cover 3/4 of the surface area, so you cant put much on them.  Also, the top of these nightstands are several inches below my bed's height.  Simply put, I cannot use them as nightstands.  They are just too low and small.  The only part you can easily reach is the top.  The middle and bottom shelves are too low to actively use.The built in 6 foot power cords sound long, but they really are not.  If you want it to look nice, you have to run them down the leg to the floor, then over and up to the socket.  That reduces the length in half.Speaking of power, the 2 USB sockets are base 5V type A sockets, so no quick-charging with them.  If you need a USB C connector, then you will need an adapter.  If you need quick-charging, you can use an adapter in the 120V electric sockets.  But now you have a wall wart hanging off of the front.  Of course, mine are white, so it sticks out visually.Putting them together is pretty easy.  However, you have to be careful not to over-tighten the screws into the middle and base wood pieces, as you can strip out the hole drilled into the wood.All that being said, they look decent.  They seem fairly solid and sturdy.  I cant use them in the bedroom, but I ended using them as end tables for my couch.  They are a decent height for that.  However, I will need at least one extension cord.

It‚Äôs a great table nothing wrong with it but it is very small. I got it to be a side table for my couch ( a normal sized loveseat) and it‚Äôs just a little too short. Works great as a bedside table. Just be aware if you have a regular sized couch it will be about 2 ft too short.

A little smaller then I was thinkingThey are OkFor the price

Our nephew says it fits in the leftover space next to his bed.

Dudnt fit my filter with bucket  otherwise its fine

This is much smaller than expected and not at all sturdy. You can‚Äôt even tighten the hardware, everything just keeps turning and not getting tight. Will definitely find something else.

Charging unit screws don‚Äôt hold so unit is not secured into table.

Tables were fine for the price I paid, but every wood piece had damage to the corners.

it's small like I needed. But the poles are very cheap looking and very light. It's going in a guest bedroom and will work for short term. I would not use this in a living room.

After assembling the product I find it to be sturdy and looks great. But it is very small. It is not tall enough to use comfortably next to a bed, recliner or chair. I‚Äôm not sure when or how you would use this, except maybe with a child who needs a charging station. As an adult I have to bend over to use it. Otherwise I‚Äôm happy with the product.

Lamp.

It does what its suppose to. Its on the smaller side of what I thought it would be. The legs an support seems to be a little flimsy to me but other then that it does work well for me.

This item is SMALL. Almost tiny in comparison to a regular side table. I didn‚Äôt expect much because it is cheap, and I ordered it to prop books on but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be about 2 feet in height! Literally.

It's too small. I like it, but I wish it had been bigger.

This morning I woke up to the cables that were attached to the table we no longer working when they were connected. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed I really liked having the chargers near me now they will have to be farther away because I can‚Äôt charge from the stand

The holes to aid in assembly‚Ä¶non existent‚Ä¶so needless to say was a no go for me.. I not handy..nor do I own the tools to drill holes so this was a return same day it was received.

This was extremely easy to put together but I think for the price it‚Äôs a bit pricey, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I am poor.

But very small

Shorter than advertised but it will work. The color is great. Husband was frustrated he had to use hand tools provided not electric, the heads stripped easily

Screws were hard to fully get in, they are sticking out, turned it around. Took almost 30 mins each because the tool literally so hard to use, and stripped screws. Hoping it stays together since not all screws are fully in.

lookslike it would be hard to assemble but followed pictures and was easy, never needed drill. smaller than I expected.

Seems like a nice product however when assembling there were no holes on the side of the top to insert the screws to attach.

The product itself is not bad - looks good but the size is really small.

Very small but sturdy

Unfortunately they are way too small for a larger area. More suitable for a smaller room, apartment or child's room.

They keep falling down. A heavier frame could have worked better.

It was very small like you can only put 3 phones side by side horizontal no boundaries and things fell very often.

This table was easy to put together. Perfect for a small room and has ample ammount of charging ports and plugs. 2 shelves to store small things and a nice table top. I have it a 3 star because the Greige colour which I ordered doesn‚Äôt look like the picture shown which I would have preferred the one displayed on Amazon.

Looks cheaper than in the photo.Not as strong either, the electrical board is only fixed by two tiny screws that keep lossening.All the outlets work great, only the two standard outlets are a bit too close together so I can't have my laptop and lamp plugged in at the same time since they are both big square charger plugs.The USBs are great though.Wouldn't recommend for anything but a guest room. It's not even sturdy enough for a teens room.

Small little table, not worth more than $20

They're pretty basic, with power outlets on the back which are pretty nice.Unfortunately the package was short 1 of the foot pads for it to stand correctly on the floor so it will always wobble back and forth making the one table useless.We bought them when we moved and because of that they were not assembled right away and we have missed our return period.Update: the seller has contacted me and sent the missing piece............ Great customer service

I'm quite pleased with these end tables, considering their affordable price point. Their aesthetic appeal adds a touch of elegance to my space. While they could benefit from improved cable management, such as a built-in solution to secure power cords, I find them to be a worthwhile addition. The slight inconvenience of managing cords is overshadowed by their overall charm and functionality. All in all, these end tables offer great value and enhance the ambiance of any room.

The assembly wasn't difficult but it kinda flimsy and looks pretty cheap.

One of the end tables when assembled is not steady but shorter on one side. The other end table had a pole with no holes for screwing together the panel for the charger

Easy to assemble but I find it short and small

A lot smaller than I thought üò•

The item was not what I expectedColour of end tables was not the picture showed themThe size was smaller than i expectedThey are not what I thought they would be as night stands

They look good and sturdy but they are very small

They are a lot smaller than I expected‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but are sturdy and the plug outlets on there work good

Not the best quality but so far it‚Äôs doing what it‚Äôs supposed to. Handy to have the outlets on the stand.

Beautiful set but it was to small for my livingroom.

Screw head type is not standard, hard to assemble. But good value for money.

You get what you pay for,regret it

They were smaller than l excepted.  Guess l should have read more on the description prior to ordering.  Otherwise l love the easy access to charging my devices.

Not the best quality,

Looking for a bedside table or an accent table to fill a small space?  I was too, & found this wonderful little rustic & very reasonably priced keeper.  It holds together well once assembled & is not rickety.  Check your desired measures because it is small, but what I was looking for in a small table.  The two outlets & two USB plugs come with a well wrapped & good length extention cable.  Just a great buy.  The picture may make it appear larger but it is small.  Clear instructions & Allen wrench supplied.  I am happy with the product.

Put it together in less than 30 min. Instructions clear and easy to follow. Love it has option for usb charging (x2) or using a brick.  Very well put together and excellent buy for spare room

A small table but perfect for a small space where I just needed a place to put my phone and coffee. Took less than 15 minutes to put together. Nicely constructed

I purchased these because I am always looking for places to charge our phones, tablets, and use our laptop . These tables help to solve that problem and have shelves too. You can put a small basket and put your TV remotes, your charging cords, and other item. Below you can place your favorit books or a larger basket for bigger items. Just make sure to measure the table shelves within the metal poles that connect the shelves and serve as legs. It also comes with screw on feet that have a heavy duty plastic tip that can be adjusted to level your table if you have uneven floors. The instructions and the pieces are labels well. I put these up on my own.

This was as advertised - a small nightstand with electrical outlets. Very functional and easy to set up. It's a bit on the small side, but the stated dimensions are correct. Just know ahead of time that you can place a lamp and a book and a pair of glasses on top but not much else. Pretty sturdy, though.

Ordered this two piece set yesterday, got it delivered today. Assembled in about an hour, it is great quality for the price! Love the multiple shelves and the built in charging ports! Will be recommending to others!!

These end tables are perfect for our small guest room. We had two folks with CPAP Machines and needed smaller bedside tables for them to be comfortable.READ, READ, READ the instructions carefully! My husband put them together with the screws and tools that were provided. The only hiccup he had was he installed the USB panel backwards.Also - go ahead and turn the screws in a few turns and move on to the next to keep them all in line.Our guests said they were quite handle tables as they loved the plug ins and USB chargers. Two end tables came with our purchase and they look great.I would definitely order these again

It is the perfect size for a small end table. Sturdy and easy to put together.

We love this table! We use it in our nursery and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing to have. So far the plugins work well, there‚Äôs plenty of room. I don‚Äôt recommend using it as a regular side table unless you have a small room. It‚Äôs not big enough and may look weird next to a big bed LOL. Overall its great!

I loved that you able to charge your phone, and also the extra plug-in outlets really come in handy. I love it!

Good product. Must buy. Value for money.

It was easy to assemble and works very well built good and sturdy and material was as good as you could buy any where

Easy to assemble by one person, sturdy as of now. Would of liked to have bars around so what ever you put won't fall of.

I love the color of the wood and the sturdiness of the product. They are a bit smart than I was thinking, but the measurements are correctly. Overall would but again.

It was easy to put together

Table was smaller than expected. Otherwise it‚Äôs great

Convenient for phones, game controllers. Wireless earbuds, etc. Less clutter and tangled wires at the wall plug. Nifty shelving for more storage.

The charging unit had a crack in the front.

Overall the product is nice.  However it is so small that it doesn‚Äôt work beside a bed or any piece of furniture.  It‚Äôs less than 2 feet tall.  I failed to look closely at dimensions & reviews.  Learned a lesson.  It‚Äôll go in a corner for a charging station with a tiny lamp.

Good and easy to build.

Useful easy to assemble inexpensive.

End table

Okay for the buck

I really love that this has outlets on the side for easy access for my teenager. He even put it together himself so easy assembly! It does seem a little short, that would be the only negative thing. Very happy with this purchase!

Delivered on time and easy to assemble.

Its a little smaller than expected. Super easy to put together. I love the charging port, makes it easier to plug my phone in.

A little smaller than expected(didn‚Äôt measure my fault) but love it had outlets and great quality.

Endtable for small lamp

Nice color, very small in person,  charging connections work great . Overall these end tables were ok, but definitely tiny

This is a nice little bedside table for a teenager. Love the attached outlets, you know a teen carries so many electronics that all need to be charged at same time. So convenience is a must. We didn't give this a 5* because although it's good enough for a teens room, it needs to have weight to it in order for it to be sturdy. Overall we are satisfied.

Worked perfectly in my space. Like the electrical connection. A little difficult to put together.

Okay I should have looked at the dimensions, but damn this thing is short and the pictures make it look taller. The table is towering over the couch and chairs in the pictures and I put it by my couch and it doesn‚Äôt even come up to the arm. It‚Äôs a cute table, but definitely don‚Äôt be like me LOL!  measure!!

Easy to put together and works like a charm for all of my charging needs.

Kinda tricky to install but if you follow the instructions it can be done quickly. It‚Äôs pretty sturdy and small so if you need a side table and only have a limited amount of space this is the one for you

These are very simple to put together, and are pretty sturdy for their size. They match the coffee table we also recently purchased, and they work great. I really love the plug feature, it‚Äôs super convenient for us with our living room set up. The only reason I give 4 stars is due to price, they are very nice but I think they‚Äôre a little expensive for their size. I ordered a full size coffee table with a lift lid that‚Äôs similar in style for $50, but these tables are good quality regardless. I recommend!

Effective

This little end table is perfect, I love the ability to charge my phone or tablet. The quality is impressive considering the reasonable cost. It is very east to assemble and looks better in person.

I like the price , the color is nice and the outlet is my favorite attraction !

I like the tables, once put together, however the picture (only) instructions were vague. I put many pieces together backwards and had to take apart and re-do. Frustrating.

We put this in the kids room. It's small enough to put anywhere, yet serves its purpose very well.

Looks amazing, plugs and usb ports all worked. Sturdy, but kinda small. Overall worth it!Second ones came with dented corner from handling, product great, upset about the damage!

It was easy to assemble. Extra parts..just in case.. works just fine as Bedside table.

Perfect for a few bed side items

It‚Äôs a decent recliner side table for my dad who is visiting. Easy to build.

This was used to hold my husband‚Äôs urn. I needed a nice but strong table and the added feature of the plug made it easy to add lights to the display.

They are very sturdy and beautiful

Strong but smaller the expected. Top could be a little bigger

All required hardware was included and labeled. All parts went together without a problem. They should be fine as nightstands.

For the space I have it works very well.  Pretty easy to assemble but best to have 2 people for the first steps.  The instructions s are well designed

I like itVery nice

This is a perfect little side table for our family room. Easy to put together. The plug is convenient.

Works fine. There‚Äôs a place for the paper, and strong enough for the application I‚Äôm using it for.

I‚Äôm using these for end tables. One by my chair and one by my husband‚Äôs. I love the look and they‚Äôre sturdy.

They are super cute. I do wish they had a drawer to keep remotes in though. Love the charging capabilities.

It put together pretty easily while i was watching TV.  Looks great.  Bought it for my bubble tent to set up a projector on, haven't used any of it yet to see how awesome it's going to be.  Maybe once i'm done ill post a pic of the end project.

Easy to assemble but a little smaller than i expected

Perfect for any small to large space. Easy to assemble.

These tables are exactly what I needed for my guest room.  They are great additions because they are small and fit in right next to the two beds.  My guests can charge their phones or iPads and keep them close by.  I added a couple of small lights that clipped onto the tops of the tables.  I am very pleased with these tables.  In addition, they were not too difficult to put together.

I kept one and gave one away as gift! We are happy!

These are wonderful with all the electronics today they make the perfect side table

Exactly as pictured. Small apartment multi function.

Received this quickly. Was able to build it without issues.

It was smaller than I expected but fit well in the corners of my bedroom. Easy to assemble, and the charging unit was a plus for me.

They r so convenient and just a perfect size for use as end tables.üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è

Bought this table to put my CPAP machine on and to charge my phone at night. Also this table fits nicely next to our bed in our travel trailer. Well constructed and very sturdy!!

The perfect size for a small bed side table. Enough space for a wireless phone charger and a book plus extra space for anything else you need in the middle of the night

I like that it has a plug in and cell phone chargers

So handy by the bed for charging devices. Nice design and wood. I love it!

It just so happens that it fits the area that I have but honestly, I would‚Äôve liked something a little longer. The width was fine. And I like having two outlets and a charger close at hand.  The Little shelves are nice too.

It‚Äôs well made and easy to put together. I recommend using zip tie or Velcro strap to keep cord out of way for top shelf.

Easy to put together.  Cost effective and great looking in our furnished Airbnb apartment.

The table is quite cute and easy to assemble. The quality is also pretty decent for its price.

Table meets the demands for a chair side stand. Its electrical power plug is great.

I needed a table to put by our recliner. This is perfect. I love that I can charge my phone or whatever else I need to charge. It has two shelves and I can store my books on them and put my fan on top. It's a great table.

Cute little table. Pretty sturdy for the price. Easy to assemble.

Exactly what I needed to set beside my recliner. To be honest I should have ordered two of them to have twice the space but that would have been for convenience not necessity. It is sturdy, was easy to assemble and I can keep my remotes and a bottle of water beside me when I am watching Tv.This was an ideal purchase.

This end table is sturdy, and decently made. It has the plug ins for you phone and regular plug ins built into this. They all work.

The top shelf could have been slightly larger.

Love this little night stand

I bought 2 of these for each one of my teens and they loved it. Great look and very easy to assemble. Great product at an affordable price.

Pretty sturdy and very easy to assemble. We're a little smaller than I expected but the extra shelves make up for the smaller size.

It was easy to put together. I had my boyfriend do it to keep him busy while I did something else. It is sturdy. The charging ports work nicely and do the outlets. It's a good looking table and has taken some abuse from being in my home! None the worse for wear.

Fills my need for a printer table.

It was easy to put together!!  The heavy duty cord for the charger/outlet is long so we corded it a leg.  Very pleased with it for the price!!

Living in an old house, electrical outlets are at a premium.  And life in the modern age demands plugs and USB ports.  I don't like surge protectors with multiple plugs because, I'm either a) stubbing my toe on the on button, leaving nothing protected (including my toe) or b) stumbling around in the dark when the alarm goes off, kicking the surge protector out of the wall.  When I saw that this table had two outlets and A USB PORT, I purchased it.  It arrived in a very small, flat box which I found, at first, intimidating.  How could a table fit in this tiny box?  Assembly could not have been easier.  You have the option of a drill, a screwdriver or an enclosed Allen wrench.  We all know how to use an Allen wrench.  All like pieces were in their own numbered bags,  in the order that they were needed.  You put 1 and 2 (shelves) together first.  You use bag 3 to secure 1 to 2.  You righty-tighty the screws until they stop turning.  The outlet/USB panel is the last to go.  Total assembly time was maybe a half hour and the instructions were really helpful.  It's also very Mission-style looking, very dark wood, which I like.  It's the perfect height for charging your phone at night, for placing your alarm clock and for plugging in a lamp.  I love it and would absolutely buy another one.

Easy to put together, perfect size for small spaces.

This table is small enough to take up very little space, but big enough to serve an important task. It's sturdy and looks good.

I bought two of these end tables and I'm satisfied with them both.

They worked out perfect for our living room.

Husband can't do this anymore. I did it all!! Soo easy. I LOVE this adorable little table/ shelf.Thank you!!!!

Unfortunately I didn't look carefully enough upon purchasing and didn't realize it size. 5ft 8in and goes up to about my waist. I ended up returning it but process and everything was easy and difficult free.Fairly easy to put together. It has adjustable stoppers on bottom. So you can slightly loosen or tighten if theres uneven flooring it sits on. It also has good friction so it won't slide.All that's needed came with inside the box.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I work from home & I don‚Äôt necessarily have office space, so I have a makeshift office inside my closet lol. It fits great & makes me more comfortable in my little space! The led lights are super cool! There is a small crack in the wood but luckily it‚Äôs not deep enough to jeopardize the integrity of it & luckily is underneath & not visible on top. Great value for the price!

I didn‚Äôt have too much space in my room. I wanted a desk that doesn‚Äôt take up space but yet able to place some of my desk stuff. I love the way that I can plug the outlets onto the desk without having the plugs look messy. I also love the light feature which come in three different mood. Desk is sturdy and pretty easy to assemble

Perfect fit into the space available. Very easy to put together. Looks great, love the colors available for the lighting üëå

this is nice, its easy to assemble and looks nice with plenty of space for storage under the monitor shelves. the only drawback is that the bottom shelf is too small to store a gaming tower unit, if the shelf was extended at least on one side it could store a gaming tower under the desk.

As a person who hates to assemble anything, I will say the instructions to put this together was very straight forward. To give you an idea of who I am. I get sad if I have to do any sort of heavy duty tool related work. I have my lawn serviced to save myself the sweat.  I'm not lazy but I'm no organic gal.  Therefore when I say I was able to do this, it should give you a clue. If you follow the instructions you will be fine. As Colette from Rattoulle says "Follow the recipe." üòÖ I took a pic of this one thing you need to remove from the desk when you see it, otherwise it's going to have you pushing unnecessarily to line up the holes toward the end. TAKE IT OFF. üòèThe desk is well made, sturdy and perfect for that small space that you can still make useful.  It took me a while to put it together but I got distracted a few times but the end result is worth the effort and the price. You won't be disappointed.

UPDATE 8/3/24: Changing to 5 stars. The seller got back to me and sent me a whole new desk at no extra cost. It looks amazing!Original Review: The back corner leg just snapped right off of the main table piece with the barest hint of weight added. Maybe I got a faulty piece but it basically disintegrated around the screws. I have emailed the company but no response yet. Very disappointed, I was so excited, I even received it earlier than expected. Big let down.Update 7/2/24The support people with the company returned my email in a very timely manner, hopefully they can get me a replacement part. If things go well I intend to give 5 stars as everything else with this table seems fine and in great condition.

Easy to assemble- perfect for work from home moms. Very cute especially the white one. Holds both of my computer screens at the top shelf and has plenty of room for note pads on second shelf. Key board has its own space. Great for small spaces in a corner - out of the way.

this was perfect for my husband paint corner. Keeps everything nicely tucked in the corner.Fits my husbands paintbox her made like it was made for it.

I needed a small desk to work from home and this desk fit perfectly. The work surface is big enough for my 15" laptop and a mouse. Assembly of the desk was a breeze with the parts clearly labeled and holes pre-drilled. Some a the screws were missing labels, but comparing them with the pictures and # of screws needed, it was easy enough to figure out.The reason I only gave this 4 stars is the keyboard tray. This was quite difficult to assemble with no pre-drilled holes and the sliders have some sharp edges. I ended up with a few cuts on my fingers. And once assembled, it doesn't even work as it should. One of the sliders appears to be broken or stuck, letting me pull the tray out only half-way, effectively making it useless.

Exactly what I needed.  Sturdy and easy to put together.  Love the lights and power strip

Unfortunately, when it came time to build the desk, the parts were broken. Didn‚Äôt even take all parts out of the packaging and had to put everything back in the box.  Returning desk.

I opened the box and took everything out piece by piece looking for the assembly instructions to find out that the instructions were not with the order

I rarely write reviews, things have to be really great or really terrible....the packaging is inadequate, arrived with all polystyrene broken/damaged. I could not tell if this was a previous return and re-ship but it was in poor condition. I did start to construct but decided to stop and attempt to re-package as best I could.... as the overall quality was not good enough - if you enjoy a challenge then have fun with this....I guess you get what you pay for....

Came broken.

Had to update my review-lights and outlets stopped working after a month. I guess you get what you pay for. If you just need a decent desk this is nice but if you want it for lighting buy something more expensive.Took a bit to built but totally worth it! I‚Äôm saving a lot more space in my small office and I have more table space to write notes than before. Lights are nice when working late.

I dont have the hex tools that were supposed to come with this package.  That's fine I have my own. Turns out you need their tool to use some of the screws.Incredibly frustrating as I only have the time tonight to put this together for my kid.DO NOT BUY

The keyboard stand completely fell apart after only a few days. Clips, ball bearings, all just came apart. Wasn‚Äôt being leaned on or abused in anyway. The keyboard was on it and would get typed on. Very disappointed.

Do not buy this product if you like the look of the LED shelf if you are unlucky like me yours will come with two incorrectly cut and measured planks for the LED shelf that will not fit causing the whole look of the desk to be trash . Worst Christmas mistake I ever bought .

Really needed this desk for work and was looking forward to it. When I ooened the box it was already broken all the way thru. Cracks on other parts too but the top surface (most important part of course) was fully broken

While the product did come quickly, upon putting it together it literally broke before it could even be used. Wood most be old.

If you buy this, pray you don‚Äôt have any issues with it. I‚Äôve sent emails about a part being cracked on unboxing and needing a warranty replacement and have received no response. They are a third party so Amazon can‚Äôt help. Terrible service.

Corner of desk broke off while pulling it together.  Too cheap.

Desk broke

Discoloured paint spots, the wooden pieces were filthy and had some chunks dented. Didn‚Äôt want the hassle of returning so I just cleaned and fixed it up myself. Super disappointing for the price you pay tho. The quality would have been worth the $40 I could have paid for the same desk on market place.

This is going to be painful. Why would there be NO instructions or at least a photo of the product in the box?  I do NOT recommend this product.

This looks nice in the pictures.. it is made with the cheapest materials. All the wood (thinnest pressboard I‚Äôve ever seen) started warping as soon as there was any weight added to it. Absolute garbage!

This desk should be priced around $50. It‚Äôs not worth anything near $150. The keyboard tray doesn‚Äôt roll how it‚Äôs supposed to. It gets stuck. The rest is made out of super cheap wood. Do yourself a favour and go to an office store.

Had this table over a month now and the table is just very poor quality for the price. Yes the lights are nice to have and the shape of table is nice however the keyboard tray has already broken and will not stay no matter how many times it‚Äôs fixed. Then table has started to wobbled when in use.

So cute and love how space saving it is however barely any of the screws lined up and I have carpal tunnel so it was almost impossible to put together. As well two screws came split and stripped so I had to hammer them in, also the track for the drawer came broken but I need it for work next week

Upon observation the desk is cracked. This would be such a great desk if this wasn't factored

The desk itself is lovely, but it is missing screws and I‚Äôm unable to even build the desk :(

I was so excited about this desk all through the construction. Good size, decent materials. Then when I finally set everything up, I realized the tray for the key board is rickety and sticks constantly. Very cheap. Save your money.

this is very poor and non functional design for the top level see photos , ineeded the desk so I altered the design to work very poor design that must be revised  before any more are sold

After opening the box to assemble the desk I realized all the components were covered in fiber glass particles. My hands were severely itchy and throat was irritated. This should not be acceptable. Fiber glass is a known irritant and carcinogenic.

So I ordered this for my 10 year old and when I unwraped the packaging, I saw a stane on both sides of the table. The stanes were like grease stanes. Also when I finished building it, I saw a label that said the has KILLED CHILDREN FROM TIPPING OVER!!! I let my child use it but I'm scared! But if it was for me, it would be 5 stars all the way! It does like up and it was a perfect aesthetic to her room. Recommend for ADULTS.

The sliding drawer metal piece on the side is very sharp. My husband cut his hand on the metal while putting it together.

It is definitely not for a full time desk user! Keyboard pullout very unstable! Its ok for a the price! I expected a little better quality all around for the size!

I loved how I looked, but just  was not sturdy, had to return it, as we have a baby on the way and the thought of him crawling and pulling up on on this did not feel good.

Updated - as soon as my review was posted the seller reached out to me with an apology and offer to rectify the situation. I still think the desk is worthy of 3 stars, but the seller gets 5 stars from me.It took an entire evening (4+ hours) for me to assemble this. I‚Äôd rather assemble IKEA furniture. And it‚Äôs still not done as per instructions since I simply couldn‚Äôt get some of the screws to line up. I have an ergonomic keyboard and the tray doesn‚Äôt quite pull out enough. I really needed something with a riser for 2 monitors that would fit a small space, so this fits the bill but it‚Äôs not great.

Screw hole was off.  When the correct screw was screwed into the hole, the screw tore through the wood and is now protruding through.  The raw material of the piece is exposed.Love the desk, size is actually perfect for a small space and durability and stability is great!

Overall the desk is perfect for my sons room,  but make sure to check the shelves as mine came damaged.

Keyboard drawer won't pull out away from the desk

Arrived with the top large triangle cracked. Had to return it to the sender and when I went to reorder, this desk isn't an option anymore. Other than that one piece, the pieces look well made and are attractive. I have ordered the next size up desk from them, that will likely be even better for me.

Way too small for an adult but good for children

Pull out keyboard contraption broke immediately.

Unfortunately didn‚Äôt bring enough screws to set up, my grandson was disappointed his room was not ready yet.

Easy to assemble works as expected multi function lights are a nice touch.

This is a beautiful desks it was just what we were looking for. Very nice looking only downfall was the led light strip stooped working and a few of purchasing it.

Table is good. The plug outlet works but the usb port doesn‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt realize u until I finished assembling it. üëéüèΩ

Great product but hard to put together IMHO!!ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Good for the value...holding up

Putting together was ok, instructions were good but packaging of pieces could have been better. It was a little hard to tell parts, labeling of screws need to be a little better. No one can read a Gold letter on a pkg let‚Äôs stick with darker colors. Example I had no idea the pkg C screws were for C because I couldn‚Äôt read the gold lettering. But with finally figured it out.  All in all the desk is perfect for my corner In between my Billy Bookcases from IKEA.

Granddaughter loved it so its a hit with me. Easy to follow directions, and pleasantly surprised by the numerous light settings. Only con is "wood" feels a little thin.

Not bad for the price and it feet‚Äôs perfect in the corner. Top shelf can not be used for Apple to small.

Okay desk for the moneySlightly flimsy

Though the measurements were stated, I wish each side were a bit longer. Overall nice little corner desk

While there is no light controller app to speak of (though the manufacture says there's a QR code for it on the light instructions *what instructions???*) the overall desk is nice. I give 4 stars partly from the false advertisement and building ease (some screws needed a drill.) Would have liked warmer lighting, there's only a few color options and the LED strip takes one of your two USB ports. BUT the desk does the job.

This is a perfect fit does not take up a lot of space. I love the LED lights underneath and it is perfect for my laptop and my humidifier and my minimalistic pictures that I have up there. This is a perfect table that does not take up a lot of space it replaced my big gauge glass table. Love it.

was worried because of some reviews but honestly pretty good desk. assembly was easy just by myself. only struggled attatching the bottom piece but its cause i had no one to hold it up for me. i got it anyway though.while putting it together i was worried about the stability but once i tightened some stuff more and it was fine. over all good desk for the price. good for small spaces

I needed a desk for my apartment for my monitors (I have two) since I work from home. I will say this is perfect but it is REALLY small. Don‚Äôt expect to do or put more on this desk than you have too. But otherwise it‚Äôs perfect.I put it together by myself and had no issues. The lights underneath are pretty cool and don‚Äôt let the photos make you think you get the light that‚Äôs photo is there they are multi lights!

Easy to assemble, compact and fits perfectly.

Nice sturdy side desk, it took me about 30 minutes to assemble.

There was a corner piece damaged during transport but my husband was able to fix it. Desk looks nice. Is sturdy now that it was fixed. I would recommend this to others.

I wanted a corner desk to fit in my room that didn‚Äôt take up too much space and this desk was perfect. I would consider it as a compact corner desk. But it‚Äôs just enough for a nice spot to work. And I love the led lights. Assemble was very easy.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Is very nice and as described, the only thing I didn‚Äôt like is that the printer don‚Äôt fit in the small space in the bottom. But other than that is nice.

Loved the design, just got a few scratches.

This is a very nice desk, I was just bummed that while putting it together there was a crack in the main board for the desk, it didn't go all the way thru but it goes from top to bottom. Other than that the desk is great and I love the lights that go all around it

Was purchased for my husband, he thus far, has no complaints.

Love how spacious it is for a compact table. Wish the material was a bit stronger, nonetheless it‚Äôs great value for the price.

Lots of parts to put together but fit perfectly in my small room

This desk is very cute with it's LED lights! It's also great if you only have a small space & need a computer space! For me, it worked perfect so that I can use it for my work computer without taking up too much room since I have limited space!  It even has outlet plugs & USB plugs! You can change the LED colors to your preference! It was easy to assemble & I was able to do so alone... It took me around 35 mins to assemble it!

Desk is the perfect size for my small room and contained the essential pieces for throwing it all together, so my complaint is minor. But they failed to send me the "E" labelled black screws they were supposed to aside from the one they had in the spare bag. So when buying, make sure you have some of your own similar style screws in case they neglect to send you any.

Look pretty nice and easy to install

This is an excellent, little corner desk. The plug and USB ports are handy. The LED lights work. I wish the desktop had a ridge around the back or extended flush to the wall the same way the top tier does. There is a gap of 4 inches, with nothing to stop things from falling off.The keyboard tray is a little small to "comfortably" accommodate a full size ergonomic keyboard/number pad and mouse, but I compared it with others on the market before purchase, and all of the others' keyboard trays were the same dimension or even smaller. It's a tight fit, but it manageable. This desk was exactly what I needed precisely because it is so compact and I only had a VERY tiny corner space available for a desk, so I was pleased with the purchase, overall.

Overall, I‚Äôm quite satisfied with the quality. The materials feel sturdy and durable, which is exactly what I was looking for. However, I did encounter an issue during assembly - the keyboard shelf's ball-bearing panel broke, which was disappointing. Additionally, I chose not to attach the top shelf as it restricted space for my monitor, especially since I have a small area to work with. Despite these issues, the table serves its purpose well, and I appreciate the solid construction.

I was attaching the rear leg and the whole corner it bolted to broke off. The good outweighs the bad but to have a whole corner piece break off was a large let down. For the price it could have been made just a touch better. Love the lights and independent power supply on desk top. A few things I ran into was bolts just a bit bigger than the other ones in the pack and I had a few bolt ends come through the board it should have just tightened enough to hold the pieces but a few poked through. I'm still going to use this because sending it back would be a hard thing for me to do being nothing is close enough to me to make returns easier. A few small tweeks and it's a home run. Size is exactly what I wanted.

I‚Äôm happy with how easy it was to put together. Took my 11yr old and me 1hr to put together. As other commenters have stated the wood does split pretty easy in some spots. I find no issues with the keyboard drawer like other have.One of the pictures states that you can operate the lights VIA an app but there‚Äôs no instructions on that so not sure what app to download??? Would definitely be handier if that was possible!

This desk was fairly easy to put together. Only thing was I didn‚Äôt realize it changed colours and had light settings. I had a ‚Äòpurple‚Äô one on my list but ended up with blue cause the other one sold out. Not a huge deal because the colour changing and the settings are great! Perfect little desk for my work from home set up

I reported that the screws could not be fixed, due to the lack of built-in nuts in the table. The customer service shipped another one but the led line is still not adhesive, barely hanging onto the shelf.

Looks good ! Feels pretty solid ! I built it in about 20mins ! I like it

It's very nice just sad that it cannot be lowered.

I work from home & I don‚Äôt necessarily have office space, so I have a makeshift office inside my closet lol. It fits great & makes me more comfortable in my little space! The led lights are super cool! There is a small crack in the wood but luckily it‚Äôs not deep enough to jeopardize the integrity of it & luckily is underneath & not visible on top. Great value for the price!

Lights are great and very easy to put together

I liked and highly recommend it if you don‚Äôt have so much space. Only problem is that it didn‚Äôt fit my printer on the bottom of the table.

This is a great desk for a small corner space. It‚Äôs pretty sturdy and looks nice!Unfortunately, some of the screws were missing, so I contacted customer service. They were very quick to respond and sent me the replacement screws quickly. They also followed up to make sure the parts were received and the desk is working properly. Customer Service was A+++.

It looks so cute in the corner of my room and saves so much space! Also it fits two monitors perfectly!

Easy putting together and it looks great!

Not a bad little desk at all.  Fits well.  Very sturdy and easy to assemble.

Grandson (8) wanted a cool corner desk and picked this one.  He loves it!  So far seems to be good quality.  Fast shipping (arrived earlier than expected which is always great).  Would buy from here again.

We needed a small gaming desk for a tiny play room. This worked perfect. Easy assembly. My sons headphones are bigger so I had to use a different headphone holder.

Desk is ideal for working from home

Good product works great

Easy assembly! Nice fit and lighting is amazing.

I like how everything was exactly as described.  Easy instructions to put together.

Absolutely love my set up for my work from home desk it‚Äôs the perfect size and holds my two monitors and laptop on the shelf perfectly would highly recommend for small spaces

My desk arrived with a crack in the largest piece of the desktop. Not only did the customer service replace it timely with no additional cost to me, but it was the most pleasant customer service I have ever received and they addressed the issue that caused the problem initially. Could not praise the team enough for an astounding job. Desk was super easy to assemble and so cute! Would highly recommend this company and their products to anyone and everyone!

Exactly what we needed. Small/medium sized desk for our son. The lighting feature and USB port is great! Definitely recommend

Perfect set up

Sturdy, easy assembly, good height.  Just as described.

After doing some remodeling in dining-room, I wanted something nice for my husband to put his computer on. Wow what an improvement. It was easy to assemble and a good price. The colored lights did nothing for me. I think that would appeal to a younger age crowd from all the reviews I read. I wish you could have been able to just set it on a simple white light mode when you turn it on and off, but to have to go through ALL the possibilities EVERY time you turn it on is not going to happen! I did have to make a little modification on bottom. The triangle space below for the CPU to be placed wasn't big enough and I have a HP slim line so it's pretty compact. I got a little board and placed it over the space intended to make room and it works just fine now.

Good quality,size . Just like the description!

I love how it fits in the corner of my room. It's perfect sized honestly if you live in a smaller place. Only thing that scares me it the keyboard mount.. I don't feel its stable enough as I'm typing.. so I try not to place so much weight on it. Wish the LED was brighter but love the plug in with extra sockets.

I am very happy with the quality and stability of this product.

Such a cute desk. Got exactly what I expected. I need something small for my new remote job i recently received. My boyfriends gaming chair fits inside of it nicely. Quality is good and instructions clear. Easy to install. The desk did get a crack in the middle unfortunately but I assume it was due to tightening of the screws; must have done them too tight.

Needed a small computer desk for a small space. I thought it would look cheap but it doesn‚Äôt. It looks very nice. It feels the spot nicely.

It is a great desk very simple to put together but yet very sturdy. It took me 30 minutes to assemble it. It matches the other desk that I have and fits perfectly in the corner where I Yeah need it to be.

Good design, easy to assemble.Perfect for a small corner to work/game from

Great quality for the cost. Very pleased to have a small desk space in the bedroom. It's small but just right for my needs.

I bought this in hopes of saving space and it‚Äôs the perfect corner desk. Great value and is exactly what is shown in the add

Edited to add: they did send me new tracks out for the keyboard slide! I received them today! Updated my 1 star to a 5 star. The desk has been great up until about four or five days ago. I was working and the left side of the keyboard tray fell into my lap. I picked it up and the right side fell out.  The sliding tracks have came apart and won‚Äôt stay together anymore. Emailed them and they said they don‚Äôt sell accessories that I need to go to local hardware store to buy new tracks. It‚Äôs not that easy bc of the spacing of the brackets and stuff. All the tracks I‚Äôve found don‚Äôt have the bracket on it to attach to the bracket under the desk to hold it in place  üôÑ

I purchased this desk but I did not end up keeping it. I did not put it together nor did I even open the box to assemble it. I have nothing bad to say about it, I just found a desk that worked better for me.

This computer desk was a pain in the ass to put together, but once it‚Äôs together, it‚Äôs a beautiful piece of furniture

Kinda hard to put together but not impossible . Fits all my needs. Compact but very convenient! Great value for what you get

Easy to assemble. Used a power tool to go faster and very nice looking.

Once I finally got it put together it came out perfect! My son loves it. The lights are a really cool touch and it‚Äôs perfect in the corner for his small room.

I had a very specific wishlist when shopping for a computer desk.  I didn't want it to be bulky, or take up alot of space, but wanted the maximum amount of desk space to use.  I also wanted a shelf for my monitors and keyboard tray.  When I found this desk, it actually had more features than I was looking for - the plugs on the desk, extra shelf on the bottom, and snazzy led lights under the shelf.  I was realistic about the quality of the piece considering the price, so just know this isn't the kind of desk you can stand on to hang pictures.  It's very lightweight, but feels pretty sturdy for what it is.  One minor complaint is that the keyboard tray is a little too well oiled, and seems to be sliding in and out as I type.  I'm hoping that wears after time and gets a little less slick.  Other than that, this is a very nice little desk, which was relatively easy to assemble.

This desk was very easy for me to put together; I felt like the instructions were very clear. It came with all the tools needed to put it together, as well as some extra parts just in case. It comes with some stuff to secure it to the wall to prevent tipping, however I'm not worried about that so I didn't use it.The lights are very pretty. I like the color variety, as well as the different light settings (single color, flashing through the colors, and fading between the colors). It fits my gaming laptop perfectly, with room for a mouse. The shelf is a really nice depth - it fits books, my pen storage, and my desk organizer. I haven't use it a whole lot yet, but so far it's been really nice.

It was very easy to put together! üòä

Sturdy and cute

Son digs it

DO NOT BUT THIS TABLE. The hinges are horrible and it feels like it‚Äôs going to break or throw everything off the table when you go to lift it up.The height is comfortable but that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre going to lift it without destroying it. When it folds it is just as bad unless you grab it perfectly from both sides and the weight is evenly distributed. It‚Äôs too much trouble just for a coffee table.I want to return it but it‚Äôs too much trouble to take apart so I‚Äôll just throw it away. Save yourself the trouble and just don‚Äôt buy it.Plus it was damaged when I got it which is annoying. The packaging was fine so they knew it was damaged when they packaged it.

I opened this product intent on putting it together. I got through every single piece until I finally got to the last piece (pictured) which happens to be the first piece in step 1 of the assembly instructions. Upon finding this piece broken I reached out to customer service hoping that I could get a replacement piece as I still wanted this coffee table. Customer service informed me the only option was "replacement for refund" but, I'd have to somehow repackage the table for UPS pickup or delivery. I explained this wasn't possible because a) its a table! and b) the box had to be dismantled to get all the peices out. Shenerrica (Customer service rep) informed me it'd have to be packaged for UPS but reassured me it could be any box.... In disbelief I asked if there was no way possible to get this single piece replaced. Shenerrica let me know this wasn't possible because the product is out of stock... so when this person told me it could be replaced, that was inaccurate. Based on this customer service experience alone I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing.

Table went together fairly easily.Instructions were clear and no pieces were missing.The coating/paint that is on it chipped off around some of the areas where the screws went it - no the screws weren't overly tightened, the coating began to chip off around the holes during the first few turns of the screws.The tables lift-top arms for the main tabletop seem VERY FLIMSY.Unless you are holding the table top on both outer sides to lift it, only one side of the table will lift up. I honestly thought that it was going to break after only opening and closing the top once or twice.I bought this table to replace another lift-top style table that I had owned for 9 years. With that table I could grab any spot on the table top and lift it up one handed with ease without risk or worry of breaking the table.Considering I bought this table because of the lift top feature, I am very disappointed - I am starting to strongly doubt the weight capacity that the ad claims that it has.For $258 on sale I would expect MUCH better quality.I am strongly considering sending it back for a refund, but I've never had to return furniture through Amazon and am not sure how difficult the seller will make the process..I think I would have been better off just keeping my old coffee table instead of purchasing this one.

The top piece that everyone sees is all scratched on the whole top unless i open it up .. the bottom piece below is even more damaged with deeper scratches .. it looks like i have had it for years but I just put it together last nite .. its well wrapped when we opened the box but already damaged when it was shipped .. i now have to unassemble it and sand it and restain it as it looks aweful

The hours it took to assemble and the bolts are so hard to remove so when I made a mistake I can't fix it I don't recommend this table

This is so cheap, don‚Äôt waste your money. Not worth the $200. The panels are coming of legs!

Table has dent on corner.

Wrong color

This table has been a pain in the ass to put together.  For the price I guess you get what you pay for. The dowel holes are too big and the dowels are too long which caused the outer laminate to crack.  I would probably not recommend.  But we are still putting it together and maybe I will change my mind afterwards.

Top came warped, lifting on the edged about a quarter inch as you can see in the photo. It also doesn‚Äôt lay flush with the rest of the table - surprised no one else has mentioned this in their review.2 stars for being affordable, and do appreciate the storage and lifted table option. That said, I‚Äôd recommend passing on this and finding something a bit better made.

Could be better structured and it‚Äôs not sturdy at all. Every time I lift or try to put down the piece that comes out ( literally the only reason I bought it) it‚Äôs shaky and I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll break and it‚Äôs hard to put back down without the same issue. I also had to turn it around backwards for it to be functional.****Pick another coffee table. **** I gave it 2 stars because 1. I was trying to find something like this and 2. It‚Äôs at least a pretty table even though everything is not what it seems..

After a little over a month of using this coffee table, I do regret choosing this one.It looks pretty good, matches the aesthetic of my living room. But the materials are not at all worth the current price. I would, for this price, had expected better stability and a more premium feel. I would definitely say to just go to Ikea if you are okay with this level of design and feeling product.

This table is extremely hard to lift by yourself. In the corners, due to the fact that they're not round are very sharp. It was a bad purchase I made

Gas lift mechanism not working.On the video attached - gaslift does not keep large tabletop. It falls with a thud.The lift of small tabletop works fine. The tabletop goes down smoothly.

Amazon never helps you out with these, but I went to Rolanstar. In spite of the package insert that says they will happily send you a part, they won‚Äôt. I was told they didn‚Äôt have the part, and logistics would not let them ship it anyway due to its size. I find that claim dubious at best they did offer a new table in a different color which I declined, but they finally refunded me money in full and did so quickly

Becareful when you install

I have bought many of this companies products and this was the first time that I was disappointed with the quality, one of the drawers wasn‚Äôt cut properly and it had to be forced together and not it‚Äôs useless because it binds and won‚Äôt open. Not going to send back due to the pain in the ass to take it all apart

The wood damaged on edges. The hinges are not great, they don't lift evenly and feel like they are going to break when you lift them. The drawers open out on the opposite side of the lift top rather than facing towards the couch where I want them.

Just get one that‚Äôs real wood

I will dismantle it and return it, because of the bad labeling and instructions. It is not very stable and lose gas spring on the left side when you open the table top side it‚Äôs unbalanced

This is appropriate for a game room or casual den.In fact next to our new sofas it looks a bit cheap.  Materials are solid, instructions are fairly straightforward; however two of the numbered parts were mislabeled.Do your self a favor and make sure you layout and inventory all parts.  The correct parts were included, just mislabeled as another part.  I figured it out.Now the hard part is finding end tables to match, the same manufacturer's end tables are not the same color gray.  Ordered and returned

The parts of many pieces were damaged. I am quite disappointed. Just attaching one photo to show what I talking about but these kind of cracks, chips and scrapes were there in 4-5 pieces. Little upsetting for this fine piece of table. Only good thing about it is easy to follow instruction and assemble

One of the large pieces for the top has two ruffed up edges, doesn't  lay flat and had sticky residue on it. I dont know how a roughed up piece got in a new box but my son had already built 99% of the table so there was nothing I could do about it...very odd and sad.

Arrived with a crack in the wood of a larger piece. Took a few hours to construct. Cheaply made but what do you expect from China

This table has been a life-saver in my small place. It was fairly easy to assemble and works for my needs, but I live in a small NYC apartment. The material is ok, but it's already starting to "bow" in places. Otherwise, it's ok. I just ordered wheels to add to the bottom of this, so I can more easily move it around when guest come over.

I thought I would like this more.  It's ok, but it looks a bit cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not buy it again.  I spent a long time looking at tables for my living room, I made the wrong choice.  By the time I realized, it was already put together, lol  Oh well.  I'll eventually replace it, it's just ok for now.

Like it‚Äôs versatility.  Assembly was very difficult partly because of terrible instructions. Fit and finish is ok. It‚Äôs not fine woodworking, but it‚Äôs about the same as similar particle board furniture. Pretty sturdy and solid feeling.

Cheap material.Easily marked up and chipped even in day one.But it‚Äôll do for now.

Not as nice as I had imagined. But works well as a living room LEGO table.

this table looked very impressive in the pictures but when you see it in person is just not right. the colors look very old school. it took me about 2 hours to put together. after it was built it felt cheap. quality is not there, it's made out of pressed dust(Ikea type). when putting it together you have to be very careful not to screw the nuts too tight as it will make a hole in the wood. I think this is a skip, there are better choices out there.

The bottom of the drawers and inner section are very thin flimsy material which is unfortunate.This was a process to build because there are so many pieces.I love the table but with it lowered more smoothly, it's wobbly as it lowers.I also wish the hinges of the table were inset better into the table top to be less noticeable.Overall pretty good, but will take a while.

This is the second of these tables I have bought, and while the first one was grey and worth 5 stars, the rustic one is not the same quality. In the process of putting the table together it got scratches in multiple places. I was even being careful but it still happened. I'd be surprised to get more than a year out of it.

Absolutely love this table! However.. it is ruined! While putting together, 2 different places the dowel came through the top(as seen in pictures) now I have a damaged $300 table I'm stuck with. Would definitely return if it wouldn't be such a hassle. Heed my warning be very careful putting together. Wish I could get some sort of compensation/rebate.

This is a really nice, cleverly designed coffee table.  The fold out table is quite handy for small apartments or houses.It was fairly easy to put together by myself.  It took about 2 and a half hours.  The only thing that really gave me pause was the thin board that goes on the inside area where the storage is located and the in the bottoms of the drawers.  The board is not very thick or sturdy and won't hold anything super heavy.  I wish they would make those pieces twice as thick.  Also, the boards are not square but slightly rectangular so it does make a difference which way you slide them into the slots.  Measure before putting them in or they will fit loose if put in the wrong way.  This is not mentioned in the instructions.One trick for those who will be assembling this by themselves when you go to attach the large table.  Start with putting the desk part on first, then attach the hinges that go on the large table to the bottom part of the coffee table base first rather than attaching them to the table itself as the instructions say.  That way you can set the large table on top with the desk supporting it then go underneath and connect the hinges to the table.  If you assemble it the way it says in the instructions, you will need someone to hold the table for you while you screw the hinges into the coffee table base.  This reversed method made it super simple to install the top table.All in all, I think it's a great table and will hold up ok if treated gently.  It's not a long term solution but for someone starting out or that has a small space, it's almost perfect.  It's compact and has a neutral design that fits into most decors.

Took about 1hr and 45 mins to put together, definitely don‚Äôt do it by yourself it would be impossible. The bottoms of the drawers and the bottom of the storage area feel terribly thin/ flimsy so I‚Äôm definitely going to reinforce those somehow. It looks nice and the brackets feel sturdy so I hope this will last a good while, just really worried those bottom pieces won‚Äôt hold much by themselves.

This really is an impressive piece of furniture for a self-assembly item! Of course, the wood (it is MDF, no surprise there) is not the best wood, but it gets the job done. The assembly instructions were very clear. Total assembly took me 2ish hours as I multitasked talking on the phone with my best friend. Putting the lift piece on is difficult to do alone but is definitely possible (For your reference, I do consider myself to be mechanically inclined and am a hobbyist woodworker. I currently am a student away from home, or else I would have built a coffee table myself).One small complaint I have is that the drawers open in the opposite direction in which the table lifts. I assume that someone would want the table to lift toward them while they sit on the couch and also to be able to open drawers at will (such as for stored TV remotes). That is not what the designers od this table assumed, though.I did personally decide to put wood (titebond type II) glue in with each dowel (just wooden dowel pieces, not the special screw pieces). Pour wood glue in a dispoable cup and use toothpick for glue application into dowel holes. You may need something to softly tap the dowels to ensure that it goes all the way in. I have found that it really helps to do that, but it does add an extra 20-30 minutes to assembly.

Well made. Works fine. Very convenient as a table and desk if needed

Great table-just takes a few to get it together. A little less stable than I would have liked, but overall a decent table for light use.

Took quite some time to assemble but the finished product looks good.

First and foremost the table is beautiful. Love the gray with the exposed wood grain. The way it folds is really dope.Now people are legit lying when the say the instructions are confusing. You don't even need to read to understand these instructions. The illustrations are self explanatory. Only takes a Phillips head screwdriver which they provide. It's not difficult to put together. I did it by myself in a hr. Even stopping to mess with my teen daughter. That's what dads do üòÜ.  But it's a great table. Can't wait for Game night.Only take away I have is that the draws opens up the opposite side of the table that lifts towards you. So if you're sitting on the couch and the table comes towards you the draws on the other side of the table. So 4 stars for that. Wouldn't been a 5.

It‚Äôs a great table! But only one side has great support when big table is open. Handles to drawers umm one didn‚Äôt go on right straight out the box it was loose, but over all we love the table. We love that it can become smaller when not in need of the big table. Easy to open and close.

This coffee table has really cool features; storage space and converts to a table. Not as sturdy as I'd like, but it wasn't too expensive. Good value for the money.

Was worried when the beat up box arrived as to the condition of the table, but it was packed incredibly well and didn't have a single scratch. The tabletop was a pain to get on thanks to having to build it solo, but used a tv tray to assist. Other than that, very easy build with excellent directions. The only reason I don't have it at 5 stars is that I really wish the drawer bottoms and storage bottoms were as thick as the rest of it to provide more stability. Great otherwise.

We like it. The lift hinge mechanism doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence that it will be durable. We just use it carefully. Also I would like it if the drawers opened on the same side as the lift top. Could probably figure out how to reconfigure that but at this point will keep as is.

The table is ok. It does what its supposed to. It looks nice.  I knew what I was getting when I was buying it. Well packaged and the instructions are very detailed. It took me a couple of hours to put it together. You do need another person to hold the table top when screwing it onto the base.My issues with this table is it is cheap or hollow feeling. It is partical board. As you screw in screws some of the lament starts to flake off. I don't know how long it will last.I'm tired of fake furniture. But unfortunately these companies seem to be the only ones making tables with all the features this one has.Side note. With everyone worried about the environment and sustainability how they make furniture for people that "have to" change the look of their home every so many years. So they make furniture to only last so many years. Meanwhile in many years past furniture was made to last beyond the original owners. People didn't change what their homes looked like. If it works don't fix it. That's why old estates still have the same furniture in them hundreds of years later. It was just past down to the next generation to live there.Now you have stores that are built solely to sell cheap furniture that will be thrown away but they claim they care about the environment.Im not a tree hugger but I would love furniture that is built to last.And if I could find it with these same features I would buy it.Ok rant over.

It was time consuming (3 hours) to assemble.  It only had pictures, no written instructions.  However, the end product is great.

I love this coffee table. The materials are a bit cheap, but it holds up and functions as needed. I put it together in about 1.5 hours with minimal help. You will NOT be able to attach the top without help. Also, the bottom inside the table is fairly weak and won't hold a lot of weight, but it's good for extra papers, controllers, or other miscellaneous items you'd rather keep hidden away.The top opens into a full size table which we like to use when we have company. There are 2 drawers at the bottom that are great to contain the normal tabletop clutter. It also has a full length shelf in the middle where we have decorative baskets full of more items we like to keep in easy reach.Over all, I'd definitely purchase this table again.

This has to be my favorite living room item I have bought so far. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 the top piece above the drawers came in slightly damaged. I am going to fix it myself. Love how this opens into table. Very well made.

Was easy to put together I put it together myself. Did need help with the last step putting the top on. It does shut end quickly when it‚Äôs mostly down . I‚Äôm not sure if that can be adjusted. I‚Äôm using it to hid my diamond paintings.

This is a high quality table that's perfect for our family room where we oftentimes eat while watching TV.  It has the ability to double the table space by folding open after being lifted.  It was easy to put together by myself, though it was a little tricky towards then end to lift and screw the table top in place - had to contort a little.  The only small downside that I'm sure we'll get used to in time is when you lift or drop the table top, the hydraulic lifting mechanisms are independent of each other, so they lift separately; this means the table top is a little wonky when lifting or dropping.  Not a big deal, but don't have a full glass of water on table while doing it!

It turned out to be just what I needed to operate a keyboard and mouse in the living room comfortably.  However, I docked a star because I don't understand the design to have the drawers open from the opposite side, rather than the side I'm sitting in.  In order to make it work, I use the whole thing backwards, with the drawers facing me.  When I need a desk for my keyboard, I open up the top all the way into dining table mode.  It still works, but it would be better if the half table mode can be facing my side, while having the drawers also facing my side.

It was heavier and the main frame is sturdier than expected. Which was good. The riser feels a tiny bit flimsy though once you lift it up. Not too flimsy though to where I felt like returning it. One downside is the assembly. I'm pretty quick at assembling furniture and this took me about 4 hours. Instructions were decently clear. One last thing to note is they don't supply enough glue for the little wooden nub connector pieces. I had to go to the store and buy extra wood glue. I've only had it for a few days now, but I'd guess that I'd recommend this to people. It's not bad but its also not great. Also its a little taller than I'd like. I measured how it would be before I bought, but wish now I went with something shorter. That's on me though.

Super impressed with this table. It had some of the best instructions I‚Äôve dealt with and it even comes with a free screwdriver. Great quality and transforms smoothly. Had to deal with customer service and they were tops as well. Highly recommend.

For this money good enough

this is a really nice coffee table for the money, however i do wish the lifts on the table were a little stronger. it really wobbles when you lift the table. other wise i love it!!

Why I gave it for stores I would‚Äôve given at five, but there was a slight damage in one of the pieces, it was still workable and unnoticeable when put together and it was set up. It does take a little patience to put together but all in all it is perfect and I recommend this table.

The reason it‚Äôs a 4 is because putting it together takes a long time. Too long in my opinion although I understand with all the hydraulics there are a lot of pieces.Other than that it works great and I love the storage capacity

Using this lift top table in the den of our little lake house. Directions were good, pre-drilled holes were accurate. I put it together myself in about 3 hours. This particle board table meets our needs perfectly.Not solid wood by any means, but it‚Äôs priced fairly.

There is some flimsiness to it especially when extending and lowering.  Otherwise it works great.  My kids and I have plenty of room to play games and have dinner.

Everything you need in one tableTop is not solid wood as described in the writeup

I love the table, it works great. But color is more of a vehicle cherry than an espresso.

I was hesitant to order given some poor reviews BUT I am delighted!!!  Easy to assemble and looks great.  Check out the size.  It is smallish but perfect for me.  It‚Äôs more beige than grey. I would have given 5 stars if it was MDF instead of particle board. For the price it is very good value.

Great coffee table! Definitely an IKEA assembly tho! I'd use wood glue, and be careful not to over tighten things.If I had one complaint, it would be that I wished the drawers we're on the other side, so as the table top lifted, you could use it as a desk without having to have it fully unfolded.Great as a hosting slash dinner table to sit around as well.

With a few tweaks this table can be perfect.1. The book picture for the 3 and 4 legs aren't properly represented.(minor)2. The foams in the book says 5-10mm.. that a 1/2 to 1 cm... but if you see where the table is landing.. then you wouldn't put it exactly at that measurement. The best thing you could do, is actually not put those on till the table is done. Then place the foams on top of the 4 corners, with the sticky side facing up, and then, gently lower the table onto it.3. The plastic bottom is good for carpets but not on hardwood. Please include those floor protectors in future sales. Maybe even advertise it.4. The sliding boards could be thicker(my suggestion) OR the grooves could be thinner. When moving certain pieces, those sliding boards can slide right out very easily. This is because there is much play in the grooves when the boards are thin.Other than that, great table. Came with spare parts, all the items worked with the nice screwdriver provided. Please, be careful where you place all the pieces. I would suggest putting a big blanket or carpet and place all the pieces separately, neatly laid out. The pieces are easy to scratch, and dropping one of the sliders can damage them easily.The table (bigger part#1) is a bit flimsy when moving it out and in depending where you place your hand. This can be solved by having another support bar that connects the 2 sides together.I hope that these little improvements can be implemented as I would gladly buy and advertise this product to anyone.

We use this table 24/7 and I love the extension feature. It has so much storage and the fact that it can fold into a larger table was ideal for my small apartment. I wanted to be able to have people over, despite the small space. This table gave me that option, and I love it! Four stars only because I keep a lot of stuff on the table, so it‚Äôs a bit of a pain to have to move it just to open the table completely, but that‚Äôs just a minor inconvenience.

It looks nice and functions fairly nicely.The top is very wobbly to open despite following instructions and tightening properly, without stripping.I worry about having a child or new adult opening it if they are not extra careful and taught how to.

I order this table last week. It come on time and well packaged. Took me 1 and 1/2 hours to set it up. Nice design and functional. If they  made 2 packet to support the top table more stronger then this table is perfect. It quite unstable when top table move up and down. You have very gentle  with 2 hand to low the top down slowly atherwise it will slam dow like the car hood. For the price this is number 1 choise. Happy with this purchase

I love this coffee table it was easy to put together and it came with extra screws. The only thing I would say is when I pull it up and putting  the table top it down the hydralics brackets in the table are wobbly and not that sturdy. I wish they would have put sturdier bracket with it but that being said it is a nice table.

Exactly what I wanted.  Sturdy construction and not too bad to put together

Works for us great! Easy to put together for the most part. Stable and does it's job

To make this table really work for us, I'm going to have to add some support brackets on hinges so I can open out the table while it's in its lower position. It seems to sag a bit, too. It's not totally flat when it's up and open, so there's a slight peak in the middle. Not a dealbreaker since it's pretty subtle, but it's there. It should still work for puzzles that way, but as I said, I will likely have to modify it since it's a little too tall for comfort. Eating off it is a little awkward.

We replaced our coffee table with this one to give myself and husband a place to use our gaming laptops together, and also have a quick place to hide them away when not in use.It works great, but there are a few things we'd improve: it's a very small table when it's closed up, so it looks a little out of place. The top could pull out more so you can sit back on a couch more comfortably. And lastly, it is awkward to put things inside as you pretty much have to reach under the top to do so.Minor issues, just preference.

It‚Äôs a nice table and very versatile.  Wish the table glided a bit smoother but overall I‚Äôm happy with the purchase

Turned out exactly how I had hoped. Definitely recommend. And we a super easy to put together. Only needed a helping hand once.

The product looks great once assembled but remember it's pressed wood and can break and wear easily.

It arrived within 48 hours and took a little less than 2 hours to put together. Everything pieced together well, and the functionality is fantastic. Serves as a coffee table by day and a gaming table by night. Sometimes an office space in the afternoon.

i love it a lot !! the size and unfolded size are perfect. the only reason i‚Äôm giving 4 stars is just because the inside mechanisms are a little tight. i have to brace my foot on the side in order to lift the table or else the whole table will slide. so very minimal leo some but something to just point out

For the price and what it offeres it works great. My child was found laying on top of the table when it was fully out and did not break. Assembly was easy and easy to understand. One thing I will caution on is that the meterial will be prone to chips on edges later but that's with any of the furniture off amazon. Still great though and would recommend.

I received this table quicker than the delivery estimate by 4 days. Please be aware that the package is very heavy, but for good reason! The table is very good quality. I also purchased an ikea tv stand around the same time, so I can note that the building process is very similar. The quality was also similar to that of ikea, but I am sure I would've spent more at ikea, plus I would've had to pay for shipping. The table functions exactly as described, and the mechanisms seem sturdy. My friend has a similar table to this, and while I am not sure of the brand she has, her table has lasted her many years. I can suspect this table will bring me joy for many years. The instructions were easy and very detailed. There were no missing pieces or parts, and in fact, they provide an extra bag of parts just in case. There was damage to the shipping box but the table was completely unscathed. There were no dents, chips, dings whatsoever. All of the holes lined up perfectly and the table took about an hour to put together. The only notes I'd like to make are that it is very heavy, so please take this into consideration when buying. I was able to lift and build this all on my own, but it would have been much easier with help.

This is an amazing piece for small spaces!  It's a coffee table, a desk, and a meal table.  The storage is great, and it's pretty sturdy.  The assembly instructions are the easiest I've ever seen.  While easy to put together, it was a bit challenging putting on the top/small desk with just one person.  If I hadn't had a table low enough to hold up the big table while I screwed it in, I would not have been able to do it by myself.  Other than that, I highly recommend!

This piece was exactly what we needed for the storage and the function.  Color is great looks like a more expensive piece of furniture amazing price for the product. Recommend putting the brackets into the base first then attach the top versus the opposite which is how the instructions say. But overall not bad at all to put together.  Highly recommend.

Clear instructions.  Seems sturdy.  Would have been easier to build with two people not too hard to build by youself.  Nice color.  Well made pre-fab furniture.  Probably shouldn't put anything too heavy in the drawers, they are not real thick on the bottom, but expected that in pre-fab furniture.  Arrived quickly.

Updated: The customer service was great on getting a solution back to me. Update from 3 to 5 stars for excellent customer service.Original: It's a good piece of furniture except a little scratches here and there like pictured. There is a space in between where the table folds when the table is opened up but won't be an issue if you put a table cloth over it when guests are over. The table itself seems sturdy. The drawers a little wobbly when opening and closing. The table will serve its purpose, but I don't know if I would pay over $200 for it again. The delivery box came beat up but there were enough foam/protection that prevent damage to the furniture. The instruction manual was easy to follow and it came with a screw driver. One person can assemble this, but I got help when screwing the table top onto the base of the table.

More sturdy and functional then expected,  not complicated to put together but you definitely need an extra set of hands if you don't want to struggle through the assembly process

My personality loves puzzles so putting this together was a joy for me. Big fan of Ikea furniture so I have tons of experience over my GenZ years doing this.  I was a bit intimidated at first buy it was a breeze and needed no help.The whole family was impressed with this piece of Amazon furniture. Bought it to serve as a puzzle table & game table in our family room.My oldest loved it so much he is buying it from me for his apartment so I can get something smaller for the space. üòÜ I'm not charging him for assembly because I enjoyed the process so much.The only things I would encourage is a felt topper for gaming due to lint, hand prints, and sliding.I actually ordered wheels for it so I could spin it around and give it a bit more leg clearance (they are not in yet).Over all its an impressive coffee table.Doesn't look cheap and seems very solid.Highly recommend!!

I was concerned about this coffee table, as it seemed overly gimmicky and it seemed like several brands were offering something that was almost an exact copy of each other (same company with multiple brand names?). But it seems to be decently sturdy and well designed. I wanted something that I could use as a standard coffee table, but then could be expanded for a cheese/garlic/fruit/movie night with the family, or used as a puzzle table for slightly larger puzzles. So far it's done the job very nicely, and my kids think it's really cool when it's opened up. I would recommend it. There are only two downsides I can think of so far: If the kids open it wrong without raising the smaller table first, it could be damaged. There are warnings that come with it about no using it this way, but someone with kids who just throw it open could definitely find themselves with a damaged hinge. The other thing is that the corners are sharp. That's pretty common with coffee tables, so I'm not dinging this company on this. But we are talking about a low table in the middle of a few couches with people running in and sitting down in relative darkness to watch a movie. Rounded edges make sense here. I actually sanded down and repainted the edges on the last coffee table I had, but I'll leave this one alone for now as my slightly older kids (at this point) have not had issues thus far.Long and short of it though is that I do recommend it.

During assembly, one component was missing from one part of the table. Worked with vendor, who was polite, patient, and understanding of my concerns. A satisfactory resolution to the issue and a very nice, working, decently crafted table for my family to enjoy for years to come. Thank you.

The assembly took a long time (as it obviously would), but directions were pretty clear. I did the whole thing alone (I'm 5'3" and not particularly strong) and it was doable. The only part that was hard were the steps near the end where the top had to be held up while the lift top hinges were screwed in.One thing I would suggest is wait to put on the sticky corners until the end. I wish I had not done it when they told me to do it as it doesn't line up exactly with where the life top corners settle onto the frame. If I had done that part later, I could have made it exact.As for results, it's a great table for a small space. It does what it is supposed to do, and the lift top is great. I haven't used the full dining table with weight yet, but it appears to be something that will work!

I don't write reviews often, or ever, but this thing is amazing! Sturdy and stylish for sure. So glad I purchased it!

I have this coffee table in my living room and use it for doing puzzles, diamond art and other crafts. I love the extra storage for supplies. I showed to my sister and she went home and ordered one also.

Great product, easy assembly

I got this for my daughters small apartment since there is no dining area and it gives her a little extra storage space.  All of the holes lined up, and all parts were well labeled.  The instructions were very easy to follow.  I am 68 and put it together by myself. Good quality and she is so happy with it. I would definitely buy again.

Better than expected actually. Good table, pretty sturdy. Was fairly easy to assemble but need help of 2nd person for some parts (attaching the closing mechanism to top lid).

Bought this for new apartment.  Loved the optional use it provided (coffee table, dining table, laptop table), plus the storage features it provided. The design has been thought out and the cost was acceptable for the time frame I was needing it. Downfall, when received it was slightly damaged and when my dad helped put the table together, it appeared to have been previously assembled (so maybe a returned item that was then sent to me). They may need better quality control when things are returned to verify if any damage was done. Regardless, we did get it assembled and despite the little damage, were pleased enough to keep it.

This coffee table has been one of our best purchases. Well worth the money. Easy to assemble. What we like the best it opens up to a low table for four. We didn‚Äôt have the room for a standard table. This more than serves the purpose. I highly recommend this coffee table.

Love that you can use it as a table or work space. Storage area and ease of lifting  to table

Great look, very easy to assemble with excellent instructions and fit up.

So far the table performs as expected.  Quality hinges, flexible design, and hardware.  Will give it another 6 months for a break in period.

I recently got a U-shaped couch and was looking for a table that more than 2 people could use as a table. This fits perfectly in the space and i love the feature of opening this as a square for more people to enjoy.  It took me and my husband about 75 minutes to assemble, I would strongly recommend 2 people and a drill as the top piece is heavy. This feels like a sturdy piece of furniture.  My only 2 personal gripes: 1. The drawers are on the opposite side from the couch, it would be nice if they were easy to access while sitting there; 2. The is NOT espresso but a dark brown.  Otherwise, I'm really happy with my purchase and feel like it will hold up for a while.

Easy to assemble but takes a bit of time.Sturdy and functional.

The instructions were easy to understand.It‚Äôs easy to open the top up and down. Very sturdy when it‚Äôs open. I‚Äôm very impressed.

I am so excited that I have a coffee table. That is also a desk that is also a TV tray that is also a table that seats four. If you have a smaller, this is an incredible addition. I have to be honest this took a long time and two people to put together, and well worth the time and effort.

Always a little nervous ordering assemble yourself furniture. This table and package was unblemished.  It is pretty heavy and I felt sorry for the Delivery Guy who carried it up 25 stairs!Give yourself space to assemble the table.  The packing was amazingly thorough and protected everything very well.  All of the pieces and hardware are clearly labeled, including arrows to make sure the assembly goes smoothly.  I managed the assembly myself, but you might want a helper.  Attaching the main top was a little challenging, but would have been easy with help.  I liked that each type of hardware was distinct from the rest, so no way to use the wrong screw here or there.  They even included a screwdriver that was actually pretty nice.  It was the only tool you'd need and didn't strip and of the screws.So much for that aspect.Once all put together, everything works as advertised.  The surfaces look like real wood.  I got the gray color and it looks good.  They have little stickers to cover up some of the hardware.  I didn't bother with them as none of it shows in regular use.  The mechanisms work very easily and are steady when the top is up or down.The only note I will mention is a little taller as a coffee table than I imagined, but that's my fault, it is accurate in the descriptions.  I looked forward to raising the top to eat or work on my laptop.  When in the up position, it is also a little too high.  It kind of feels like you're a kid sitting at the grown-ups table.  So far, I've been using it in the down position.It is a good height for working on art projects standing up or sitting on a chair instead of the sofa.

I was hesitant to get a flat pack table with so many moving parts, but the reviews said the instructions were helpful and the table was easy to put together and I trusted them. The reviews were right. The only hard part was attaching the tabletop to the base, which should have a second person to hold the top. As I lack that particular amenity and the dogs weren't tall enough, I piled books on a chair to the needed height, and was able to complete the task. I'm really happy with it. Part of why it goes together well, is that the manufacturers thought carefully about the project. Holes are carefully pre-drilled, the persnickety things like the runners for the drawers are already attached, all the parts are clearly numbered.

Love tableEasy to put togetherGreat storage

The table is particle board so the reality is this table could be in pieces at the end of two years. However, for the price the table was easy to put together and looks nice. The bottoms of the drawers and storage areas are not strong for anything of great weight to be stored but board games fit perfect.

Was super easy to put together, about 25 minutes between me and my boyfriend. It looks super cute and works great for a dining/coffee table. I would definitely buy it again.

Need a helping hand to put the top lid on but was easy for the most part. Looks great and wonderful for playing card games.  They sent plenty of extra  screws and the instructions were clear and easy to read.

It works great for us. Use it on a daily. We have a lot of people over and it‚Äôs been great to open that up for guests to eat or to play board games. We used gorilla wood glue to make sure that it will last a long time. So far so good.

This is the most incredible coffee table not only does it have two drawers, which I love. It has more storage inside with three different tables, one small one one medium one and one that opens up into a big one, which I didn‚Äôt even realize until I assembled it. It‚Äôs like having a kitchen table, which I personally do not have because I never used it. So for those couch potatoes that like having friends over you‚Äôre gonna love it.the gray that I bought is so beautiful and it‚Äôs pretty sturdy as well. Absolutely love this coffee table. also, it‚Äôs extremely well pricedüëçüëç

I've been looking for a coffee table like this for a while. This was relatively inexpensive so I wasn't sure what to expect.Upon opening the package I realized that the materials were better quality than I expected. A proper script and not just the wood, The drawer slides and hinge for the top seem incredibly high quality.Additionally for something with this many moving parts it was relatively easy to assemble. And the instructions and packaging were some of the best thought out that I've ever seen. They have arrows pointing everything in the same direction and it only fits together one way, which helps because sometimes I misread the instructions. If I had to go back it was only a single step. Additionally all of the extra pieces came in a single package. Which means each fastener is packaged individually and labeled with what it is. When you run out of those you know you're done. However if you do lose one or need another piece and you'll find an extra one or two of everything in a small bag that comes with it.I just finished assembling this coffee table today. And it's already helping declutter the living room. I'm very excited that I won't have to move the coffee table anymore to eat on because it opens up and raises to the perfect height to eat on my couch.I don't usually get incredibly excited to spend money on furniture, but this was an amazing purchase. I highly recommend it.

Table is sturdy...but when it's fully open don't put any weight on it. Great for game nights and accommodating guests.Absolutely will need 2 people and about an hour to assemble. Comes with spare parts in case any of the parts are defective. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY AND USE THE PICTURES AND ITS EASY.

This is the prefect coffee table for my den.  Assembly is definitely 2 person job and took a little over an hour.  It is the perfect size, looks great,  feels sturdy and functions as intended.

Just what I needed. I added casters to the bottom and now I can move it around with ease.

Absolutely fantastic table, we pretty much use it fully everyday as a laptop station or fully open for dining.  Just a very well thought out and smartly executed table we adore!!!  Highly recommend!!!

While it took a little while to set up, we had everything we needed in the box including a real screwdriver! The lift functions work great, just be gentle! My man and I got this so we can store our ‚Äúgardening tools‚Äù inside and was worth the purchase :)

Far better than I was hoping for.  It looks like a highend piece for pennies on the dollar.Assembly: Let's get that out of the way.  It was tedious and took a lot of time, but oddly the instructions were all fairly clear.  Until you get to the final steps.  Be careful when putting on the top.  The arrows on mine told me to put the top on backward.  I would have had to remove it and do it twice.  We all know how fun that is.  Aside from that and needing help with the top it's not a hard build.Usage:  The drawers are more spacious that I would have thought.  Right now they're holding a lot of air, but it won't take long once we start unpacking.  The shelf is large enough for some baskets or flat boxes.  We filled it with photo albums.  What is supposed to be storage inside the top is frankly awkward to use.  You have to open the entire table to get to it.The Table:  Pulling up the table isn't difficult, but using it unfolded is easier with two people.  It's wonderful in a small house.  We don't have room for a dining room in our 800 sq ft house.  This seated four adults comfortably for a full set dinner.  My Mother and I are using it folded regularly with the sofa.Conclusion:  I'm glad we bought it.  I only wish we'd had one sooner.  Say in the last house where we were using old t.v. trays.  I highly recommend it.

I am really surprised by this table. I don‚Äôt expect it to be something I own for forever, but I do think I will get a lot of use out of it. Our house doesn‚Äôt have a living room but this folds out into a fairly attractive dining table. And as a coffee table it‚Äôs much nicer looking than other options I‚Äôve seen for fold-up dining tables. As others have commented, I wouldn‚Äôt use the storage space where the folding mechanisms are for anything heavy, but the drawers are the perfect size for extra vinyl storage and there‚Äôs the shelf below the table. The whole thing is surprisingly sturdy.It took a couple hours to assemble, which was reasonable given the sturdiness and moving parts involved. I wouldn‚Äôt try to do the installation of the moving table parts without a second person to hold those parts. The assembly kit came with a baggy of extra pieces, which was nice in case something wasn‚Äôt included or we lost something.

I love this easy to install directions were awesome.  Great size and pull out to huge table!  Very happy with this purchase!

I breezed through all the steps until the last two;  someone else recommended doing this and I agree it's so much easier.  Make sure you match the arrow stickers.  I couldn't be happier with the table itself.

We‚Äôve had this table for a month now and love it! We love the multiple ways to set it up and use it for everything from a coffee table to a work desk, to a puzzle table to dining. It was very easy to put together (the parts actually fit unlike many products). The only possible complaint is that fingerprints are super visible on the black material. Thats isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for us but might be for some.

We love this table. When the top is fully open it's perfect for game night. It does feel a little unstable as you are pulling the table up but I think it's because having the extra piece of wood makes it heavier. But once it's fully extended and in place it is definitely stable. The wood is also a beautiful color. The amount of storage is really nice to have.

Directions were very easy! Lots of storage, the table is perfectly high enough for our couch, both my mom and I can work with our laptops on it and still have drinks, miscellaneous things and still have room for other things! It‚Äôs not the highest end of materials but it‚Äôs a great middle of the road purchase and definitely worth the price!!

This is an excellent little coffee table that provides a nice amount of internal storage, and can even fold out to become a reasonably-sized table. Big enough for a board game with a few people, or for a small dinner gathering or just a place to put drinks.Probably one of the better/best pieces of furniture I've found on Amazon

I'm happy with how this table turned out and how, even though there are a lot of steps for assembly, the steps for assembly were really clear and easy to follow.

I love this kit! The company really thought things through. Page 1 of the instructions has an exploded view just to show you where all the pieces go, then they have you prep all the pieces. There is a bag of hardware labeled as extra pieces so you don't have to worry if there seems to be random extras. Every step is clear and methodical. The sticker covers have a wood design on them, so not just brown. It even comes with a screwdriver!With the exception of putting the top on, I easily did every step myself. With the help of a stack of books I was able to handle to awkward angle of the tips installation.The box arrived in the usuall shipped fashion, beat-up with gouges, but when I opened it, all those places were so thickly covered in Styrofoam that nothing was wrong with the wood!Based on the construction alone, I will be shopping this brand again!

I have a smaller home (less than 900ft¬≤) and a miniscule kitchen that doesn't fit a table.  We've done without for years but when I saw this product I was inspired.  It is perfect for our needs. We can dine and work in our living room now, and even have guests to eat with us.  We can play games again!The assembly was relatively easy with well-written instructions and a large portion of extra hardware just in case.I'll also add that the packaging is amazing.  The box arrived badly damaged by the shipped but all the board and parts within were protected.

I've never purchased a desk sight-unseen and was highly wary of doing so, but based on the cost, good reviews, and L-shaped style with some extras (including the keyboard tray) I was willing to give it a try.  Upon receiving the desk I was very impressed with the packing. It's heavy but very fortified inside to keep parts from being damaged.The instructions were very straightforward (for once) and well written. Also, I was very impressed by the build quality. Although the desk is pressboard/fiberboard with a laminate top, it looks good and feels solid. All of the screws and metal parts are machined very nicely and fit snugly. This feels like a desk from a higher-end manufacture. It's not amazing, but definitely very good quality.It does take some time to put this together (lots and lots of allen wrench screws) but once constructed it feels solid and looks great. A couple of things to note about the size:- The bottom or 'desk' portion is only about 19.5" deep.- The top or 'monitor' shelf is about 7.5" deep.- Because of the design and top shelf overlap you have about 22 1/4" from the front of the desk to the back of the top shelf.- Also, due to the design, there is a 2" gap of desk space underneath the top shelf (see photos). In other words, the bracket that holds the top shelf sticks back from the desktop about 2". This is a strange design choice to me as you could add another 2" to the desk surface under the top shelf and not have the brackets stick out further. It might look cool, but is definitely somewhat less functional. I am debating cutting  a 2" strip of plywood, painting it black, and securing it to the brackets to extend the desktop area. This way I could slide my computer, speakers and other items a bit further back and have more 'desktop' space.All that being said, I'm extremely happy with this desk. Most importantly, I am extremely happy with the customer service I received from Rolanstar (via the Amazon email/contact seller link). Initially, when I adjusted the legs up or down there was a loud 'clunk' before the legs started moving. I reached out to customer service and they were very quick to respond and help me solve the issue. It took a few back and forths to figure out the best solution but they were always very friendly and accommodating. I did have to wait some time for replacement parts to arrive, but again, they were quick to help and this has truly been the best customer service experience I've ever had on Amazon!I did install the LEDs under the top shelf and they're kinda cool (though I debated whether to bother installing at all) but, due to the glossy nature of the laminate, the single LEDs can be seen as little dots along the the desk. It'd be much nicer if these were diffused in some way. Or, just don't bother installing them.At any rate, I have my fingers crossed this desk will work well into the future. As of now, it sure feels like it will. I'd say if you are on the fence, take a chance.

I was a little skeptical when I came upon this desk, but I loved the natural wood coloring and it had everything I needed, plus some things I didn't know I needed. I put this desk together, by myself and it really wasn't that hard at all. It took me a solid hour and a half to put it together, but working alone, I'd say that's not too terrible. The desk went together without much fuss and is very sturdy. The only thing I'd like is if the memory setting automatically engaged to bring the desk up or down vs me having to press an arrow button then the memory setting (sometimes you have to press it more than once) to get the desk to automatically move up or down dependant on the setting. However, that is such a minor thing for me, which is why I didn't deduct points from the review; but if that is a deal breaker for you, at least you know up front. Otherwise, the desk is beautiful, functional and gives me so much more space than my old desk. The bonus was having the power strip inlaid in the desk as well as the spot to hang a purse/bag/headphones. All-in-all I'd say you can't go wrong with this desk!

Desk is messy in my picture but overall really like this desk. Compared to some options that are approaching $1000 this desk really gets the job done without breaking the bank. The motor has given me zero issues so far after around 3 months of usage.Pretty easy to assemble instructions are actually quite clear thankfully. Will definitely be easier with a second person if you happen to have one available but can be done solo. The lights are an enjoyable touch for anyone that enjoys changeable lighting. Overall would definitely recommend this desk. Being able to stand up when my body is crying out to not be stuck sitting any longer when actually working at the desk is a serious game changer.

I‚Äôve had the desk for about a month now and overall I‚Äôm happy with it.I had an issue with the first desk I received. It was delivered in awful condition and had been dropped at least once. The desktop was smashed up. This was an Amazon delivery issue and not the manufacturer. I got a replacement with no delivery issues this time.I live on my own and my office is on the second floor. The box is pretty large and very heavy. I just opened the box in my entryway and took the desk up in pieces. There are a lot of pieces.I put the desk together on my own as well. I am not good at building furniture and get flustered so I did it over a couple of days.  As others have stated you can do it on your own, but having someone to help is best. It was particularly difficult attaching the legs to the desk. They are heavy and if you are assembling on deep carpet have a tendency to want to topple over on your head. Again it‚Äôs doable but not necessarily advisable.Overall the quality is good but I do have some issues. The larger leg‚Äôs center foot would not screw in all the way. I tried another foot in that same spot and it also would not screw in so the issue is with drilled part in the leg and not the screw. Without that center foot the desk is more wobbly. Not awful but certainly noticeable. The second issue is the LED lights. They worked great on the first day but now they don‚Äôt smoothly transition from color to color. The transition is more staccato and borders on flashing. It is not on the strobe setting.Other than those two issues the desk is great. It seems durable, the raise and lower features are running smooth and the finish looks as advertised.

Ordered this desk as I just accepted a new WFH position. Arrived quickly and was packaged very well. Box is definitely heavy and hard to move but when I opened it you could tell care was taken during the packing process. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. All the tools needed to assemble came with and were clearly marked. Even got a few extras incase you dropped or last a screw along the way. Once assembled the desk was not hard or heavy to move. Quality is good and feels like it will last a long time. No noise when raising or lowering and I‚Äôm happy with the size over all. Love the LED and plug in options. Great cord management options as well. Overall very happy with my purchase.

I recently purchased the height adjustable desk Model CPT019-V2, and I must say, my experience has been nothing short of exceptional. Initially, I encountered a hiccup during assembly - a misalignment issue with one of the parts of the desk surface. However, the way the company handled my concern was outstanding.I reached out to customer support, detailing the issue and providing photographic evidence. Their response was incredibly swift and understanding. Without hesitation, they shipped out a replacement part, demonstrating their commitment to customer satisfaction and the quality of their products.With the replacement part, assembling the desk was a breeze. The instructions were clear, and putting it together took no time at all. Now that it's set up, I am thoroughly impressed with the desk. It's more than just a piece of furniture‚Äîit reflects the company's commitment to providing quality products and great customer service.The height adjustability feature is a game changer, offering the flexibility I need throughout my workday. The desk is fairly sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, and enhances my workspace in every way.I highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a reliable and stylish height adjustable desk. It's not just a nice desk ‚Äì the customer service and support experience were excellent. Kudos to the team for their exemplary service and for making products that truly stand out!

I work from home I spend 9 hours at my desk 5-6 days a week and my lower back would kill me so I bought this desk for the standing ability. This desk has exceeded all expectations. It rises quietly so no one can tell I am getting ready to stand the lights are perfect on it and it was easy to build.

It worked great for the first 3 months, until one of the motors died. Consulted the manual after receiving an error code on the display. The error code does not exist in the manual, so I scoured the internet before contacting customer service and having a week long conversation troubleshooting the issue. They finally decided to send me two new motors free of charge, which was nice! However, they come from China (no surprise) and took 2 weeks to arrive. To install the motor, you have to take the leg off... which is one of two structures supporting the weight of the entire desk... because the cover for the motor casing is on top of the leg... GENIUS!!!... pressed up against the underside of the desk... brilliant Chinese engineering.... When I got the leg off and opened the casing, the screws holding down the motor are so tight, you can't unscrew them without stripping the screws. So, now I have 2 shiny new motors to display on my bookshelf, how lovely!!! The desk, manual, and engineering/design are all trash. Don't waste your time, money, sweat, or tears on this and save yourself the disappointment!!!

I love this desk! Aesthetically pleasing and functional. It‚Äôs pretty heavy and big so assemble it in the spot you‚Äôre going to put it.  Love the led lights. Sturdy, lift function works well. Love having the power strip on the desk. It takes some patience and skill to assemble this and I see from many comments that people struggled. Remember, when you start, read the ENTIRE instruction guide before you start. It‚Äôs important, especially when assembling something with wires.

I'm in LOVE with this desk. It took my boyfriend and I a bit to assemble but it's BEAUTIFUL AND I LOVE IT! I work in IT so I'm on my computer for 8+ hours a day sitting, I also like gaming so I spend even more time sitting. For the times that I am sitting, I like sitting crisscross so I removed the little tray that slides out for the keyboard and mouse. I really wanted a raising and lowering desk so I could stand and even walk while working. But I REALLY needed an L shaped desk so I could fit my 3 monitors, PC, and laptop on this desk. I can easily fit 3 monitors, a stand up mic, a keyboard, a mouse, a PC, a laptop, an iPad stand, and I still have more room! I love that you can higher it and lower it and it even has two buttons you can set to whichever height you like so that you don't have to find that "perfect height" every time. It has led strips under the top portion of the desk which makes gaming so much more fun. And in the corner it has 2 USB-A slots and 1 USB-C slot along with 4 outlet plugs! Ever since I got this I also ordered an under the desk treadmill and now I easily get my 10k+ steps in while I'm working. I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase, and with the dark wood look, it's gorgeous! 100% worth every penny.

The wood's really thin. I wouldn't buy it again not for that price. It's too cheap.

The less important detail is that obtaining a tight fit between panels required tools not provided not mentioned, in my case at least.  There's no way to tighten a loose fit between leafs otherwise.  The bigger issue is the stability.  The feet are too ductile to support any weight on the side leaf.  Needs either stiffer bars or a third leg.

My keyboard tray dropped out after 6 months.  I had to replace the keyboard (because it broke) and had to replace the mouse (because it broke).  I work hard and long hours to make things work.  This fail costed me $842 US.

To help others please note the description and product description are conflicting. I read the description thinking the desk would be 61 inches but it's 58 by 43.note: Rolanstar Standing Desk, Dual Motor L Shaped Height Adjustable Desk with LED Lights and Charging Station, 61 x 46 inch Electric Sit Stand Desk, Rustic Brown Corner Home Office Desk with Monitor ShelfDeminsions: 43"D x 59"W x 30"H Both are wrong

The motors and functionality of this desk are 5 stars but the fasteners of the parts that hang down and the splices are kind of cheap. Both the keyboard and the cord hanger broke off within a couple days after having it. Had to drill new holes and use the proper screws to hang the keyboard drawer back up. Still haven‚Äôt fixed the cord hanger and you can see those are the holes in the picture

As some of the reviews state, there were screws which didn't fit. As a result there are pieces of the desk left unsupported. Additionally, as others have mentioned, a piece of the particle board came cracked (specifically the keyboard platform).The desk took about 2.5 hours to construct with one person.Overall, it's a good looking desk for the price.

This L-Shaped office desk was exactly what I needed and wanted for my home office. However,  after a hard labor to put it together, due to the struggle with screwing in the legs in properly. I came to realize this desk is a but shaky. If you lean on it with your arms, not heavy pressure, just a slight lean, you'll find yourself preparing to catch the desk and anything on it. It hasn't fallen, but I would suggest some type of leg support to prevent the shaking.  I do love the light feature and the ability to raise it. It goes pretty high, which is a plus because I am 5'8 1/2. Would I purchase it again, yes. It offers great desk space due to the extra monitor stands and L-Shape. What would I recommend the manufacturer do? Design this same desk with better leg support.  Desk should not feel like it's going to tilt at the slightest touch.

it's cramped. keyboard tray barely leaves room for the mouse with a full-size keyboard. super disappointing. would love modular replacements for the left-side of the desk and the keyboard tray. seriously, the left side of the desk and the keyboard tray would hugely benefit from being larger. seller, let me know please. also kinda iffy getting all the parts lined up.

The product was delivered with damage, it is only cosmetic however. It did take sometime to setup and there were some manufacturing issues that led us to do some minor alternations to the screw holes because they were misaligned.Otherwise it's beautiful and like the overall look, feel, and mechanics of the desk.

I finally broke down and bought this height-adjustable desk after four years of working from my kitchen table. It took me 3.5 hours to assemble because I was alone, but the instructions are pretty easy to follow. It looks great and I am SO happy to have a proper work space again. Everyone who has seen the desk in my house has commented on how good it looks.The only cons are fairly minor:1. The controls to adjust the height seem to be only in metrics and I haven‚Äôt been able to see how to switch to imperial (or if that‚Äôs even possible). No big deal; it just requires some conversion.2. I would have liked to see some built-in cable management. It‚Äôs kinda driving me crazy.3. This is a bigger issue - the keyboard tray sits MUCH too low (4.5‚Äù below the work surface) and isn‚Äôt adjustable. When I have the work surface adjusted for my height, I‚Äôm having to slouch in order to type, which completely defeats the purpose of having a height-adjustable desk. I was able to mitigate the problem somewhat by buying a floating shelf block of wood to set on the tray and boost my keyboard up, but I‚Äôll be looking for a more permanent solution. The main problem with swapping out the keyboard tray will be finding something that fits; the work surface is a little narrow and the underside is pretty much taken up by the desk‚Äôs own hardware. The photo of the keyboard tray shows WITH the extra block of wood I added.Still, it really is a nice desk for the price and I can live with the flaws.

I got this desk with a broken part.  Seller sent part for it's replacement.The desk is very functional, and the size is perfect.  I have a bad lower back, and bad arm and I work from home.I love the lights feature.  It has multiple colors and functions as well.I recommend it...if it comes broken beware that buyer is responsible for shipping and it cost about the same as the desk cost to ship.  Note box is extremely heavy so imagine my ordeal with a bad arm and back carrying this box.

This desk is just what I was looking for.  It's attractive.  It raises and lowers easily.  The electric outlets and USB ports on the top are very useful and it wasn't too hard to put together (took a few hours). And it wasn't very expensive.  I love it.  It did have some minor damage to a corner due to the shipper damage to the box but it wasn't the sellers fault and they did offer me $15 for it.

Was little difficult and time consuming to assemble alone but end result is amazing. its fully functional for a home office. led is also good

Cons: Building this was a bitch. But that might have been because I decided to do it by myself at midnight. One of the "screws" wouldn't go in at all no matter what angle I tried or the leverage used. People keep mentioning in their reviews how sturdy this is, but I find it a bit wobbly when fully extended. I don't think that one screw accounts for that. It wobbles when I am not touching it but am just bouncing on my rebounder. It wobbles when I touch it as normal to work. Maybe you aren't supposed to extend it fully. But then why does it go that high?Pros: But otherwise this desk is great once put together! It's beautiful. The movement up/down is smooth & quiet.  There's plenty of room but it also doesn't take up a lot of space somehow.The height is perfect for me to work using my rebounder, which is amazing & the combo has changed my life for the better. I am able to get really effective movement in all day long. It's super fun & makes my day go by faster. It keep my brain engaged when work is boring. It gives me an outlet when I'm frustrated. I get to have bouncy dance breaks throughout the day. I've lost weight.This desk allows the right amount of height & space below to accommodate my rebounder & even though it is wobbly I am glad I got it. It's really pretty. See pics.

Overall a good product.  The blowup pictures in the instructions could be better.  Some of the items not labeled.  The motors make the rise really smooth.

Love this desk. It's sturdy and easy to assemble, and looks great in my office. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because thr keyboard tray isn't height adjustable so it mostly just bumps against my legs when I'm sitting to work. I honestly might remove it and try to find something to replace it.

Absolutely love everything about this desk, it was easy to set up, the guide was easy to follow, the only thing was one of the pieces of hardware wasn't bent correctly like the others. So with a wrench and hammer I was able to bend it to the proper angle after some difficulty. Other than that love it!

You probably can't pick it up, but you can cartwheel it slowly and carefully.I followed the instructions step by step. Moved frame to the office room and added the wood and the electrical system. Took me a 3~4 hours total. My wife loves it. The LED is nice for ambience, but rather cheesy for anything serious. Basically flashing colored lights.In all, it's a very good desk!

I've had it for a week,  I love the adjustability. I may bring in a counter height stool I have in garage for a medium setting next week. I just haven't been able to get the memory settings to work, I'll keep trying.

The table is really good from quality perspective and everything is working really well and the table extension for the above portion is really well built and strong. The lighting is very nice as well it gives desk a really nice feel.

love this desk, it comes in handy during boring conference calls, I can stand up so I don't fall asleep lol.Buying a second one for at home.

I received the desk and one of the pieces was damaged. Notified the seller and they sent me a new piece. They responded quickly and took care of the issue. My desk is now complete and I love it. It's just right for my home office and the height is just right for me when standing (I'm 6'2"). Definitely recommend if you're looking for an affordable standing desk.

This is our second power desk. For his immediate tech setup, my husband has two rather large monitors mounted on a clamp brace, a laptop, and a separate ergonomic keyboard and mouse. The old power desk was becoming too cramped and also operated rather loudly. So after taking some measurements, he settled on this L-shaped desk.We wanted to open up space in the office and by going from a standard power desk to the L-shaped unit, it helped utilize space we weren't able to prior while actually opening up the center of the room. The desk is large enough that even with my husband's permanent work set up, I can hop in during his off-hours and set up my laptop for a call without disturbing his equipment.One of the first things that drew us to this particular desk was the built-in lights, the double-decker feature was also a highlight. We figured, that if the clamp could support the two monitors on the upper deck there would be even more usable space available. We were correct.A highlight of this particular power desk is it is whisper quiet. Sometimes I'll hear the initiation beep before it raises or lowers, but most of the time I don't even notice it. The fact I do not hear the motor whirring to go up or down is a nice benefit as the office is between our bedroom and the baby's bedroom and the desk could be heard from either room. Not fun at 7:30 am or nap time. The built-in light feature is pretty fun. Also, who doesn't like ambient lighting while working?There are two cons. The desk, due to the motor feature and steel supports, is very heavy. Very heavy. The second con is that the upper deck of the desk is a rather thin type of wood and my husband was scared at one point that he applied too much pressure on it while building the desk that it cracked. Thankfully a crisis was averted.It's been a little over a month and my husband is very satisfied with this purchase. We would definitely recommend.

fair amount of space one desk. i left the shelves off otherwise it would be cramped. otherwise, its a great desk.

It took 2 people to put it together.  Not easy to put together but I love how it raises and lowers, I'm really hoping it will help with my neck issues.

Top 3 Likes:- Customer Service is top tier: they sent me an entirely new desk since I was facing an issue with my left leg's motor not working.- Appearance: Carbon Fiber material is really sleek- Size: Excellently sized for the price, I'm able to setup all my DJ/Music Production equipment, as well as my gaming pc accessories.Dislikes:- Although not a massive issue, all desk components came in one package, so it was extremely heavy. If split into two to three packages, the desk would be much more manageable to take into your home upon receipt.- Not really any other blaring dislikes, you get MORE than you pay for here, when including the excellent customer service, and amazing value squeezed into this item: Adjustable height, two tiered layout, keyboard pullout, RGB light strips, and conveniently placed USB/power hubs.Thanks for reading, and thanks Rolanstar for the product!John

Good, steady, and low noise.

This is a great desk for the price.  So far, I have no complaints.  It's sturdy enough for all my monitors on the top shelf and plenty of room on the desktop.

nice table

I put this together by myself.  All the tools are included.  I am in love with my new desk.  Even though it is bigger than my old desk,  I feel like I have more room in my office.  It also goes up much higher than my old desk.  I have two 24" monitors, one 19" monitor and my laptop on my desk and still have plenty room for other things.

Great product

Exactly as I expected

Easy to put together. Good instructions. Did it by myself in about an hour. Love that I can stand or sit. Zero complaints  (I did not install the keyboard drawer since I wouldn't use it)

Desks are a good build. I ended up breaking one of the panels due to my chair being under the desk and lowering it. They sent a completely new desk with no cost.

Bought for high school son- He loves the lights, ability to stand or sit at desk and the overall look. Great buy!

This desk was super easy to put together, it just took some time. Very sturdy, even in standing mode. The strip of lights it comes with is also really nice. I love the outlets on the top of the desk. Only caveat is that it is really heavy. The box it was in was 107lbs. Just keep that in mind. Mine had to go up a flight of stairs and it worked well since there were two of us, but I bet it would've been a struggle if it was just me

I bought this just under a year ago after moving to my new home. It is used in my studio as my synthesizer stand and also my workstation. In that time being subjected to noise and vibration form the audio setup It had 1 screw come loose while I was re0arranging. the surface is a surprisingly durable and scratch resistant laminate and is holding up well. no issues with the ambient led lighting strip, and I raise and lower it multiple times without any sign of the motors wearing down or anything. Got this thing for under 300 bucks with an additional purchase coupon applied and considering similar desks go for 400 - 700 buck, this was the deal of a lifetime and I wish I had gotten 2 of them.

The desk was fairly easy to assemble, but be careful.  A couple of pieces I started to assemble upside down and I had to reassemble.  Other than that, the instructions are super easy to follow and anyone can assemble.  The desktop is a little thinner than I wanted, but it is surprisingly durable.  I'm super happy with it.

This desk is amazing! I work from home and spend a minimum of 8 hrs a day working and needed a desk that is comfortable and fits my 3 monitors plus laptop, keyboard, mouse, lamp, all of the things without impeding on my space to comfortably work.  This checks all of the boxes.  It took me about 4 hours to assemble by myself (female) and it went well considering the instructions are all photos no written words.  I definitely recommend.*note:  apparently Amazons company policy is not to deliver passed the 2nd floor.  (I live on the 3rd floor) the driver was extremely rude about it, and I contacted support to verify his claim and it is accurate, but of course Amazon does not clearly state this on the listing and the package is 115lbs!  The only reason I ordered from Amazon was to have it delivered to me, it was listed cheaper on another website that I could have picked up myself for about $75 cheaper!

This is the perfect desk for sitting and standing. Tons of space for work setup. I have 2 large monitors and a laptop set up for my work station.

Very well made.

It arrived 1 day earlier than expected.  It was very heavy to bring into the house.  The parts were packed really well and clearly marked.  The instructions were pretty good although I do think the LED lights should go in front of the brackets, not behind.  It was fairly easy to put together.  It took me about 90 minutes to assemble.  The desk itself is sturdy and seemingly well-built.  The controls for moving the desk up and down are very easy to use and I love the memory settings.  Don't hesitate to buy this desk!

This desk is heavy and high quality. I love how high the standing function raises and the programmable functions. I was looking for a desk with built in outlets and was excited to see that this one included 4 three-prong outlets, as well as two usb ports and one usb-c. The lights are super adjustable as well. This is a really good desk for the price

Actually a very functional desk that is quite when moving up or down. I Like the led lights that can be easily turned on and off as needed. Not much I would change

Set up was easy enough, lots of space for a laptop and multiple monitors. The 2nd tier as well as the keyboard shelf leave plenty of room for working. Rises up quietly and seamlessly.

Recently upgraded my work desk to this and ready love it. Perfect size! Love the standing and sitting option and fits 3 monitors nicely!

Precise manufacturing, with easy-to-follow instructions. Assembled quickly, and the motor function is perfect!

I like how nice it looks now that it‚Äôs together.  instructions were very easy to follow.  don‚Äôt be in a hurry when you get it because it takes time - lots of parts.

This ergonomic desk is everything! It took a minute to assemble, even with two people. It is very solid, weighing 100 lbs. So be sure to tip your delivery driver. The keyboard tray is a little  shake when it fully extended. It has a very smooth in and out action, but the slides feel slightly oily to the touch. I am not sure it's necessary and I would have preferred a little drawer there instead. All in all, it goes up and down  like I wanted, and I am very happy with the value proposition. It was a big upgrade to my home office.

Exactly as described. Took about 3 hours to assemble. I did it alone though so I'm sure with two people it would move faster. All parts were labeled well. I like that the LED strips are pre-cut to the proper lengths in advance and so no worries about doing the splicing myself. Love the programmable memory for different height levels so I can just push one button to get the height I want.

I work from home and I was a bit hesitant to spend this much money on desk but needed something that can go up and down easily. I have 3 monitors and love that they sit up higher above the desk itself. I appreciate that I can set 2 heights so I don't have to adjust it each time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing a standing desk.

High quality L shaped standing desk from the design for ease of assembly, sturdy materials, and all the way down to the packing material.  I am very impressed and will be looking to the Rolanstar company for furniture in the future.

This desk took me several hours to assemble but was very sturdy.  I have three monitors and two laptops, and this fits perfectly.  Although the wood is particle board, all of the mounting points have excellent threaded connections.  Overall this was even better than I expected.

Updated review: this desk is absolutely perfect and I‚Äôm completely in love! The operation is quiet and smooth. Assembly was easy although it did take a bit of time. I love the way it looks and it functions perfectly for my work from home needs. I would definitely buy it again. As for the original review: the company was quick to get me a copy of the instructions. If I remember correctly, they emailed them over the same day I contacted them. Customer service has been amazing so far!Original review: Product arrived earlier than expected. Which would‚Äôve been great.. except that there are no instructions or manual in the box. So my excitement for my new desk was quickly squashed by frustration. I did try to call and email, but have not received a response yet. I will reevaluate my review once I can actually try the desk out.

This desk is a very nice desk for the money.  It was well packaged and the instructions were well done and easy to follow.  The keyboard drawer was not something I like and use so I removed that.  LED lights are great.  Has a blinking features on them that I can't imagine anyone using.  Doesn't have just plain white LED light which I would have liked.  All-in-all very nice and would recommend!

Customer service was pretty on point! Even though I wasn't actually missing parts as I thought I was.. Great desk! Moves up and down so smooth my drinks barely move.

Received the package. 5 screws didn't go in. the rest worked fine. need better quality controlAs a follow-up, the seller reached out and offered a replacement. I received the replacement. The service is great! They want to make sure you have a table that functions well and meet the expectation.

Good deal for the money.  Couldn‚Äôt use the back shelves because the monitors sit too high for my eyes, but everything else works perfectly

I like the way it runs. It‚Äôs not loud you can set up those timers pretty easily simple to use. Great quality like metal frames pretty sturdy it‚Äôs not fake.

its heavy and it takes some mental energy and a few hours to assemble but the guide is clear and its not too frustrating. as a desk though its absolutely amazing i love it. make sure you plug it into its own outlet though, it kept shorting my surge protector when i changed the height. i love this desk its great

I searched various stand up desks and this one matched my budget and had good reviews. Glad I purchased it. Easy setup with clear instructions. This desk looks expensive and works great. The second shelf space really male's the desk spacious. I am able to put my 2 large monitors and laptop and have plenty of room left. I would recommend.

I knew it can change LED colors and rise up and down, but I had no idea my desk could STROBE!  Loving it!  Easy to assemble too!!!

Very, very thin coating, and comes damaged. The shelf has a big chunk missing from the corner, and a scratch on the top. The main desk top has scrapes and chips all along it. Sent the seller pics of the major damage, and they offered a $15  refund. That's not going to get it repaired.  I paid for brand new. Waiting to hear back from seller. If no resolution, will be returning for full refund. Will update.Update: $30 was offered and accepted because I would be required to get it to a UPS store to ship back. Nice gimmick.

Missing screws for the outlet portion and the upper part is way too small for any monitor. Disappointing but way too bulky to send back. Just don't buy.

Don‚Äôt recommend

No instructions came on putting the desk together.

POS desk arrived broken and missing pieces. Have to drive around town to return a big piece of broken crap! Zero stars!!

Had the desk for under a month and the light stripe has already given out and broken. It won‚Äôt turn on. Desk is nice but quality isn‚Äôt high. I would like the lighting to be replaced!

The desks they are selling are a foot shorter then what the description says. Then they give you the run around when trading messages back and forth with them.  Bad seller, false desk measurements,

False picture of desk. Looks like the full desk lights up as blue but indeed it‚Äôs just a small portion. False advertising.

We had a specific measurement requirement to fit a desk in to for gaming, and this was the desk I landed on after days of searching.True to size. Everything works great! We love the LED lights, and the plug in panel on the desk.  Allows for a clean cord set up!  The cup holder and head set holder with great and are sturdy.The desk itself was simple to put together, my son did it himself, and I did the final touches the following morning. It‚Äôs study but lightweight.Great value for the price point on this desk, especially with all the extras that come with it.

Well packaged and easy to put together.  While the instructions are not the greatest, it was easy to put this together.  The cup holder is something I did not attach since it didn't work for my placement of the desks. Overall good value, feels very sturdy, kids love the LED lights and different settings and the fact they can plug their phones in right at their desks.

Everything fit perfectly and I like this set up. The only thing that made me not give it 5 stars was the Type-C port did not work. We tried different cords, name brand and not. Nothing worked. All of those cords worked on multiple outlets and also connected to my console. That aside the set up was easy. Took me about 10 to 15 minutes and it looks great!

It was easy to assemble.  Looks great

WoW!!!!  I don't know what to say.  Fast shipping.  Very easy instructions.  Took me about an hour to complete. Dat cause I'm old. But when I tell you. That table is very Sturdy/Strong!!! Luv the LED lighting. Cup holder/Headphone rest.  Absolutely Luv it!!!!!!  Very Hateirh purchase!!!!!  Many Thanks!!!!!

This is a great size for 2 kids to play at.

Took me three days to assemble since it was my first time assembling something but it was worth the hassle.

It's a sturdy table and a quality product despite what it's price might imply.  Only complaint I have is that I don't currently have the room for a larger model.

Ok so I have horrible luck when it comes to building things. But I couldn‚Äôt find someone to help put this together so 3 1/2 hours later and I have a great little desk üòÇ For a normal person it would have taken far less time but I kept putting stuff on backwards and,for me, trying to get the holes lined up was a monster. I got a few good screams in to help with the  frustration but all in all I‚Äôm really proud! I do wish there was a remote for the lights instead of just my phone but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.

I bought this desk for my 16 yr old son. He put it together all by himself. Let me tell you, he loves it. It's sturdy & nicely built.I also like the fact that it was delivered vert earlier than the time expected. This is a good purchase üëå.

Unfortunately, we need it now.. or I‚Äôd of sent it back.Update: seller reached out unexpectedly to make a kind gesture of making things a little better for us, so I added a star to the rating due to great customer service. It‚Äôs nice to see that they care when issues arise.

Assembly wasn‚Äôt too hard I did it by myself & It has space for the monitor but after that it‚Äôs pretty much only space to put a few things in front of the monitor

Good table overall but second shelf flimsy not so strong .

Bought this desk as I needed something that can hold 2 monitors, 1 for work and 1 for personal.  Trying to assemble this solo was a workout and a half.  I did get it together, some of the CNC was a bit off and now the monitor stand is slightly angled down at the front side.  Aside from that, it's a good desk and pretty solid.  I took someone's advice and put the light strip near the back, and it makes a huge difference. Update: because of the poor drilling and top shelf brackets not being level, causing the top shelf to angle, my one monitor has already fallen several times.  Be prepared for this.  I had to resort to sticking something between the main desk and the monitor shelf to prevent the monitor from falling any more.

I just finished assembling it and I thought at first it was unstable because I didn't finish, but when I was done and tightened all the screws the table is still unstable. Not sturdy at all and I feel like it's not safe to handle high value monitors...

We are just assembling it now and realized I should have measured the size of 47‚Äù I guess because this desk is tiny. The ones in the photo look about twice this size in length. Disappointed in the photos. Feels like false advertising to me because 55‚Äù one is not twice as long either.

Top portion is smaller then expected

This desk is super nice. Has a lot of room to expand the dual monitors with my laptop.Only con: The Carrier delivered to the wrong address location and took a week between myself & the Carrier (UPS) to find out what happened. No help from Amazon when the package was missing for 5 days afterwards. A lot of push back. Very disappointing experience. We decided to keep it even though I had purchased another during those 5 days.

Was for my son, he likes it. He gets frustrated with the bar going across the back, it hits the rollers on the chair and prevents going forward at times due to being a bit shallow.

No dislikes I‚Äôm satisfied

My husband set it up for gaming and I also use it for online school. It works pretty well and doesn't look bad. It's not very heavy duty or fancy looking but it serves its purpose well.

Assembly did take a few minutes for sure however when it was completely put together it is a great desk.  Nice touch and its currently in the media room for when were gaming.

This product came packaged durably. Instructions were easy to follow and set up was simple. Seems super durable and easy to move around.

Desk is pretty good. Its slim and long. The desk has nice leg room and space for dual monitors.The cup holder is a nice touch and the lights are pretty sick as well. Having many different colors and modes, overall another nice touch. I ran into a problem building it, like how the support poles on the  back were bent in a weird way, making it difficult to screw it on. Other than that, my son like it a lot compared to his old desk.

Overall I love it the led is awesome can‚Äôt wait to get the app setup so I can connect it to my music. Took me 2 hours to put it together but I also took a few mini breaks

My cat jumps onto it. Not a big cat about 5 pounds but still. I have enough faith in the build of this desk to know that even with my two monitorz on it it's fine. A bit of support is needed though on the plateau which is why i give it 4 rather than 5 but this can easily be shimed with some support or bibelot.

I originally had a rather large desk for my work office that was taking up way too much space. I decided I wanted to downsize. After browsing on Amazon for several days I finally decided on getting this desk.It fits both of my monitors on the upper shelf great and there's enough space for the laptop to sit in the middle for a kind of triangle view setup. With the built-in LED lights, it can save on both space and power if I want some kind of light to see with. I recommend this desk for anyone looking for something that has just enough space for everything they need.Word of warning, however. Do not place anything too heavy on the top shelf as it can get top heavy and fall over backwards, especially when you try to move it back.

Nice and easy to assemble

I've had this desk for almost 2 months now. It was pretty easy to assemble. I made a few mistakes, but easily corrected them. LED lights work well and have had zero issues with them. My only issue is that the raised platform is a little small for my monitor stands, and if i have my arms on the desk and move, my monitors rock back at forth. So i think the upper platform could use a little bit of additional reinforcement. Otherwise i really like this desk. I wont be getting rid of it anytime soon. Well worth the price.

Bought two of these carbon black desks. Fairly priced. If put together properly then it‚Äôs sturdy.

We had the desk put together for a half an hour before the cup holder and head phone holder and they both fell out. We are now being sent a new one so hopefully it was a one off. There customer service has been wonderful

Quality and just all around a great desk.

I was confused on how to assemble the top shelf at first but as it turned out I was reading the instructions incorrectly. I absolutely love it. I was limited for space so for a year I've been looking for a small gaming desk that would fit at the bottom of my bed. I love it.

Kinda confusing but I love it, sturdy too

Great desk at a great price!! Love the upper shelf for 2 monitors!! Glad it has plugs and usb ports on the desktop too!!

My grandson loved the different hues of light and it was the perfect fit for his new room.

Desk was correct size for what it was stated for

Loving my new desk! Great quality and size. Item just as described.Highly recommend

Came quick. Easy to put together. Pretty sturdy for the value. My 13yr old son loves the lighting effect. You can even use your phone to control them with your voice. He loves it. I was surprised at the sturdiness! Look nice too!

I love this desk! It's just the right size for my space and super easy to install plus light weight. The color changing lights are my favorite part

The table surface, the elevated shelf, and the AC + USB power outlets are a very good combination for a secondary computer work area (no gaming) in a bedroom where I can hide from my active cat who craves physical human attention.  The monitor is on an arm clamped to the shelf, which holds the monitor at the right height to be just above the laptop screen tilted at a good angle.  Dual USB power jacks power a lightbar atop the monitor and a Fire TV dongle plugged into the back of the monitor.  I like the configuration!This comes in kit form and it was very easy to assemble, though it took over an hour because of having many pieces.  Really good instructions and packaging to support assembly.Others may appreciate the "gamer" aesthetics including a LED strip with adjustable color that goes under the shelf and the "carbon fiber" appearance.  Those features increase the selling price but do not add any value for my applications.

Everything

the only thing that i do not like about this desk is that i wish it was higher but this is a very good desk i love it and i been having it for 2 months and it still feels good

This desk is solid and my kids loved them!! Easy to assemble and powered! If you need a space, consider this one!!

I see a lot of people complaing about parts not fitting right and i just want to say that the only reason parts dont fit on the product are because of user error. If you dont have anything backwards then everything fits perfectly. Directions might not be perfect but with a little critical thinking its easy to figure out and avoid mistakes.

Great for pc gaming.  The lights make it cool especially at night.

I been looking for a gaming table that had the plugs on top, and the holders. Didn't realize that was hard to find until I found this one. Plus it has that extra top and LED . My son loves it. Great gaming desk definitely recommend,  wasn't to bad to put together  just wish directions didn't just show pics but maybe said how it goes, we had one part turned the wrong way and had to go back and undo alot to fix it.

Happy with this purchase. Bought for my husband's closet converted mini office. It was somewhat easy to assemble and lightweight but sturdy. I like the shelf because it holds a monitor and mini fan to keep gaming console cool. The tabletop outlet and USB ports are great for charging a phone or laptop easily. I like that the cup holder can be moved to either side of the desk without getting in the way of leg room.

Usually my bf handles all the building, but I did not want to wait. Luckily this was the easiest piece of furniture I‚Äôve put together thus far. Instructions were clear, pieces were clearly labeled. The hardest part was hauling out the old desk to make room for the new one! The quality of the desk seems great for the cost. I bought it for my teenage son, he hates everything but he doesn‚Äôt hate his new desk!!

Great desk‚Ä¶.goad I bought this desk over my other choice.

Easy to assemble and great value

Easy to put together

Easy to put together. Lights are an amazing added bonus

Bought for my 17 year old son who loves it. Exactly as pictured, he put it together quickly

Great starter desk or if you just need a smaller desk will fit in any bedroom corner

Very happy with this little desk.

Easy to assemble

Easy to assemble and looked great

My son is going to love this desk. It's a Christmas gift üéÅ

I got the 31.5 size. Easy to set up, sturdy and good price. The led lights, ac outlets built into the desk, headset hook, and cup holder are cool features.

Great desk

Not a bad desk, but no pink lights :( but they have purple so that's ok.

Loved it

Looks and works prefect

We gifted this desk to our grandson this month and he loves it. The smile on his face was so big!  With dad‚Äôs help they had it together in no time and he was gaming in style.

I needed a desk for an area that was a bit cramped but I still needed 2 monitors and a docking station to fit on it. This one worked nicely for my needs. I really like the carbon fiber style finish especially with the way the lights illuminate the surface and wall behind the desk. The desktop seems durable and easy to clean. The desk makes good use of space with the monitor shelf, built in receptacles, dual headset hanger and even a drink holder to avoid spills on my electronics. This thing is heavy so it‚Äôs nice and sturdy as I work on it. It was fairly easy to assemble, no better or worse than any other prefab furniture. It has a good height for both the primary surface and the monitor riser, at least for this 5‚Äô6‚Äù reviewer. The look during the day is great but at night with the lights, it‚Äôs spectacular. I do not, however, like having to set up an app to control it. It‚Äôs too intrusive. Luckily I have a spare tablet with no personal information on which I install all potentially sketchy apps. If you need something modern with a sturdy design, this is a good option.

This was easy to put together and the charging port is awesome, has 2 usb ports and plugs in the side of the desk. And light strip to put under the top shelf too. I am using it as my craft desk n the living room right now it plan on moving it into my office as both a computer desk and craft desk - there‚Äôs plenty of room for both. It‚Äôs very sturdy and was really easy to put together and the desk top is nice and solid not thin or flimsy. Plenty of leg room and I have a gamer chair that I use it‚Äôs it and it fits perfect and the right height. Would recommend and great price for this good of a desk.

pretty easy to assemble, my 14 year old did it almost by herself.  As described.

We ordered this for my son for his room. We are creating him a "gaming zone" in there and this desk fit the bill. It was pretty simple to put together with no real issues and it looks really nice for for his room. I like the design on the top and the lights make it super fun for him! I love how you can use the top shelf for the monitor or also a nice place to put a lamp or books.

We got his older brother a similar desk, so of course we had to get my younger son a good gaming desk. He likes the red lights under the top shelf. It has plenty of room for one or two mid-sized monitors up top and a full-sized mousepad on the bottom.

This desk is quite nice and perfect for small rooms. It has a sturdy and stable feel making it great for a kids room. This can easily be used as a gaming desk for single monitors. We are using as a standard desk. The upper shelf is perfect for a small desk lamp, a couple of books, a small plant, and a monitor leaving the lower desktop open for keyboard, mouse and the paperwork. Overall it‚Äôs comfortable to use. I‚Äôm very happy with the design , quality and value. Assembly is fairly simple with instructions clearly written and easy to understand.  Definitely a nice addition to our small room.

The Seven Warrior gaming not only has a nice name but it is a great desk. The Desk itself is pretty sleek and minimal but has a nice design. Its actually very easy to assemble this desk less than an hour. Its pretty strong and stable. Comes with colorful LED lights and a desktop power strip. Monitor riser throughout the back provides more desk space. fantastic carbon fiber textured finish on the top. Overlal a really great value desk at a great price.

Number one, it is NOT, I repeat, NOT, worth the money.  Secondly, YES very easy to assemble.  It is stable, not sturdy, but stable.  I mean the framework is stable.  The drawers are cheaply made and have a strange odor.  I assembled it myself, no problem, the instructions are very easy to follow.  It's just not worth the money.

Lasted about a month before the lights stopped working and one of the drawer rails won't stay in place because the screw hole is loose only thing I use it for is makeup and they are cloth drawers can't have anything heavy in them anyway expected it to last longer than a month I imagine another month itll be unusable.

Really wish I could give 0 STAR. I wanted a pink desk, but nothing flashy or extra shelves for multiple monitors. Simply a pink desk for my daughter to draw and do crafts. So I settled for this that advertised there was a pink light option. I assure you, no. Did not know this until everything was screwed in and ready to go.

The product arrived today it I've been trying to build it for the last 3.30 hours and it is still incomplete due to guideline being wrong about a certain important part. On top of that, secind biggest part arrived cracked and one of the pieces didn't arrive. It is small enough to be put nearly everywhere but a damaged product is no good for anyone.

Bought this desk for my college apartment. When I opened the package, the main base board was broken in two different spots. Had to returned to get a replacement. Will see if the replacement is better!

In descriptions they saying, it‚Äôs melamine wood But I. real wife, all drawers made of fabric and paper it‚Äôs not gonna last even a few months, had to send it back.

This product is terrible the holes didn‚Äôt line up the outlets didn‚Äôt work I bought for my daughters dorm and had to throw away bc the top part brok bc the holes didn‚Äôt line up

Exactly as shown, except for the lighting, easy to assemble very sturdy. Have sent 2 different emails to seller for replacement lights and haven‚Äôt gotten any response as of yet. Customer service is not good at all.*Update*3 Weeks later still no resolve, will never buy from this brand name again, please pay attention to whom your purchasing from.

Why are there two sets of opposite instructions? Quality is crap since the connectors don't fully fit. Wonder if this will last six months..

Have chemical smell after a month, and very friable

This product was full of dead roaches.Horrible experienceVery unacceptable

Terrible desktop

This desk is made of cheap Materials!  Literally the ‚Äúdrawers‚Äù are cloth boxes made for cube storage.  We put my daughters skincare in one drawer and I tried to pull the drawer out from underneath it and it wouldn‚Äôt even open because the one on top says down from the weight of her skincare which isn‚Äôt even heavy!  Super dissatisfied!

I returned the table because it didn't suit me, but unfortunately I am not being refunded, why am I not being refunded for the table???!!!

missing parts, instruction not accurate, cheaply made, what do you expect from china.  DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!!!!!!!

I went to put this desk together today and noticed on the support bracket there was no hole to place a screw in on the desk along with the other holes were missing the metal thread pieces rendering everything completely useless. I am very un happy.

In order to use this desk's app, you need to download the LotusLantern app. Which is fine.But no matter what you do, the LED's will not turn white or yellow. The whole reason I bought the desk was for yellow LED background. As is in the photos provided. The LED's, no matter which setting you choose, are blue. Green-blue, purple-blue, blue-blue. No option for white or yellow. White does nothing but turn it blue, the middle of the RGB wheel in the app turns it blue.I've already assembled the desk and I will not be shipping it back. I wasted 150 dollars on this desk, two hours of time to put it together and a lot of headache trying to even find which app to use with it.So now I have a blue LED desk... let's go? I guess??

Bought my kid a bed from this seller and added the matching desk.  Step 2 and it has already gone sideways.  Part 5 depicted is missing a pre drilled hole to attached the main drawer slide assembly to the desk top.  It basically stops assembly cold.  Only option for return is to figure out how to stuff the Tetris of pieces of this 45 lb desk (including packing) and carry it to the post office or a purolator.  (I dont drive, hence using amazon). All I want is the piece and amazon nor the seller make it easy on Amazon.  Very disappointed.  If it were a missing pre-drilled wood hole, I wouldn't fuss and make it work.  It is a heavy metal piece that is missing the pre drilled hole.  I dont know many people who would have those tools handy.  Service and product are a let down.

This is a scam, I‚Äôm just surprise, you never can‚Äôt do that to people , you have to let people know what you want to sale them.You have to return my money back and you have to come and fix your box.Because you did it SCAMüò°All drawers are cloths materials. This desk is made of cheap Materials! Literally the ‚Äúdrawers‚Äù are cloth boxes made for cube storage. We put my son skincare in one drawer and I tried to pull the drawer out from underneath it and it wouldn‚Äôt even open because the one on top says down from the weight of her skincare which isn‚Äôt even heavy! Super dissatisfied!

There is missing hole for step 2. Also, the holes are not big to install the screws.Now the return part is also very disappointing. They will not pick it up. I will have to drop it in a Purolator or Canada Post.Not recommending this at all.

After just about getting this item together found out the top part was damaged. What should we do? Send it back ?

While installing the legs the left side fell over and ripped out the nuts on the desk top.

Never made it past step 3. The stress would not screw in.

So bad quality

Have had for less than a month now and the USBC stopped working. Absolute bs.

Poor quality

Two big drawers are not very handy, it should have some support under to get them in and out.

I received the desk today and I‚Äôm having trouble assembling it because it came with the wrong instructions

I bought this desk & as soon as I opened the box there was pieces of wood all over it, lo and behold it had a whole corner broken off. I really love how the desk looks & it‚Äôs the perfect size for my space so I‚Äôm going to replace it & see if next one comes in better condition.

This is the second desk I bought. First one came in great shape; my kid is enjoying his desk; but the second and third one, which was the replacement for the second one, they both arrived with a pice creaked from side to side. I returned them and left a little disappointed since I like the product.

I obviously didn't read the description thoroughly and when the desk came, it had fabric drawers. They feel and look cheap. The desktop also came in a smashed box with a crack through the top. One of my saddest buys from Amazon.

Product arrived cracked. Difficult to put together. Once assembled, the product was sturdy.

Overall it is a sturdy desk, but sometimes the lights do not work. It also did not come with a screw hole for one of the drawers so sometimes that handle will droop down because it has nothing to anchor onto the other side.

After unpacking the product from the box there was a dent om the top of the desk.

No where in the product description did it say the drawers were fabric. The top is sturdy but over time these fabric drawers will fall apart. I could have purchased a small desk with real drawers at a local store for this price.

Nice desk. Corners of desk arrived all nicked up despite all the extra Packaging it arrived in. üòí

I intended to use the desk for artwork, and was hoping I could get a neutral white color from the LED to help illuminate my space.  Unfortunately the LEDs have a very strong blue tint - "yellow" mode appears green, and "white" mode appears blue.  This makes these lights pretty much useless for art.  I bought two of the same desk and the LEDs in the second one also appear very blue, so it's probably just low-quality lights.  Even with the recommended app I wasn't able to get anywhere close to an acceptable white.

This desk is the perfect size for me, easy instructions to follow, fine in 1hr 30 and I took my time. Lights works so far. The only thing I don‚Äôt like are the drawers.. made fabric, vinyl and bottom made of cardboard. Obviously I didn‚Äôt read properly before I ordered this desk. Amazon was the best price for this desk and was delivered within 24 hrs.

I disliked that I paid for a damaged product

Great product. Took about 30 minutes to set it up. It comes with a step by step assembly instructions and all the tools you need to put it together. The instructions are very easy to understand and follow thru without any confusion. Perfect for a decent size work desk or could also be suitable for children to do schoolwork on it. There is also LED lights that you would run them under the top platform to give it a nice ambient light to the desk. Also, the drawers are not your typical wood ones. These are those that you could unfold and put a cardboard to set the base of the drawer. Also, I would recommend getting a monitor mount for your computer monitor or if you're a gamerwith multiple screens to free up more surface on this desk and also would give it a clean look. Overall the desk is pretty sturdy, decent and looks great.

Easy to put together. Not heavy. Ok quality for the price. It‚Äôs the right size for the space I have in my living room. It‚Äôs functional for my needs. The drawers are almost like fabric, not a deal breaker ; just have to be careful. It‚Äôs confortable to work on it. I love, love the lights features. At night when the living room lights are off and these ones are on, it looks so pretty.

I love it! We got the 47 inch in black. It was pretty easy to assemble. It comes with a little screwdriver and it's a good one. It came with a little string of LED lights that change color and you can even download an app if you want the lights to blink to the music. It is a pretty solid desk. The drawers are a bit flexible, and fabric covered.  It has a solid bottom on the drawers which helps with that. Only gave 4 stars because while  sturdy the drawers could have been a bit better. Give it a shot. So far, I am very pleased.

I am writing this review that day I got it, and will update if anything changes, however... this is not only the most perfect cute little desk but the assembly was by far the least stressful.It comes not only with the hardware you need, including extra just incase, but it gives you all the tools you need. Always hate having to go find a screw driver or something. The allen wrench it gives you is also the ball point one. You know when items you put together give you an Allen wrench, but then screws are too close to so obstructing object making it awkward to tighten so you have to keep taking it of reposition and tighten more? Well with these ones you can turn it at an angle so it's waaaay more maneuverable.LEDs are awesome, drawers are lightweight efficient cloth/hardboard drawers with lots of space. LED strip has lots of color options and it's sturdy with adjustable feet for leveling. One note of fact is the LED strip will use one of those USB ports on the power strip.Desk feels slightly smaller length wise (I got the bigger one) than I anticipated, but it still is very spacious and has lots of depth specially because you can put your monitor on the top boards.

Super cute and simple. Honestly super easy to put together, worth the money and it‚Äôs not expensive! Super smooth and soft edges completely comfortable! Very sturdy and works great now I just have to decorate it!

As an older female, assembly can be challenging. The hardest part of this was opening the box. The instructions, though pictures, were good! Anywhere that I may have went wrong, there was a note showing me the correct way.The desk itself is sturdy and nice looking.

The instructions were soooooooo clear it was very very helpful. I loved the desk it‚Äôs perfect I got the 39inch and it was perfect really fits well in room and is sturdy could not recommend any more for value of money

I needed to replace my old desk with something that would allow to keep a desktop under the table, have enough room for a 32" monitor, soundbar BR and DVD player and have at least 5 drawers to keep extra periphery/documents. I am very constricted on space and 39 inch table top was a good option for my choice. Overall, this product is not bad. I do not intend to sit behind it, but rather use it as a TV stand/gaming PC hub, so leg room is not that important. My 22" tall desktop fit right under the table just fine, so did the monitor, sound bar and DVD/BD players. Five drawers provide ample space. The table is light and comes with adjustable foot pegs, so it can be raised another 2-3 inches if neededNow to bad parts: the wood quality is not that great. I tried attaching legs to the table top and screws went straight through. Good thing I was able to patch it up with stickers that came in the box. If I's had to use the table for something other than a TV stand, I would be upset. I like that the power box it came with has multiple plug ports, including 2 USB and a USB-C.Instructions are pretty confusing, you have to pay a very close attention which way each part faces and in which order the screws go in. But at least, it came with instructions. So, overall, decent desk for your money.

Wow what can I say about this desk! FromThe packaging to the desk itself, I‚Äôm so happy with this product. The instructions are so easy to follow and it comes with everything you need! Even came with a sturdy mini screwdriver. I put this whole desk together under an hour and was using it immediately when I was done! I‚Äôm so satisfied with this desk and I‚Äôm glad I found it on Amazon. I often hate going through reviews but if you‚Äôre on the fence about buying.. here‚Äôs your sign to do it!

Overall really good. Has bigger drawers then I thought it would have which is great and is good quality. It took about 3 hours to build. Only problem is it came with a huge crack that went  through half the board that looks like a manufacturing mistake when holes were being made. I hope that wont be an issue in the future since the wood feels strong. But overall still good and worth the price.

Its funny how people try to discourage others with lies or trying to hide their own mistake .This picture here taken from the add clearly said FABRIC DRAWERS !!!!!! So lear how to read.Only problem i had is that the legs could be sturdier

This review has been updated following customer service.I wish the details stating the drawers are fabric wasn't buried in the product description. Other vendors of similar products state this right in the products title, so it would be nice to have this forefront and center. It appears one of the ads photos now does have one stating the drawers are fabric. Presumably following many others shock as we had.That said, following my initial review I was contacted by the seller to address my comments, and they were very accommodating and understanding. I have since updated my rating from 1 star to 3 given they did try anything to make me happy and I felt it was a good idea to let others know.

It was pretty straightforward to assemble. It looks great and my granddaughter loves it. However we were disapppointed in the quality of the drawers. One them came damaged and we are afraid it will get worst with time. Would be great to get a replacement for the damaged drawer.

Looks 100%Features 90%Stability 80%Quality 20%Honestly the material is really cheap bolts are getting bent into the metal upon tightening. Not sure how long it will last cause durability is questionable because of the quality of material.Otherwise, look and features are epic 100%.Shouldn‚Äôt be in the amazons choice list.

Basic desk. Low quality and resistant material. I was hoping more

My daughter really like this desk.  It‚Äôs not too bad for the price,  and is pretty sturdy once it‚Äôs all built.  My only problem is the drawer handles are made of incredibly cheap plastic and they fell apart within the first day.

The cardboards to make the base of the drawers sturdy are missing from my package.

I like the desk however there is no yellow light as shown in the picture. This was the only light I was going to use as the others are very obnoxious, but I was very disappointed as I switched through all the lighting options not to find the nice yellow/orange lighting as pictured.

It came damaged but it took me 1 hour to build it so im not going to return it.  Very disappointed

I find the drawers not very sturdy, not happy with the drawers

Pleased with product for what it is at the price point, But USB C plug does not work. All other‚Äôs work fine ,but this particular one not working is pretty disappointing, that with the led light not being as  bright as advertised gives this a 3. Would be 5.

the wood structure is sturdy, but the draws are OK quality not sturdy enough, for a kid this size and quality is ok, easy to assemble

A little difficult to assemble as the instructions weren‚Äôt easy to see

Êó†Ê≥ïÂä†ËΩΩÂ™í‰Ωì„ÄÇ
                



Okay first off I love it sm the drawers are HUGEEE. Now here‚Äôs one issue that don‚Äôt bother me, 1 drawer is crooked. Now an issue that does bother me is, the part where the power strip goes into wasn‚Äôt cut correctly so i wasn‚Äôt able to screw it in or even push it all the way down. I‚Äôm sure I can fix it w a lil sanding. But otherwise I‚Äôm happy with it. Building was easy took abt 2hrs as a teen girl. Would recommend for short term purpose not something u could have for over like 4 years.

The desk is cute, the colors work, there are different color modes. The only thing I don‚Äôt really like is the storage bins. I thought they were wood. They are not. They are a soft storage bin tote. One is a little bent so it‚Äôs a pain to pull out and put back in. Not bad for price though and is overall pretty sturdy.

My daughter picked out this desk because she liked the LED light strip.  I didn't realize prior to purchase that the drawers are soft canvas.  They're not sturdy.  I didn't love the instructions either as I found them a bit complicated.  I bought 2 different desks for both my kids but the other one was much better quality than this and at a better price.

It took longer than expected to put this together.  The drawers are fabric.  I really don't like that feature but it's my fault I didn't read correctly. It serves its purpose. It's ok for the cost but was expecting something more. Instructions can be confusing so pay attention and double check. Lol. The delivery time came earlier than estimated.

Good desk but a little wobbly. Not enough to worry about, only if you try and shake it. I'd recommend a better wall faster than the one they provided but other than that it's solid enough.They provide little covers for the holes if you don't want to use the extra top shelf which was nice.Not the deepest desk especially with how big monitor stand now days but I was space limited to start with so the desk fits perfectly for me. Just make sure you test out the depth before hand or you may be disappointed. if you use the extra shelf your looking at only around 13.5 inches of space which is why I left it off and can't speak to the quality of that but it looks solid.This was an oversight by me but with the drawers I have to lower my chair all the way to get it under the desk when not in use because of the arms.The storage is much better than expected the fabric draws are actually really nice and work very smooth. As long as you aren't filling them with bricks they should be more than satisfactory for most people.

I bought this desk for my 9 year old daughter and it‚Äôs a great value for the price.It‚Äôs very cute and the light underneath the top is perfect.My only minor complaint would be it‚Äôs not extremely sturdy. However that‚Äôs not a big deal for us because  it‚Äôs not being used for anything other than arts and crafts.Definitely recommend.

This desk is perfect for a small room. Easy to assemble. Love the outlets to plug things in.

Easy to assemble, good sized drawers and I like the plug in feature as well. LED lights are not too bright or too dim. Would definitely recommend

This was a purchase for my daughter as her first desk. She is thrilled and loves that it lights up. I like the small shelf and drawers. It is a good desk overall.

It was an adequate desk for our need. I probably didn't read far enough but was surprised to see the drawers were cloth. Again nothing exciting but adequate and inexpensive.

Good desk overall just wish the drawers were wood and not a fabric material given the price

This product took over a week for delivery but was worth it.  Even though some of the pieces were mislabeled and the instructions were a little disorienting (because it can be assembled twodifferent ways) it only took an hour or so to assemble for 2 people.  The drawers are fabric (think foldable cubby drawer) and the front looks like pleather but isn't horribly noticeable. We're using it as a vanity for our daughter and it has plenty of space; plus the raised section is good for her perfumes and toiletries. It also feels pretty solid.

It's a cute desk for a child or compact living.

The drawers a cloth like material, and the fronts have a leather look.  I got this for my 13 year old daughter to use as a desk and vanity.  I bought the mirror separately.  She seems to really like it.

It is nice but some difficulties to install.

i got the 37 inch desk and it is very satisfactory. the instructions were not very clear and so i put some of the pieces on backwards, and let led to the drawers not going in right. but i made it work. i love the LED lights. it definitely upgrades it. overall it‚Äôs a good desk but you NEED 2/3 people to help you do it. you can definitely not do it by yourself.

This is a good desk. It is not the most stable or heavy desk so be aware if you have need of something more solid this may not be the best option. Putting it together is pretty simple. There is one mistake in the instructions but nothing difficult to work through. It gives you two choices on how to build based on where you want the drawers to be.Overall, it is nice looking, has power outlets and some cool lighting. This is a good size desk and we are pleased with it!

Assembling only took a few hours to build, and was relatively easy to follow. However, the only setback is that some of the building instructions had the wrong number to the corresponding part (ex: Some of parts #9 was actually part #11). Wasn‚Äôt a major problem in the process, but highly advise to modify in the instruction manual. Other than that, I love that the table came out great, is multifunctional, and has ton of storage. Definitely would recommend to anyone that wants to keep a sleek and minimalistic touch to their room.

Finally something easy to assemble! Nice desk for any age. Light enough to move around, yet very sturdy. So happy I purchased this desk! I didn‚Äôt use the lights though. I dislike LEDs.

It was an easy piece of furniture to put together on my own. It‚Äôs not really heavy duty but a nice little work space, and the lights and plug are handy features.

This desk was a gift to be used as a make-up table which had a Hollywood make-up mirror bought for it also. The desk is perfect for a make-up table/ bedroom fixture. The light system and USB charging ports are a great addition.  Easy to put together,easy to follow instructions, came with a few extra parts and tools to put it together. Very very happy üòä

Light weight desk. Great for my daughter‚Äôs vanity. Went together well a few of the pieces were a little bent and one screw whole was not made properly. Otherwise it is good.

Love this one! It took me a while to assemble it all, but the end product was satisfying, especially the LED Lights! Soo good

Serves the purpose. Not for heavy uses.A bit fragile. Ok for price.

The depth in picture is misleading. It is not 18.5 inch + 6.7 inch but only 18.5 inch. The monitor stand is on the 18.5 inch desk.

Good

Sorry to say....I ordered table with BLUE light, they sent me RED light one.

it‚Äôs super cute !! i got the 47inch one in white and i love it ! it‚Äôs smaller than i pictured it to be but that‚Äôs on me for not measuring and everything :)

Very durable desk at a great price. The height is very comfortable to work at. The storage is very sturdy. Easy to use and build.

I love it! I love it! The drawers can go on either side, your choice when putting it together! Hey it!

This desk is so cool. Put together in about an hour. Easy to follow instructions.

Got it for my teenage daughter. She loves it! Sturdy and you can put the drawers on either side when building it. I would recommend.

I had this desk for a while now. The building was some was great. I really enjoyed using it a lot.

Bought this for my daughter for her birthday she loves it!!!!! It was easy to build and came with all the pieces you need. Directions were very easy to understand and I would say this desk is pretty sturdy. The LED lights are super cool! I like the outlets on top of the desk it‚Äôs great for charging your phone or laptop for school. Lots of hours doing homework and school work will be spent on this desk

I spent so much time on Amazon looking for the perfect desk for school- something that was spacious, had drawers, and a USB port. I absolutely love this desk, I‚Äôm happy I chose this one. It doesn‚Äôt take up too much room, and it looks nice. The LED lights were a nice touch, you‚Äôre also able to download an LED app and control the lights on there. Assembly time was less than 2 hours, I was watching a movie at the same time. But overall wasn‚Äôt too hard! I recommend üëç

I really wanted to upgrade from my smaller brown desk without drawers to something that was more of my style and had drawers. This desk is amazing for the price, and the added bells and whistles (lights, outlets, etc.) just makes it so much better! It only took my husband a little under an hour to put it together, so it‚Äôs definitely not complicated to build either.

I ordered this desk as a station for my son. He loves it and it holds all his devices and accessories.Easy to build

Need a desk to keep things out of grandson reach

loved how easy it was to put together it arrived when i was sick and i was still able to put together the desk in less than a half an hour perferct for my needs

If you have an art lover in your life like I do this is perfect gift for them. Has plenty of room for all of her supplies. Very sturdy not worried it's gonna fall apart. Was great price üëç  would definitely buy again and recommend

Super cute desk! My daughter loves it! Wasn't to hard to put together.

Great desk for the price point! No missing pieces and went together easily. Love the lights ‚ú®Ô∏è

I found a desk at home depot that I wanted that was very similar to this one, it was $298. So I was looking for a cheaper option found this. I LOVE this desk even more than the one I found at office depot. The material of the desk is great! The drawers are larger than I expected & hold a lot of weight. I home school & one drawer holds two of my kids full set of school books. The lights, purse rack & outlets that come on the desk are amazing features! That the $298 desk from office depot didn't have! Definitely a great value for the money!

My husband took about 45 to 1 hr to assemble itIt‚Äôs a perfect place to do my makeup and also do my daily walk with God üòäüòäüòäI fell in love üòç

Easy to put together. Has lighting for working at night.

Shipping was fast and very nice just as it looks like in the picture. Was easy to assemble and most of my daughter loved it

The assembly instructions for this desk are the best I‚Äôve ever seen.  The diagrams are clear, all components & hardware are clearly marked.My 10 yr old granddaughter assisted me & she followed the instructions & enjoyed assembling it with me.  It‚Äôs her desk & I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll enjoy using it for many years.  The materials are primarily metal & the drawers are a hardened cardboard that should be fine holding a 3-4 lbs of material each.  I‚Äôd recommend this desk for light to medium use.

My mom loves her new desk has lots of room for her things.

This desk is perfect. Fairly easy to assemble

This is the neatest desk! I needed something on the smaller and inexpensive side for my daughter. This is perfect! Love the depth of the side drawers, the lights are super cool and the built-in charging port is a huge plus!! My husband is pretty handy and it took him about 45 min to assemble. The front of the drawers are like a faux leather. Frame pieces are metal. Lots of desk space for her to draw or put on makeup. Would purchase again. Highly recommend!!!

Let me start off with saying that the drawers included in the table is phenomenal. I can sort space for everything I need and I don't have to go around the house looking for my stuff in other drawers. The light is an added bonus and u can control it through your phone as well, but I don't really use that. One thing I don't really like is that the table is easily wobbly but not wobbly enough to get anything off your desk. It's only if you shake it with a force.

I needed a new makeup vanity for my bedroom. We don't have tons of room because our bedroom set is pretty bulky and I'm super limited on how we can configure the furniture. This works perfectly in space. Not super deep which gives me more space to walk between it and the bed; however deep enough to put a mirror on the monitor shelf and have plenty of desk space for other items. The drawers are much deeper than the old desk I had which gives me more options storage. This desk was really simple to put together with easily read instructions, and only took me about 45 min start to finish.

I want to start off by saying that I was originally intimated before assembling this desk, given that I'd never built anything in my life, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the set the instructions were, as well as how simple the parts were labeled. This desk allows you two ways to set it up; build A has instructions for those who want the fabric drawers on the left, and build B has instructions for those who want the fabric drawers on the right. There is one mistake in the instruction manual however. I did build A and in step 11 it's instructed to screw in #9 when it's supposed to be #11, and the same is true for build B on step 36; it wasn't a big deal to me since I had already read the reviews that mentioned this. Overall, I am super pleased with both the quality of this desk, as well as how satisfying it was to build and how affordable it was. 10 out of 10!

Great size, very sturdy. Went together very well. Even included the screw driver and allen wrench that was needed. From unbox to put together took me about an hour.

Easy to assemble, I needed a small desk but this is smaller than I thought I should've looked at the size but it was still pretty good it fit where I wanted it. The lights work and it's very sturdy.

Very good quality product. packaged well. Included extra hardware which is a pleasant change from the usual missing hardware when you buy something elsewhere. Instructions were very good.

I never put together anything by myself before, so this desk was my first, and it was extremely easy. Took some time to get it built but wasn‚Äôt hard at all. Desk is sturdy enough, (might be slightly wobbly but nothing too bad, as long as you‚Äôre not rough with it) and the RGB lights are a nice addition, along with the extra outlets. The drawers aren‚Äôt the best thing in the world but they get the job done. Perfect desk for the price, would highly recommend to anyone needing a small desk

I'm using it as my makeup station. The drawers are lightweight, easy to open. Love the lights and the color choices! Also love the plug ins, that helped so much! It wasn't hard to put together, just follow instructions, my husband helped me. No problems at all

When you open it you will see alot of pieces. But everything is clearly labeled with great instructions. Very simple to put together. Came out great. LED lights are really cool. Controlled by an app or the switch on the desk. The outlets on the desk are very convenient too. Just what I wanted. I just wanted a simple desk with drawers for gaming. A place to put my gaming monitor.

Very well deserved product

Easy assembly, sturdy and great value for the money. Packaging was surprisingly good, each piece was wrapped separately. Great for a small space with plenty of storage.

It's very easy to install as long as you follow the instructions and it only took about 2 hours. There's tons of storage space and the led light and plug ins add a great touch. I use my desk as a vanity and computer desk.  I needed a space for my pink iMac in a small apartment and this fits so perfect.

I like it. I was looking for a smaller desk. The drawers are not large enough for file folders and they are fabric drawers so they cannot hold a lot of heavy stuff. That is my only dislike. I thought I would at least be able to lay file folders flat.It was easy to assemble. Just pay attention to the directions.

I ordered this desk for more room for my monitors. When I got the box and was putting together I found the actual desk top part had been damaged so I contacted seventable and sent them a picture of the damage and they sent me a completely new box, didn't ask me to return the first one, second time around everything was good all the parts were good to use. I appreciate their customer service and willingness to fix the problem for. I would recommend them to anyone. Great job, thanks Seventable.

Gave it to my granddaughter for her birthday she loves it

I like that it is just the right sizeFor the space I had available, it was easy to assemble and all the parts were correct and in order

Perfect for my daughter‚Äôs space. Was very easy to assemble. Clear directions and came with extra screws/bolts.

Love this desk. 47 inches wide with roomy drawers

Desk had dings throughout , looked used end had multiple scratches. Shipping box was in good condition but the desk itself was not what I expected.

There was parts missing from the box . A piece of the board was broken! I wasn‚Äôt pleased with it at all

The desk is pretty well thought out. Even comes with brass pieces pre-installed for ease of assembly. During assembly when I screwed piece #15 into the bottom of the desk top into the receiving hole, it just kept spinning the pre-installed brass fitting causing it to bore out of the bottom of the desk so the two could not connect. Fortunately I‚Äôm extremely handy and had industrial strength epoxy on hand so I was able to fix it. The desk is sturdy and looks nice. It will serve its purpose.Also this desk didn‚Äôt come with any LED light strips as per the description and instructions. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed about this.

Instructions are by photo - a lot of bags of different screws and bolts poorly identified, boards are poorly identified, only drawings to go by, no warning that side tableand shelf is unstable

Love this desk, but once I was almost finished putting it together I realized they sent me the wrong rails for the drawers.They are labelled ‚Äú21 & 22‚Äù and there should be 3 of each. But instead I got 5 21‚Äôs and 1 22. Which means I can‚Äôt even use the drawers‚Ä¶Will update when this is solved.

It‚Äôs definitely not worth what you pay for it. Very cheap materials. Amazon is turning into Wish.com.

While it is sturdy, a lot of the pieces do not line up well. The metal foundations cannot match up.  The top boards if lined up perfectly doesn't fit the screws. Once the screws are in you'll find it slanted a bit. You get what you paid for.

Only issue is just nothing lines up. They last quite awhile and are sturdy but putting them together is a bit of a nightmare. Screw holes or in the instructions it's not clear enough on which side is pointing out or not.

It‚Äôs a great desk overall and the metal legs and solid engineered wooden surfaces feel sturdy. It‚Äôs got great shelf space and doesn't feel cheaply made.Some minor annoyance came when setting it up. Screws are in difficult areas that only allow you to turn them a quarter of a turn with the tools they provide. So it takes some time to assemble. It took me about 2 hours to set the whole thing up.The size is a little bit smaller than what the picture shows. Make sure to measure out using their provided dimensions. I thought it be a little bit bigger, but the size is okay for what I need it for.LED‚Äôs are a nice touch too and are well made. The provider is LotusLantern and same goes for the app.Overall I really like the desk and it‚Äôs perfect for a nice corner cubby or small space.

what how it says to put it together pay close attention to the instructions. only thing I didnt like was where the plug in is on the desk and that the top that can sit a tv on is not wide enough in my opinion my dons tv legs do hang a tad off the front and back but he is old enough to know not to shake the desk but that is person preference i guess that is why i gave it a 4..... over all great sturdy desk!

I love this desk not the sturdiest desk but very good option for the price the instructions were not very clear but it took attest 1 hour to put it all together but overall I am in love with this desk and it's perfect for a gaming desk

The desk is solid, table, and looks great. Not quite as big as it looks on the pictures though. The rgb LEDs are decent and the associated app is fine, but they sometimes randomly glitch out and change to colors you didn‚Äôt initially set them to.

Great desk for the price!

Instructions on item were not so clear which made it take a LOT longer for assembly. Also, I recommend NOT using any power tools. The desk overall is nice and also sturdy.

I bought this desk for my son. It was well labeled for assembly and put together pretty easy. I love the shelves, fabric drawers and led lights. All in all a great desk for the price.

Directions where kind of confusing because the pieces changed but for the most part easy to follow directions and assembly

Likes:Instructions are very clear.Has extra screws of every type, just in case!Every piece is labelled.Instructions are laid out in a way that it can be put together by one person.Looks like the photo when finished.The adhesive on the back of the LED is very good, and attaches very smoothly.  The LED also has a nice clear plastic covering to protect the lights.Everything lined up nicely after assembly.Dislikes:The picture shows more LED strips than you actually get.  The picture shows 3, when it comes with 2.It would be nice to have an optional keyboard tray.  It could attach underneath like some of the other pieces do.Mixed:I like that it's light and easy to move around, but it could also be easily damaged because of that.  I would have be gentle with it, and take it apart, if I wanted to move it to another house.The fabric drawers are better quality than what you'd find at a dollar store, but they'll still be difficult to clean.  The rigidity comes from cardboard in the fabric, so I can't wash them.  I like how easily they came together.Overall: We're happy with it!

I needed a desk for working from home but didn't want to spend a fortune on a solid wood one. I liked that this one had all the features I was looking for in a desk, but without all the added cost, and the lights were just a bonus. The desk went together very easily and the instructions were very clear. I built it by myself and it took me a couple of hours but I wasn't trying to rush it. It feels very solid. No pieces came damaged, and there were extra screws for each type. The drawers are surprisingly sturdy for cloth drawers as well.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars (and really, it would be a 4.5 if I could give half stars) is for the LED lights. The instructions were very very minimal and I had to figured out a few things on my own. After installation, I realized that putting the lights on the taller section was a terrible idea because they are in your eyes if you are sitting at the desk. I will need to add some kind of cover in order to use them. My other issue is with the colors. There is no true white or true yellow. The white is light blue and the yellow is a pale green. The images for the desk show a very sunshine yellow which is the color I was hoping to use but it's not possible to get that color even with the app. And my final gripe with the lights is that all of the cords and the controller are black. Considering white cords exist, you'd think they would provide a white cord/light option with a white desk.So overall I am very impressed with the desk but not super happy with the LED's.

I read a handful of reviews before I ordered this desk for my 11yr old daughter.I feel it is a great value for under $200.Metal frame, decent hardware, & probably the best instruction manual I've ever seen.  It took me 3.5 hrs to assemble, but I was taking my time.The tools they provided worked, but I'd recommend a proper Allen Key set, (a ratchet with an Allen key would have been perfect.  There were alot to screws. )The lighting feature suggests a phone app to have extra control over the lights, but it will work just fine without an app.The drawers are a bit silly, but for a kid, I guess they'll work.  Having the electrical outlets and charging ability right on the work space is a smart idea, but they could have placed it back a few inches in the design.  Adjustable feet are a plus.  Overall, I'm impressed for what it is.  I'll say it again, the instructions were very well thought out.  Happy Dad here.

Easy to assemble, son loves the multi levels and the strip lighting. Just unsure who long the fabric shelving will last as he will overload  them with stuff. Time will tell!

Good:- Easy to follow instructions and assemble.- Good quality of LED strip. (Not the top of the line, but good density)- Feels stable and strong.- Main power cable is of good quality.Bad:- Fingerprint/handprint magnet- I bought a dark one, it easily shows dust.- It has 2 USB A ports and one of them is already occupied by its LED light.- The plugs are close to each other, might be problematic to some of the pairs.- USB C is only 5V, come on Seventable, it is 2024!- One of the drawers slides out, around 1 cm.- One of the screws was broken, but they had provided extra screws, so it is fine.- Could have provided better cable management solution such as hanging net or something.

Love the desk but the lights are glitching!! Maybe faulty set

Use your own screwdriver when assembling, the one that comes in is very weak and the handle will start turning without tightening the screw.Took me a bit to set up but thats subjective.If you take your time and make sure everything is tight and set up correctly this desk is beautiful, plug ins work, LED lights come with an app (it's a bit janky)Keep in mind the top shelf is only 6.7 inches, that might not fit all monitors, my monitor has slight overhang but it's acceptable, cannot fit a 15.6" laptop on the long side, must be put into corner for the most stability.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, though, I'm sure taking it apart will NOT be fun at all when that day comes üôÉLots and lots and lots of screws

Pros: Affordable, rigid, plenty of space, good lighting, tons of storage, decent drawers, overall nice design.Cons: Supports can get in the way, one piece came flawedOverall, I am very pleased with the desk. It does what I need it to do, and it looks terrific. My only gripe is that one of the main pieces came flawed. I built it anyways because I needed it, but the instructions tell you to contact them via their email to replace any broken pieces for free. Contacted the company half way through building it, and they got back to me before it was even finished, so customer support is aces! Instructions are also very clear, and you actually get a few spare pieces for screws and whatnot in case you lose some.Overall pleased, and will likely change this to 5 stars once the fixed piece is delivered!

I love my new desk! Took my husband only like 2-3 hours to assemble with the help of the kids. Instructions are clear, easy to read and figure out what goes where and what is what. It feels sturdy enough, no wobbling or shaking. The drawers are held tight and ergonomics are good. The only thing....it came in with a board cracked. Hubby told me it would still hold up as there are metal supports across said board and they will take the weight, not the board itself. Luckily the defect is only visible from under the desk.

Nice table so far easy to build shipped fastFollow instructions and you will be fine ,  also use a drill it will make your life much easier.One thing I wish it had was a area to hold the computer tower as the desk it‚Äôs self isn‚Äôt very wide and doesn‚Äôt have a great location to hold a large tower so it ends up on the floor which Isn‚Äôt the end of the world to meOver all very happy with my purchase

I love this desk. I love that  how big it is and the shelves It's very sturdy and comes with supplies to attach to the wall. On the other hand this is nearly impossible to understand how to build the instructions where.Very difficult to understand and It took like 3 hours to build.

Very nice desk. Follow directions & you won‚Äôt have a problem. Finished product just a described!

The keyboard and screen are a little too high

So first off the page mention its easy to assemble, that is true if you don't use the included screwdriver, use your own tools as the one thats included is difficult to use, took me a little over an hour to put it together.After its assembled first off all there are quite a few RGB strips with this desk, the design is very modern and provided you tightened all the supports correctly its very sturdy, it would be a perfect streamer/gamer setup with its built in charging station which allows you to cable manage with your setup , it has a few drawers for storage which is very handy, I wasn't a fan of the higher shelves because the monitor we were using which is a TV didn't quite fit in there properly we had to use the other side of the desk, because of the L-shape design we set it off in the corner, definitely recommend to anyone just looking to start a fresh streaming/gaming setup.

I got this desk because the design is exactly what I needed. I do nails and some of the nail table were not what I was looking for. I was second guessing getting it but I am happy I did. It‚Äôs very good quality for the price which is surprising. It‚Äôs not extremely big like I thought either. It didn‚Äôt take more than an hour to put together either. They also include all of the tools you need to get it done too. And it aligns very well too. It‚Äôs not super heavy so it‚Äôs easy to move around. It‚Äôs also very sturdy and has adjustable feet too so it‚Äôs not unleveled either and the black looks great in any setup! 10 of 10 recommend!

This desk arrived 2 days early.  When I opened up the box, I found all the parts were neatly and securely packaged.  There was NO damage or missing parts.  The instruction booklet is perfectly written in easy-to-read English with lots of extra notes.  The assembly went very easy and took me a couple hours.  The quality is excellent and if I needed to buy another one, I would certainly get this one.  Excellent quality.

Considering all the elements the desk includes, it was an easy assemble. It took us about 45 minutes to an hour to get it completely set up. It fit our small office well and is comfortable for day to day use. The only downside was that it came with some chipped parts that are pretty evident when seated but other than that, impressed with the quality and functionality of this for the price!

If you are thinking about getting this desk this is what you need to know. I chose to set up my desk the way it is set up in the image, with the overhead on the left.They recommended two people to put the desk together but I did it by myself. The instruction manual is very clear and easy to understand, since I did put the desk together by myself it took about 6 hours. The desk does come with a screwdriver and two Allen wrenches, however, I bought a Small Power Electric Screwdriver Set. https://a.co/d/ef5WOup Using this made everything so much easier and faster. It would have taken longer If I didn't buy the Electric Screwdriver. The desk is super sturdy, especially for the price, I love this desk. If I could change one thing it would be the leg room, if you have a normal computer chair or a non-reclining gaming computer chair then there will be enough space for you but if you DO have a reclining computer chair then you won't have the under desk room like you want sadly. To be honest that is my only complaint I love, love love this desk! I can't wait to decorate it some more!

Bought this for my grandson and he loves it.Fairly easy to assemble and looks great.  He loves the lights and it even has a power outlet on it.

Fits well, I was scared at first that it wasn't gonna fit but it work pretty well. There is alot space to put my collection of firgures. The led light gives it a nice touch.Would recommend for anyone that has a small room and very easy to build.

First price, good quality, kinda hard to assemble, but fantastic result.

The table came with no damages and easy to put together! My Fiancee love it!  However, People needs to know that you do not need to over tighten the screws! doing so will just break the hole and probably ruin putting stuff together. That's the only Cons I can say about this. Be careful and take your time!

Excellent! Very Good.

Very nice sturdy desk with a lot of room to store things fits 3 27 inch monitors

1000/10. Compact yet spacious, looks modern and chic. Assembly wasn‚Äôt super hard but it takes hours for people who usually don‚Äôt build furniture üòÖ my little brother wants one in black

Easy to build

The desk is perfect for the space we have. Easy to assemble and feels sturdy. Great customer service as well. The box had one incorrect part inside which prevented a complete assembly. Customer Service found the correct part would take too long to ship to me so they took the more expensive route and found a solution so I could have the part in 2 days instead of waiting weeks to be able to use the desk. Very satisfied.

Table fits great in my small living room! The only hassle was building it took a while but other than that I love it so far! The lights really adds the dynamic gaming feel to it. I recommend this a 2 person job. I had my friend help me build it.

Having built many many pieces of furniture this desk was a blessing.  It came with every piece individually wrapped and protected, the material was light but strong with metal reinforced bolt holes, and the instructions were broken down in a way that you could pick the configuration you desired, flip to that section and follow simple instructions.  This is also the only piece of furniture I've ever assembled where the parts where numbered in the order they go together.  Very happy customer!

Great desk for the price. Had everything my son wanted for a gaming desk. It did take some time to put together but all the pieces were there and good instructions.

It‚Äôs a bit smaller than I thought based on the measurements but i‚Äôm still super impressed. it‚Äôs spacious and sturdy. The legs are metal. Took my husband a bit of 2 hours to put it together I haven‚Äôt tried the LED lights thought

For a product for short time use. It‚Äôs great. It was easy to carry upstairs. It‚Äôs durable enough to hold what is needed and it does take up much space. If you are looking for something hefty, this isn‚Äôt the product. But it is great if your budget or moving into a dorm.

It‚Äôs sturdy. Worth the price

Took forever assembleing but love it now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been done

My son really likes this desk . Excellent customer service. Thank you we definitely recommend you guys.

Took a while to build ‚Ä¶ and figure out.Love the LED and the power strip!!!!‚Ä¶ exactly what I needed.

This is a very good desk for the price, large and stable lots of storage space aswell

Everything I was expecting.

I got this for my work from home desk and I love it so so much. The space is more than enough for 2 big monitors and it is very sturdy. Fixing it was not so easy as I did it all alone. But I must admit, the user manual was so so comprehensive. Just follow the guide it will be easy to set up. Thanks to the manufacturers! KUDOS to whoever put the manual together, I love my desk.

I am very surprised by how well this desk was packaged and the details in the instructions. 100x better building experience than any IKEA furniture I have built. Extra screws were included just in case, everything went together with no issues, and the desk feels incredibly sturdy. I wasn't sure about this desk when buying it as it had no reviews and appeared to be a new seller but they deserve seriously deserve this review.This is a great upgrade for my gaming/streaming setup. The lights are a nice touch with a button system for those who don't want to download the app. I am loving the lights and how easy they were to "install"This desk is definitely worth the money

The desk was easy to assemble even though It took 2 days, but The LED lights are amazing, and the desk itself is perfect for my needs and style

My 11 year old wanted this for his birthday. I was hesitant about buying what seemed to be a cheap desk on Amazon but it's actually really great!Took me awhile to assemble it and also put it together backwards, I swear the instructions for the direction I wanted it to go were not correct!He loves the desk and its shelves and lights. I like that it's a sturdy piece.

I've been searching for a desk for a really long time & im so glad I decided to get this one!The instructions were very easy, it took me a long time to build it but that's because I have a non-existent attention span lolI love that it's customizable! It fit perfectly in my corner. The lights are really cool & also customizable. It came with everything it needed to put it together & also came with extra hardware which was really nice!Very happy with my purchase!

GREAT DESK, LOOKS GOOD AND FITS WITH MY DECOR...

Great quality for the price I was pleasantly surprised. Fairly easy to put together tho took me about 1-2 hours alone. Overall very impressive for the price

It took me whole day to build it but actually really worth it in the end and I have so much more space now

Fast shipping, It take 2 hours to build. Box is heavy. Great for the price and very solid. I am very happy.

Almost easily assembled some parts didn‚Äôt show clearly what was the front but still a great desk!

My son loves his desk. I love that it's not noisy like his old desk. Our living space is under his room and the old desk drove us crazy. This one is beautiful and esthetic

Nice, but takes time and effort to assemble.

Nice cozy good quality.  Light and power bar includedabout 3h to assemble

Took me awhile to finally decide to purchase this desk. So glad I did. I love that I could have it go in either L formation to suit the room. I gave up waiting on my husband to build it and did it myself. Super easy and clear instructions. Everything was labeled. And it took approximately 2.5 hours. Probably could‚Äôve been quicker but I watched a movie while I did it. I love love love how it came out. Can‚Äôt recommend this desk enough. So happy I purchased it! Great quality. So many great additions like the hook for the ear phones and the charging plate. Super Sturdy.

This desk was an amazing replacement for my older one, as I didn‚Äôt have room for both my desktop and drawing tablet to use at the same time, I was a little worried it was gonna be wobbly but after it was built and my stuff was on it, it‚Äôs not that badInstructions were a little funky, but with patience it‚Äôs easy to figure out

I put this together by myself. It took a while, but it was straight forward. The desk feels really solid. I tried the outlets, they all work except for the USBC, but I think it is because of my phone. I'll be checking. The LED lights work fine,  I'm not using the app that control them as I downloaded it and my phone translated the languagw to English and it didn't make sense. Everything was packaged well and nothing appeared damaged. The tools included were great, there was even a mini screw driver.The drawers are folding fabric ones, but they feel quite sturdy and strong

It will take you 4 hours to build and some carpel tunnel will develop but overall you can‚Äôt beat the price for the quality.Picture advertises 3 led strips however the desk only comes with two for the lower portion.

Worthit. They know what they are doing

Was super easy to assemble and the first brand who had instructions that were only images and I could actually follow it along properly. You can also assemble it the opposite way, super great for the price and sturdy too. Came within a week! Would recommend

I purchased 2 of these desks for my fiance and I. We just started a gaming room. The desk are exactly what we wanted however the 1 str rating is because the type - c port does not work. This is the cord I use to charge my head set and controller. Not worth returning or selling for a less value after putting the work in to assemble 2 of them.

Product came damaged on one of the c√≥rneasNot a good quality material, I hope I get some money reimbursed, don't want to go to the trouble of putting it back on the box.  But the seller should be on my list  of don't buy anything from them again üòí

This desk while I was very hopeful was not very sturdy. I have a gaming setup with 2 monitors  the desk seem to start bowing to the weight of them. When building the desk we couldn't get the cross bars on because there was no physical way to line them up with holes due to them being short by a couple inches. The also put stoppers for the drawers on both sides causing us not to be able to get the drawers in. If this desk was for a student with a laptop it might be a better choice but not for a gaming setup.

This was a poor quality desk. The plastic broke when I tried to screw it. It fell when I turned it and broke. I threw it in the garbage. First thing I‚Äôve ever bought online that was a total disappointment

Product shipped fast, however arrived with several broken parts

The guide holes that were drilled into the wood are inaccurate to the point that I‚Äôd have to make all new guide holes a quarter inch off. Made it impossible to put this thing together. Other holes were slightly off in the metal, not a big deal, but the wood ones were horrible. Now I have to put this thing with 50 parts back in the box to return. Horrible experience.

Arrived with a broken weld on the center desktop support rail.

The metal frame was bent out of the box and other parts of the desk were scratched‚Ä¶ DO NOT BUY

The product showed up damaged

1st I want to say that when I ordered it it never got delivered and got a replacement which was still late but I got it and when I started putting it together a few of the metal pieces were bent. Honestly I do not recommend this table.

Never opened the box. They don‚Äôt even give you 30 days to return. But I moved and it would t fit in the space. What a bummer.

Came with 2 of the metal pieces bent. They would not send replacement parts. Only options were to return or exchange it. Tried to bend them back and make it work but it doesn't look great. Not a high quality desk.

Horrible quality, even for the low price. Fabric drawers broke in less than an hour. Wobbly and bent legs. Do not purchase this.Thankful for good Amazon customer service rep who returned/refunded us.

I am missing two parts of the desk

This is a real piece of junk.1. Very difficult to assemble2. Not sturdy at all3. Very small4. The drawers constantly fall off (not user error)

Very unstable product and the lights do not last long. Avoid if possible

Not sturdy.Came.damaged anwithout a part also.Put the thing together and then realized it's missing...Frustrating!Drawers don't fit it the slots.

It‚Äôs a beautiful looking desk but it‚Äôs quality is horrible save your money find something better‚Ä¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Itge quality is awful how can you deliver something like this ?

Very cheap table! Bad quality! Not worth at all!!!

Totally disappointed. The product they sent me was defective. The base of the table was not stable, and the legs kept moving all the time. It was completely unusable. I am wondering how it passed through the seller's quality assurance process. I had to deal with the hassle of returning it. Any customer will face the same issue if they receive an unstable table base.

We have requested for a part replacement online on the website of the seller and we have not received any response yet.We are waiting for the response so that we can decide whether to keep or replace or return.We will like to have full refund as messaged received by the seller. If they are not willing to deliver the parts on time

This is the most complicated table setup I have dne in my life. The instructions are wrong and I had to open all the screws to fix it. I cannot waste my time again to build it up. I am returning it back.

Desk is too small than the image. The drawers do not sit properly.

Bought based on the reviews and made it to step two of the instructions. Every single weld was broken. So badly made.

It‚Äôs missing so many crucial pieces and holes (idk how else to describe it) that‚Äôs crucial to build the desk. It‚Äôs not manufactured properly at all, and I can‚Äôt just shove a screw into the metal beams to make another hole in order to build this table

Could not mount desk top to frame because it was so warped.  Should have figured when step 3 of assembly was to put the shelves to the side of the frame and even those didn't line up properly.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!  Save yourself the trouble of returning back to Canada Post.

It not like an IKEA product. Not sturdy and difficult to assemble. Guess you get what you pay for. I thought the desk top was actually the side boards but it doesn‚Äôt have sideboards. That‚Äôs how cheap it looks. And instructions are wrong and hard to follow. Would not recommend.

The product arrived missing some vital pieces and the Rolanstar support website does not respond. So I have a desk missing the shelves on the side that needs to be propped up by an ikea shelf.

It's pricy for the very poor quality of the product. The pictures are way better than reality. The material is overall thin and cheap. It's not a good deal, I do not recommend.

The table is very unstable, cheap drawers, not worth it.

Not value for money

I have assembled more than my fair share of furniture, but this was a real pain to assemble!

Really sad about this package. The desk was arrived is damaged‚Ä¶

Very disappointing after spending hours of putting that desk together it showed a crack within a few weeks. find a better product.

Product seem very light and loose even after screw tighten

This desk has poor quality finishes and the drawers can be shoved all the way back and drop any drawer contents.

First of all, this thing is cheap.  There are no buts about it.  Then again, this is like one hundredish dollars on Amazon, so what does one expect?Furthermore, the addition of drawers - while nice - limits leg space.  I'm a grown man, about 5'11" and I just can't get comfortable using this desk.  While my legs do fit under the desk, I cannot hold a controller in my lap without my hands bumping into the underside of the desk - there's just not enough clearance.And the other problem is the computer bay.  First of all, it barely holds my mid-sized chassis - with zero room to spare.  Second of all, because the bay is off the side of the desk - left side in my instance - I have to sit and place my legs to the right to fit under the desk.  This means if you have a centrally placed monitor - like I do - you will always be sitting off center, which is brutally annoying.  I was unable to slide the monitor to the right because at 32" with two desktop speakers, I had no room to do so.  It was so annoying I threw this desk in my basement to collect dust and bought something else so I could sit dead center.

I know what you‚Äôll think, it‚Äôs cheap of course there will be issues. First of all I want to say it‚Äôs a beautiful table with a great addition of outlets and led lights. Assembly was easy, it took about an hour to assemble alone. I first noticed that there was a bug literally in the wood, as seen in the photos. While unpacking the parts, I noticed bugs falling out of the packaging and individually wrapped parts. Live. Bugs. Bugs don‚Äôt freak me out so I handled it and disinfected the whole table once assembled. But if you‚Äôre squeamish with bugs, it‚Äôs a risk. I haven‚Äôt seen any other review with this problem. Product is amazing, however the quality might seem cheap. It‚Äôs a comfortable desk with a lot of desk room. Seems stable? It does wobble depending on how you assemble. I had no issues with the screws.

The desk itself is easy to assemble, looks good and my boy loves the LED lights. The desk is ruined, however, by the drawers. They are basically fabric inserts. They are flimsy and there is no structure beneath them to hold them in place. You can't pull them out because when you push them back in they just fall through the bottom of the desk. They're utterly useless. What good is a desk with no drawers?

First off it is nice looking at the very end minus the dressers. Two stars because the dressers are useless, cheap, and just off. The way they have you construct it is even cheaper. Tell me why it‚Äôs a string like material, keeping them from falling forward, but nothing keeping them from falling back or out of the actual dresser.Price should be lowered by $20 just for the ridiculousness involving the dressers.Other than that, I can say that the overall construction of it could be more efficient. It‚Äôs very time-consuming due to the little screw driver they give up t. I would‚Äôve preferred just to all screwdriver bolt situation where I could easily power through with my power drill.

The drawers are cheaply made. They aren‚Äôt wooden they are made of cheap stiff fabric.The hight also seems like it is taller than a standard height. Would spend money on another desk before I bought this one again.

The material used is of extremely poor quality. There needs to be better quality material.

Too frail. Broke during assembly. Very wobbky. Wrong parts sent. Had to make my own.

It‚Äôs okay kinda small but the plug in don‚Äôt work for charging that was one of my reasons for picking this .

I absolutely love the desk but they really sent cloth drawers that fall out with the slightest bump...see video

Damages aside its a functional light duty desk for my youngest (12). He loves the lights and now wants homework.  The work surface  is too small (depth-wise) for my senior high schooler and I don‚Äôt think the desk could withstand the weight of multiple screens or a desktop

Thought this would be a good desk for my son. Very disappointed. The ‚Äúdrawers‚Äù are cheap cloth baskets. They do not stay in place, they are totally uneven, and they fall out the bottom unless perfectly balanced in place. I had to cut a large cardboard sheet (see photos) just to keep the drawers from falling out. Should have gone to that Swedish box store that starts with I and ends with KEA to get something better quality for about the same price.UPDATE: the seller reached out to me following my review and I have to say I was very impressed by the courtesy and concern they showed.  While I stand by my critique of the product and the lack of functioning drawers, I also feel the customer service was excellent and I have revised my rating to two stars.  If they can sort out the issue with the drawers, this could become a great budget-friendly option.

The edges have started showing a strange wear, exposing the cheap material underneath, ruining the whole effect of the setup feeling fancy.

Looks better in pictureDrawers are made of cardboardNot a good value for the money

The drawers are not functional for storage- not very satisfied with product quality

terrible quality, weak product

It's a neat modular cheap table, perfect for a 3d printing setup, though I'm adding more to mine. The problem with this table is holes in the wrong spot or no holes at all. For me it was easy, put parts side by side to put holes in correct spot using marker and drill with drill bit.The one photo I added shows you all you need to know, both 12s should be the same but they are not. That's what you should expect. It's a nice table but needs some extra work to put together, panels are the cheap osb wood but that's to be expected for the price.

Easily put together upside down.  Center piece was put together upside and didn‚Äôt realize until putting in the drawers at the end.  So maddening and needs to be taken mostly apart to fix.  Probably not buy again.  So so sturdy also chair opening could be higher up, legs longer

A very good desk, complicated to put together however please be careful, mine came broken and unfortunately I couldn't return it due to personal timeline issues so I fixed it but don't hesitate to return it and try again if yours comes broken.

This is a nice little desk but the drawers are worthless.  They are canvas and there os NOTHING to hold them in place.  If you put even a piece of paper and a pencil in the drawer  it can not hold it. I  Like the lighting and the shelf behind the computer.  2 SMALL shelfs at least don't fall off everytime you touch them.  I would have paid more to have real  drawers because it is a nice layout.  So if need draewer space do not buy this design

Easy to build. It‚Äôs cute and practical but unfortunately it came with A LOT of cosmetic damages. All the wood pieces were either chipped or had weird splotches on them.

The desk was difficult to put together, & shaky at best. I wish I had spent more & got a better desk

Sizeable desk and thought it looked cool for the price.  Didn't have really high expectations for this, but it fell short of even that.It arrived mildly damaged with chips in the black paint revealing the wood in a few spots.  Seemed unnecessarily difficult to assemble as many screws seemed to be in tight places for no reason.  One of the straps to prevent drawers from falling out ripped on its first go.  The "adjustable height" of the shelf was still too short at its highest setting for my tower, so I opted to take out the shelf.  The whole assembly makes me incredibly nervous with my monitor wobbling back and forth.  Buying stabilizing straps as a solution because returning the desk would be such a hassle.

For the price the desk is ok. Was easy to put together. It came from the manufacturer bent in the frame on the right side, the drawer still works because they are fabric.

This desk was simple enough for my teenage son to assemble. Love the led light feature and color that matched my decor. Not the strongest. Fabric draws are okay but not as sturdy as I would have liked. Still comfortable with my selection.

Desk looks exactly as pictured. Assembly was not too difficult, just time consuming. The embedded outlets started going out one by one after 1 day.

Overall satisfied with the desk. The drawers are awful. I would not recommend this desk until they improve the drawers.

Sooooooo, I guess I didn't read the whole description because I do love the desk the only thing that I failed to realized is that the drawers is not wood but more so of an organizer type of cloth/bin and so when u push in the drawers to much it will fall under it doesn't have no support to it... If u put something heavy it'll fall... We added like a thin wood so it won't have that problem.. I really wish I read the description instead of just seeing how nice it was that's what caught my eye and I didn't pay attention..and I didn't want to return it because my son was excited for his new upgrade so pay attention and read the full description!!!!!!

It's an OK desk. The metal framing makes it sturdy, although the frame I got was crooked and made assembly difficult. There are some screws that were given up on because they just would not go in all the way. It's laminated particle board and there were a few chips, but they were all on places that eventually were hidden. It's a very narrow desk, so be aware of that measurement if you're considering buying. I was only concerned with the length and never thought twice about checking the width. I'm a little too close to my monitor for comfort. The cloth drawers are sturdier than I expected. The cord is generous on the outlet. I opted to not install the LED lights.

I was building it but it came without the led lights the thing that made me want to but this desk was the led light so without them I'm disappointed

The desk is ok, but I didn‚Äôt realize the drawers are cloth material.

Top was cracked in shipping and the drawers are made of fabric and flimsy

Arrived pretty heavily damaged. Now having to lug this to ups in order to get a new one. Save your money

The desktop was damaged in shipping. Other than that, product is as expected.

Decent quality desk. Top shelf /main shelf. 2 bottom side shelves. 3 cloth drawers. Usb charger and 2 outlets. Lightweight but sturdy. LED lighting. Minimalist desk. Easy assembly. It took 2 hours, but I wasn‚Äôt in a hurry.

Bought for my son , who loves the desk however it cheaply made especially the draws which are fabric & do not move freely - the lights work great , desk itself it sturdy -My son loves it or I would have returned because of the drawers ‚Äî

3 fabric drawers basically useless - not adequately supported so they tend to fall down or out (going to try piece of thin wood under them to see if that stablizes.  Light bar ONLY has bright coloured lights - not good for studying (one light choice is a somewhat 'blue' hue - others bright colours).

the desk over all is nice for what I need it for however, the # 10 parts that stabilize the desk are too short. Like someone else‚Äôs comment they had the same issue.  I contacted the company and they are telling me they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not impressed especially since this isn‚Äôt the first desk to have this issue.  The least they can do is send me the right parts and I won‚Äôt comment on the chip off the front of the table part of the desk‚Ä¶

I like the texture of the wood however the drawers kept on falling from its frame. I had to place a board underneath.

Pretty disappointed as the main desk part of the table has visible parts where they didn‚Äôt paint it fully and there is even an air bubble in the paint and it looks horrible. Being a perfectionist does bother me, since this is supposed to be brand new? How does it come with scuff marks and weird discolored parts and air bubbles. It‚Äôs a nice desk it‚Äôs just frustrating when things aren‚Äôt done properly in manufacturing.

The ‚Äúdrawers‚Äù are made of cloth and are really unstable. I doubt they‚Äôll actually support anything more than a couple of pounds. Not sure how I feel about this overall. I guess time will tell.

The desk looks wonderful, however was not completely finished as the #10 pieces (2of them) which stabilizes the desk did not fit.  It was too short.  The company has promised to send the corrected replacement but it will be a month or more before we receive it, if it does come.  I‚Äôm a little concerned here because if it never reaches us, the return period will also be void as it will be over a month.

Too tall to be a desk but did good with as a TV stand. Keep in mind this product is long but very thin, if you buying for gaming fo not, my mouse keeps hitting the end of the desk but either way it is a good product..

Made in China, instructions unclear, gotta take apart and rebuild so the drawers are usable

I love this desk, but I hate the drawers. They always fall out in for this my husband had to put a piece of wood up under each of them so this issue wouldn‚Äôt keep occurring.

It‚Äôs cheap and feels like it.It does not over promise or anything but it gets the job done

The kids love the lights, I dont like the drawers they are cloth like material, otherwise it works great for what we needed it for

USB C doesn‚Äôt work but the 2 power outlets and the usb does. Kinda disappointed the C doesn‚Äôt work . LED lights work good.

This is cute table and I like itBut only complain is that the drawers made with cloth is quite delicate. It falls off every time I try to put it to put something in. If the manufacturer makes the strong storage space/ drawers then this is perfect

Quality of wood doesn‚Äôt seem to be that great. However, the feel is great. And the only interesting part about this table is that comes with led lights and usb ports. Wouldn‚Äôt highly recommend.

I bought the desk because of the lighting.  The light was broken and didn't come with a remote. I wrote to the company two weeks ago and got no response.  Unfortunate because the rest of the product is fantastic.

It came damaged but Amazon made it right!

Everything else was okay.

Why is one of the floor holder pieces not fitting ü§î  this is a huge pain because the desk isnt leveled now because someone slacked on their job when drilling the holes.

Not solid by any means

Sorry for the bad photo, this is actually of my chair, but you can see the desk! It fits my gaming PC perfect on the lower shelf! The lighting is easy to install and looks clean! The desk was easy to assemble. It‚Äôs light. It‚Äôs sturdy. Most of all, it‚Äôs super functional. Plenty of storage and the built in power socket is a godsend! Overall I would definitely recommend this desk! It‚Äôs a great value for the money! I‚Äôve had it several months now, and it still looks brand new. It isn‚Äôt wobbly and is very sturdy, even being on carpet. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô6 285 pounds and have no issues fitting at this desk or being uncomfortable, and my wife is 5‚Äô3 95 pounds and is comfortable at the desk too, so it will be comfy for all sizes! I know some desks are too short and taller people hit their knees in em lol

For the most part was very easy to assemble, just 2 minor things.. 1 of the holes were a bit too small for screw but was able to widen it a bit and 1 section had to apply force to align.  Follow instructions in detail and it will be easy.Very sturdy, if you have sweaty hands shows fingerprints but easy to clean off. Lighting is nice with multiple colors. Adjustable for your own comfort and style.Its worth the cost. No problems so far.

It was pretty easy to assemble except for the last part (screwing in the top part) and it came with fabric drawers. LED lights were a good touch. But overall very good quality

Instructions were pretty easy to understand. I put it together myself in about an hour and a half. It looks nice. Not the sturdiest, but nice for the price. The lights and outlets are a helpful addition.

I got a corner desk for my daughter and was so impressed I decided to stick with this brand for my son's desk which I am discussing here. All the instructions are meticulously clear and laid out. They even provide spare parts (extra of each bolt or screw).  The desk looks amazing and has stability. It's not wobbly or feel like it will fall apart easily. We had the option of adjusting the shelves or which side we wanted them to be on (left or right) and the same with the gaming hooks. I truly enjoyed putting this desk together. We can comfortably sit and get lots of work done with lots of adjustability to spare. You won't regret this purchase.  I will definitely be getting more items by this seller.

The desk arrived early and the assembly directions were easy to follow. This is a very sturdy desk for it's price. I really like how professional the drawers look despite being made of fabric. I also like how the drawers are able to be screwed to the desk so they don't fall out. Overall this is a very high quality desk and it fits perfectly in my room.

I was very surprised at how much I ended up liking this desk. They cut a lot of corners with materials to make it affordable compared to wooden or complete fiberboard desks, but it's still ends up being sturdy enough, it looks nice and I even like the pattern on the surface. The light has a great range of colors and is a nice addition as well. I especially appreciate the outlet that it comes with. Set up took some time, but was rather fun to put together. It seems really small at first, but once it's all put together, it looks like a normal size desk. The pegs at the bottom give you about an inch of height to play around with so from the floor to the drawers is about 26 in for mine (rather than the 25 that they advertise.) The drawers don't fall like I've seen some other reviewers say, and they have a mechanism that makes it so that they can't be pulled out either. All in all, I really enjoy this desk and I couldn't ask for much more with such a great price tag l.

I have this desk in a relatively small room that only had 48 in to fit in. A lot of other desks of this size are just a flat surface and don't have things that this desk has like three drawers that are actually decently sized and the option to add two lower shelves for something like a desktop computer or a game system. I have two, 24-in monitors mounted to the upper level full-length shelf and it is sturdy enough for me to move them on their cantilever arms without ripping the shelf apart. I purchased the desk that has the carbon fiber look finish. Even though I don't actually care about having the carbon fiber look, I'm glad I purchased this because this has the added benefit of making the desk significantly more water resistant than other desks. While bare wood would leave rings from condensation left behind by glasses, this is very easy to clean. Overall, for a desk under $100 I think that this is your best option if you are limited to a 40-in space.

I purchased this desk for my 10yr old son‚Äôs room. He loves to play with transformers and legos and has been playing on his bedroom floor. I saw this desk and for the price I decided to try it. Once it arrived I had him help me put it together. I gave it 4 stars only because in the directions for when you put the sides on it is kind of confusing. Also one of the straps that anchor the drawer to the back of the desk so they don‚Äôt fall out came out. All in all though it is a perfect sturdy little desk. I got the 39in version and it fits perfectly in a smaller child‚Äôs room. Side note a gaming computer chair will not fit this size desk. If you‚Äôre looking for a child‚Äôs first desk, I would say you a good value for your money.

Nice product wasn‚Äôt too difficult to put together  Week one of the new desk and so far my son loves it

It came with a small crack, but despite that it‚Äôs sturdy and was able to hold my two monitors.

Was pretty easy to put together but I don't think the drawers will hold up very well and not sure replacements are available. The monitor shelf isn't wide enough for the newer curved monitor legs so now we need to replace those. Other than that it's sturdy.

It's a great desk and easy to assemble.  The only issue for me is it cannot support my two 34' curved monitors.  I can mount them on the desk, but if I move the monitors forward on the mount arms you can see the top of the desk start to cave in.

What I didn't like was the drawers were made out of fabric instead of wood

Nice desk came bent but I manage to still put it together it very but is not heavy duty tho

I really like this desk. The instructions for putting it together are clear and it's easy enough but just time consuming. I don't mind the fabric drawers at all and they still look nice to me and slide in and out easily, probably more easily than cheap particle board drawers would. My only complaint is that around the entire edge of the desk it's all chipped-looking and not smooth. I imagine the paint is going to chip off more over time because of it.

Desk is really nice but the drawers are trash they fall out if you accidentally touch them and when pushing them in you have to reach under neath to line them up

Basically it is what we expected and were not disappointed as an additional work ar home desk Excellent value

I really like the desk. The quality is great. Although, I thought the drawers were going to be more heavier than some cloth, I will say it was definitely worth it. Warning! If you dont take your time and read the directions thoroughly, you will end up starting over more than once. So be careful putting it together. The directions arent so great.

Not only is it heavy as in good quality, but easy to put together. I love the fact it comes with different instructions as to how you want to assemble it. The only thing I didn't like was that the desk part is a little thin but other than that I love it and love the storage and overall look I get.

I like the desk ALOT the only thing is I wish the top shelf was bigger my HP desktop is prettt heavy hopefully it holds other than that it was quick & easy to put together!!

She loves this desk with the LED lights and power strip. I wish the drawers weren‚Äôt fabric so it would be a bit sturdier. The instructions aren‚Äôt the easiest instructions I‚Äôve ever had but far from the worst I‚Äôve ever had either. It took me a little over an hour to put it together but I was going super slow and try to not make too much noise to wake anyone up on Christmas Eve ü§£

A couple of the holes on the main board of the desk are misaligned, so it‚Äôs hard to get the screws on right, but other than that, it‚Äôs pretty simple to put together !

We spent around three hours putting it together. There is a screw on the top shelf that won‚Äôt go in. I would say we spent a lot of time on that screw. The desk works as it is, but it still was frustrating.

My only issue is that the main part of the table has very concerning crack in it.

I love the sturdiness of the desk & the LED lights! Putting together can be timely

This desk is cute and is the perfect size to share it with my schoolwork and makeup. although it feels very cheap, and the drawers are made out of felt cardboard. also some of the parts are difficult to put together. (also the drawers have a special rope attached to the desk so it would be impossible to fall forward or backwards)The LED lights and outlet is 10/10 tho, makes it look fancy.

Perfect for a teenagers room

If you‚Äôre looking for a computer desk that doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room but still holds enough for an entire computer set up, this desk is it. It‚Äôs perfect and the assembly was so simple and easy. Completed product is durable and sturdy.

ROLANSTAR‚Äôs Computer Desk was as described in that there was not much more surface room for anything other than my laptop, 2-monitors, and external mouse and that‚Äôs what I wanted it for. The framework construction was a middle of the road design, but the 2-outlets, 2-USB ports, and type C port were nice amenities to have within reach. I wasn‚Äôt so fond of downloading an App for LED lighting accessibility but was not a deal breaker either. I did like that I could hang my headphones on the side of the desk and the adjustable shelving was sufficient for storing my manuals. This desk was adequate for my needs.In terms of assembly, I was one of those kids who put square pegs into round holes, so I‚Äôm not surprised it took me some time to assemble this desk, but I don‚Äôt think it was the instructions that was the problem‚ò∫Ô∏è.

I assembled this desk with the help of my 2 kids. I think it took us like an hour to assembled it. The manual and the picture with the step by step instructions is very clear and very simple to follow. I like the rustic brown color. I did not expect that this desk is big and long..lol I love my desk. It looks pretty decent and sturdy. But the 2 metal like sticks that was supposedly be in the back was short. It did not reach from both end, so I did not put them in the back.  And also it was missing 1 screw for the electrical outlet good thing that I have extra small screws that was just right and perfectly fit in so both end of the outlet are screwed. That is why I gave 4 stars. And other than that, so far I have no complain. I like it.

I wish it was a little wider on both the shelf and the main desk there‚Äôs not much room for anything. I love the light but I can‚Äôt play music on a speaker and have the lights on mic mode at the same time. I wish there were more patterns for the lights without having to use the phone. Over all I do love it it‚Äôs looks very nice and the drawers are big enough to hold what I need them too.

The look of this blends well in any house. A little difficult to build, but follow the directions to the tee, and you wont have a problem. Highly recommend!

Got for my daughter to study at takes a little time to get it together  but it‚Äôs seems to be made well

Great value for the price, the rgb light look great the shelves on the bottom of the desk Great for is you have tower or laptop to put it there. The drawers and carton and fabric, which is good enought to store ur stuff. Looks nice the quality for the price it matches. It has out let built in it. It took me about 3 hours to put it all together.you should pay attention if you need a desk that is deep ( width) , this deck is not. The length is good but it's not wide.

This item is compact but adequate for weg. computer side desk in a bedroom or other small space.  Putting it togeather was not too difficult, BUT BE VERY CAREFUL ABFOUT KEEPING THE VARIOUS SIZE BOLTS SEPARATE, and CAREFULLY READ/FOLLOW DIRECTIONS!!!  Don't try to wing this one.......It is basically pretty well made, but the desk drawers are poory supported-  they just sort of hang there in the drawer slots, and if you push them in too far they fall.  Dumb.  Put in a simple support and/or drawer stop, for God's sake.

For what the desk cost, it was good and I am happy. The top of it feels a bit cheap, but it is smooth and all of the metal framing makes it sturdy. Drawers are honestly fairly nice for what they are, and the instructions are clear. No real issues with the desk, but you are getting what you pay for here. If you plan to get a monitor, depending on its height, the 47inch may be a a bit tall (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù) but it is fine for me personally!

Good desk, the drawers are fully cloth.

I built this desk for my 13 year old son, who by the way loves the desk, however I found it a bit tough to put together. Lots of screws, Allen key, etc‚Ä¶ a lot of things to put together.Took me probably an hour, with much frustration.However, it‚Äôs a very nice desk for the price.

Shows finger print all over. Have to keep cleaning it. Installing it takes a long time but it's not hard. Has extra parts too, which was helpful.

Drawers are very low quality but not what I care about as I didn't need drawers :)

Great deal for a student!

Was very good.wast to built

the unit itself is sturdy and functional. I like the additional usb and power plugs and the lighting under the top adds some ambiance. I don't like the cheap cloth drawers that are held up by a strap in the back...they fall out easily and dump the contents. Other than that...it is a good unit

Easy to put together. Wish it was a little taller. Not high quality but serves its purpose

Was suspicious at first of the cheap price but easy to assemble, perfect for teenager room

This task looks really cool as if it is made of carbon fibre and is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It is nice that you also have the option of putting the top rack flush with the back or hanging over. The only issue I have is the actual surface could be a little bit deeper to put a laptop properly on.

It really is a perfect desk for any school kid; however, I‚Äôm an 80-yr old great grandma but I‚Äôm still a girly girl in my heart. It has a kool string of fiber optic lights that really enhance the room.  It‚Äôs quite sturdy. I love it so much!  Oh, and I chose white.

Great little desk I have made an office in my bedroom and this fits Great under my TV and infront of my window

I had this crazy idea to purchase this as stand for a vanity instead of a computer desk. Its was very easy to assemble, they sent more than enough screws in case you misplace them. It‚Äôs very sturdy and stable. Waiting to find the perfect chair.

I was able to follow all directions to assemble this desk by myself. I also like the bag of extra duplicate connector parts such as screws. I love my new desk.

Loved the space and LED lights. Was used for a gaming setup and worked well for what I needed

Perfect for my daughter in college.

This is a really nice desk for the price.  My 14 year old son and I put it together in aobut an hour. It might be a bit tricky for one person, but doable. All the pieces lined up nicely. It feels sturdy and good quality. My son loves it.  Just for reference, the monitor in the photo is 27" so it makes the desk look a little smaller.

Excellent product

We bought is a gift for our granddaughter - she just loves it. The desk is sturdy, provides ample storage, and simply look cute with the light on (her words).

Easy to put together. Looks very nice

The table is spacious and it looks great it can accommodate any needs for your table the quality is top notch

It is a small desk measure before but perfect for your basic computer needs!! Love it took about 20 minutes to build led lights work amazing and the extra outlet connection is a must have!

It‚Äôs multifunctional, very elegant and the best part is getting to build it, it‚Äôs amazing

Holy cow best built and most solid desk I‚Äôve ever put together. Incredibly well engineered.

Easy to assemble - nice light strip - good colors - can't wait to add my computer and two monitors to it.

This was a PERFECT desk for a college student. Packaging, assembly and quality‚Ä¶these are a must!

Good quality

Easy to put together...except for me who put the top shelf together backwards.  My fault.  I love the desk, the lights, the drawers.  It's perfect for my small apartment.  Sturdy.  I would definently say buy it!

The desk wasn't too bad to put together.Make sure to follow the instructions, I would say there's just one step that could mess anyone up, if they dont.It had extra screws, which was good because I accidentally dropped and lost one myself.The fairly sturdy desk comes with plenty of space, its own outlets, both usb and standard, and the light strip you can attach works really nice.It helps my work at night, when I don't want my bright light bulb on, but don't want to fumble around the desk in the dark.

Just put this desk together for my son in college.  It is the perfect size and very well made for the price.  It did not take that long to assemble and the led lights underneath are an added bonus.  Great little desk.  He really likes the hooks on the side of the desk too.

Perfect size for my preteens. Easy to put together

I really love the look of this desk. It took about 2 hours to build by myself. I was impressed with the overall quality. The desk feels very sturdy and not wobbly at all. It does give you the option to put the spot for the computer on either the left or right side

WELL BUILT, GOOD PARTS, GREAT DISPLAY!STILL GETTING COMFORTABLE WITH IT.NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO TURN IT OFFUSING IT WITH AN M1 MAC AND A 24" MONITORWILL KEEP YOU INFORMED

This desk was awesome to make.  First time instructions are so easy-to-use. Really I love it  Beautiful, light pretty, I recommend it.

It‚Äôs a nice desk and has lights that make it a fun experience while using the computer.

Really love this desk, it‚Äôs light weight, so pretty, the instructions are clear as day, took me about 2-3 hours to build, mainly using it for gaming and doing my nails which is perfect and you can control the lights on your phone which I LOVE!

My son was ecstatic when he saw this desk. The built in ports and lights are awesome! Great purchase and size is perfect!

This was easy to put together and is very sturdy. The lights are nice, but the star of the show is the built in outlets on top of the desk. No more climbing under the desk to plug and unplug accessories as I need them. I'd purchase this again.

Pleasantly surprise how quick it took to assemble. Instructions were easy to read. Perfect fit and very nice materials. Extra bonus are the colorful led lights underneath. The three draws are sturdy and make the unit look really nice.

I am really impressed with this desk! It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for, perfect for my work computer at home. Very study, no issues. I really like the style and very spacious. It was easy to assemble, definitely recommend!

I love this desk. It is super cheap and very easy to put together took me about an hour by myself. Super cute and very sturdy. Cheap price but not cheap product

Great size and fit for a small room

I recently bought this desk, and assembling it was easy.  For the price, it's an absolute steal. It‚Äôs the perfect size for my home office, giving me just enough space to work without overwhelming the room. I love the LED lights. It adds personality to the desk.  I am happy with this purchase.

Purchased to upgrade my 12 yr Olds desk. It is a nice desk. The drawers are convenient. Lighting Is fun. The big selling point for me was in the outlets. We no longer need a power strip to plug everything in. He can charge his phone, plug in lights, headphone charger etc. The hooks on the side are nice for headphones. Overall, for the price, it's very nice. Installation wasn't bad. My son and I did it together. We did get mixed up with the shelves on the side, but it was my error, and instructions were clear. Parts clearly labeled and arrived undamaged.The only downside was his large computer monitor was too wide to stand on the top shelf. We mounted to the wall, so it was a non-issue. But check the measurements if you have a wide based monitor and cannot mount.

This desk was a great buy! The price was good, it was simple to build (my 12 year old was able to do a lot of the build on his own) and it looks great!

Gaming & homework desk.

It‚Äôs exactly how it looks in the picture, very sturdy, and has plenty of space

Easy to put together. Love the lights.

Exactly what I wanted.  Perfect size.  Easy to put together.

Easy to assemble, the color is beautiful. Fits perfectly in the space!!

I purchased the rustic brown 47.2 inch computer desk on 06/13/2024. When the box arrived I thought they had shipped the wrong item as it was too small a box for a 47.2 inch desk. When I opened the box I found out that the top panel was actually made of three smaller panels, of course then leaving two seams visible. Not cool. I proceeded to follow the directions and assemble the desk. The directions have you start the assembly with the desk upside down. There are many screws/parts and small tools provided to assemble it so it is time consuming. Most of the screws are allen head screws and they provide a small allen wrench to fit them. After about two hours of assembly, it came time to turn the desk over to complete the next step. Well as I turned the desk over, the left side desk bracket and support leg easily pulled the grommet out from the particle board as happened to other purchasers as seen in other reviews. In my opinion, this seems to be a poorly designed and cheaply made desk, which I should have heeded the saying, "you get what you pay for". Since I had spent a couple hours of my time assembling this item and had opened all kinds of bags and removed all kinds of packaging, and would have to take everything back apart again, returning the item was not really an option. So the instruction manual had a contact email address foe Seventable customer service and a statement that they would replace any damaged parts free of charge. I sent them the make, model, Amazon order number, description, date of purchase and the specific part number I needed a replacement for via email. They responded that they couldn't find the order from the info i provided and to send them the the 17 digit order number (which i correctly sent the first time) and screen shots of the order info and item purchased. So I did this again, sending the order number I already had included and screenshots of the order info and item description. Again I received an email that they couldn't find the order info to remedy the situation and to contact Amazon to get the correct info. I called Amazon customer support to ask if I had the right order number (I did), and asked them why the vendor wouldn't be able to find the order with the info I provided them, and Amazon said they couldn't see why they couldn't find the order info. So I emailed Seventable a third time and said that the info I provided was correct. They responded back to contact the seller (Amazon) to solve the problem!! Really? Amazon is not the manufacturer, Seventable is and they have the replacement parts and said they would replace the parts "free of charge". Lastly this item is so flimsy they provide wall anchors to "Keep the desk from falling over" (in the manual). So do you want to risk your computer equipment and peripherals from being damaged or someone getting injured by it flipping over? My recommendation is not to purchase this desk and based on my customer service experience, not to buy from this manufacturer/seller.

As my brother was putting this together, screwing the bottom pieces in yes they are the correct screws for the right parts. The screws went right through the top. They were  to Long and if you did not screw them all the way in they would not hold it together properly.

The desk was damaged.  The fabric drawers are one of the worst ideas ever. They are flimsy and will stain.  This will be going back.

It‚Äôs 34inOn the website supposed 47in

Very cheaply made. I was half way through putting the desk together and the brackets popped out once I put the screws in. Don‚Äôt waste your money get something with better quality

Very bad material never recommend

Engineered wood cracks upon assembly, hard to follow instructions, and comes with a million pieces.

I bought this table and didn‚Äôt realize how time consuming and difficult it was. I re-read the instructions so many times but unfortunately it did not help I couldn‚Äôt put the stand up due to the bottom piece. I also didn‚Äôt realize how easily it could break due to how fragile it is.

The parts of computer desk are not complete and while assembling we noticed that some parts were missing.We can't do compelete assembling.

So surprised by all the great reviews.  For the price ($160) it's absolute junk.  I don't see this lasting more than a few months.  I expected one solid top but it comes in 3 seperate pieces.  It looks like something that should cost in the $50-$80 range.  I feel duped and ripped off.Drawers are very cheap and won't hold anything with any kind of weight. As soon as I saw the tiny box it came in I knew it was junk.Do not recommend for the price.

Missing part and would not replace but asking to return after spending over 3hrs for setup

Broke before even using it, and half the screw holes were stripped and bolts would not tighten

I ordered Black 47." . Directions are very clear. Took about 1 hour and 30 minutes by myself. The only complaint or problem I had was the screws for the shelves . The Allen wrench that came with desk was to some , at first the thought maybe if was a Phillips screw because it wouldn't turn screw. They smaller Allen wrench was just too small. Luckily I liked putting things together or fix so I have tons of tools and had the right size to complete the desk. Desk is very sturdy even the fabric draws you just have to make sure the brackets the drawers sit on actually snap in. I had to squeeze the lip that goes into the square holes so that they did snap in and they aren't gonna come out.  They only thing I am nit crazy about is the top being three pieces,  there is small gap because no matter what I tried they wouldn't aline to be flush with each other. But it's still beautiful  and for under $100.00 I can live with it.

This desk is great.  It works well, and the LEDs are really cool.  The assembly is just time consuming.  I was able to put this together by myself, but you do need to read the instructions very carefully.  Some things can be a little confusing at first, but once it's all together, it's a great desk.

This desk is nice for the price. I wanted to downsize to save space. I love the option to elevate my monitors to allow for the desk space. I love the keyboard tray, although it is not smooth on the tracks, and I think it could be a few inches wider to better accommodate both a full size keyboard and a mouse. The drawers are fabric, which I didn‚Äôt realize, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I actually cut a hole in bottom of one to allow my Wi-Fi router to stand upright on the bottom shelf. It hides it nicely but it‚Äôs still breathable since it‚Äôs fabric. My husband says it was a pain to put together, but for the price, I expected that. It is not flimsy once it‚Äôs put together. Overall I‚Äôm happy with my purchase!

I wish the top desk part was in one piece and I had a difficult time getting the screws to screw in well in the pull out (keyboard) drawer . Other than that, super cute, easy to put together (for a female too!). It didn‚Äôt take me long to put together I made mine into a vanity and it looks great!

Very nice work desk. Large enough for two monitors, a laptop, docking station and notebook.  Sturdy and nice quality.  I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt be deep enough but it ended up being great!!  Highly Recommend!!

I never write reviews but we were happy with this desk! Everything was numbered and included even the tools you will need are in the pkgs Everything labeled and instructions were easy to use understand my son loves it!!!! The LEDs are nice and comes with a scan code to download an app.. many different colors and tones to the lights!! It's the perfect size and sturdy!! I would recommend 100%

Very easy to put together, instructions were clear. Sturdy desk

My son put this together for me. He said it wasn‚Äôt difficult. It‚Äôs just what I needed for my computer in my craft room. I have cats that get on my keyboard and mouse when I type, so I knew I wanted one that had the hidden storage for it.For those who say it‚Äôs flimsy, you get what you pay for. It‚Äôs sturdy enough and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be immovable. I also wanted my monitor up so the main area was free because I have several cats who like to be petted when I‚Äôm on my computer.Very satisfied!

My item needs picked up at my house. Too heavy for me 82 to carry it to a up store. So what isn't it a free pick up. Your coming again  to my house this week

The desk was nice but this was for my son and as he put it together he noticed there was a few missing pieces to the top drawers

Fabric drawers look cheap. The keyboard tray is shakey and not designed for frequent opening and closing.

Ok for the price, Chinese import misaligned at multiple places

I have nougat this desk for work and it‚Äôs ok, could of been better but it‚Äôs ok!

Low quality of surface and mdf coverage

Like the product, just thought it would be more heavy duty then it is.

The instructions were very understandable. I liked that the tools you needed were provided. Although it took about 3 hours to put together it wasn‚Äôt very difficult. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the drawers only have ledges and not complete support under them. I like how you have options on design.

Nice desk and very easy to install. It took me about an hour to put everything together. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. GIving 4 stars because it's a bit small and the drawers are not very study.

This is a nice desk, however, be warned the top piece is actually in 3 pieces. It looks like 1. The drawers are a little questionable since they are cloth like, not wood. They are a bit small. I‚Äôm pretty handy on putting things together but this desk took about 3 1/2 hours to assemble.The cool feature is the underneath light that can move with music.

Looks good, but the desk is not deep enough and consists of 3 parts. The table is also not very rigit. Took 2 hours to assemble.

Shipping took forever as it got delayed even though it was prime shipping and stated it be here in a day. The item arrived the box was damaged but the item inside was okay. The table took about 3 hr to build. The material is decent for the price but not the best material to use in the long run.

Somehow I didn‚Äôt see that it had 4 fabric drawers with fabric covered cardboard fronts. While this may not work for some, I decided to work with it by placing organizers inside the drawers. Fairly easy to put together and appears to be sturdy enough for my needs.

So when building and putting together the doursIt made no sense been working on it 4:20-7:14 well still working

Looks nice.  A bit narrow. Not the easiest to put together on your own. The instructions were well written.  I just have to get used to everything being in a different spot now as it's much smaller than my previous desk. Drawers are nice, but an odd size. They are long and deep, but so narrow they can't fit a file folder.  All in all, pretty good

Make sure u have handy man and gorilla glue to make it work if you are in middle of assembling it. Otherwise not bad for the price you pay.

But not as well assembled as there were two or three nut inserts that were loose in their holes and one miss-drilled hole, although the desk is useable without using these.

This desk is sturdier than I expected for the price. The black metal frame matches other items I have bought from that Swedish store for around the same price as a bonus, but this has more options than those. I like the customization options for the  drawers/shelves on wither side and the riser can be flush with the back of the desk or hang over. The desk top itself is spacious and allows for several pieces of equipment necessary for recording and mixing music (the monitors will fit in there for that part with some adjustment). I did add 3M clips along the back of the riser to keep most of the cords tidy, but still need a few more. It took me a few hours to assemble by myself as I‚Äôm dealing with a serious foot injury that required frequent sitting breaks when doing the standing portions. We will see how it holds up, but overall I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. I took off one star just because it took so long to put together.

It is a nice desk with all the accessories I need, power & USB plugsOnly negative thing is the drawers are too small to put a letter size paperBut it‚Äôs a nice looking sturdy desk..

Attractive looking, space saving desk at a great price. Takes time to put together, and not a fan of the ‚Äúthree piece ‚Äú table top (could of been a more solid 1 piece) but overall very happy!

The drawers made of fabric the rest is fine

Accessories are numbered and assembly is a lot easier, but it does take a while to get the desk set-up. A very good value for money.

detailed instructions and easy to assemble

Like üëçüèª it

Ready to Assemble furniture can be a challenge to assemble but this desk was pretty straight forward to put together. The parts fit well and were well labeled. As a recommendation, I would keep all of the various parts in the bags they come in for easy identification during the assembly process.We had a small space to put a desk in a guest room we just had a Murphy bed installed in and needed something this size and that was affordable.I was skeptical about the cloth drawers but they are sturdy enough for papers and light office supplies.There are many ways to customize this desk by placing the shelves at the bottom or stacking all of the drawers on one side. I opted for a balanced look of open spaces on each side at the top and two drawers each side.The LED lighting adds a touch of fun to the desk and I like it!

The process took about two hours, but once it‚Äôs done, it looks great and it works just the way I needed to. I love the extra charger port on the top of the desk.

Our 11 year old loves this desk. It is sturdy and perfect for his gaming computer!!

My daughter needed a bigger computer desk and I purchased this one.  It's easy to assemble and one person can do it, but it would go better with two people.  It's quite sturdy and roomy. You also have the option to customize how you want the drawers and shelves set.

It is a smaller desk, not very deep, but it works perfectly in smaller spaces. It is very nice as well. The LED lighting removes the need for a desk lamp.

First went through manual to make sure everything was in the box, it was so nice and organized and every piece was labeled made it so easy to build.  Lists of room the lights work perfectly and I like that you can build the draws the way you wand you can have 2 on each side or 3 and 1 and you can also put the shelf on the bottom or top.  Would recommend highly.

After 4 years of working from home on a plastic table, I decided to get a real desk. I reviewed a lot of desks and was a bit leery that this one didn‚Äôt have any reviews. I was definitely not disappointed!  Though it took a while to put together, the instructions were very easy to follow.

I love this desk. It is perfect for what I need. I LOVE that it has a place to plug things in on the desk itself. makes using my mug warmer and chargers so much easier. Would highly recommend.

So spacious and sturdy‚ù§Ô∏è

Very nice for the price, easy to put together just make sure to read the instructions. It took me around 2 hrs to build it because I didn‚Äôt read the instructions lol

Assembly, price, quality all as good or better then expected

It was a lot of work to put together, but the results are amazing. It‚Äôs prefect.

It looks good when out together. The instructions were clear.

Super easy to put together and the instructions were super helpful , I would say I took me around 45-60mins.

I love the LED lights

I absolutely loved this product. I am 11 years old and was still able to put it together easily. It has so many extra parts like screws and the instructions were very easy to follow. The one thing to be aware of is that you will need a small allen key, otherwise this product was amazing!

My son loves his desk it looks good in his room!

super cute lolz

Surprisingly sturdy!The LED‚Äôs work very well!Relatively easy to assemble.My only complaint is that the top panels (the shelf and the desk surface itself) are each made up of separate panels. the desk surface is made up of 3 panels that DONT sit flush with each other. While this doesn‚Äôt really effect functionality at all, it isn‚Äôt very aesthetically pleasing.Overall for the price, it is definitely worth it.

Absolutely love this, lights, sturdy ness, keyboard tray, storage and good looking.  Mine is in my living room and it looks amazing and fits right in (i got white).  I love this, easy and fun to put together all by myself, i absolutely love this.

this is the best desk ever it has everything you need, electrical plugs, lights, lots of room, the drawers are sturdier then the add said. easy directions even a child could follow went together fast and easy. it is very spacy and  there is lots of room for most everything you need love it. best investment i ever made.

The sleek and modern design fits perfectly in my home office space. The table is incredibly sturdy, with high-quality materials that feel durable and long-lasting. Its ample surface area comfortably accommodates my monitor, keyboard, and mouse, with room to spare for other essentials. I appreciate the thoughtful cable management system, which helps keep my workspace tidy and organized. Assembly was a breeze, thanks to clear instructions and well-labeled parts. Overall, the computer table offers fantastic value for the price, combining style, functionality, and durability seamlessly. Highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable workspace solution.

Very clear instructions and love the fact it comes with extra screws just in case you happen to lose them during assembly. It is sturdy and love how many compartments it comes with; great for storage. I love the power outlet design. It looks good and no need to get a power extension cord

I am surprised how well this desk holds up.  I have 2 computers, one with a large monitor and tower, the other is a 3-in-1 and is heavy. The 3-in-1  sits on the monitor shelf, the large monitor sits on the  desk with the tower on a shelf above the drawers.  I thought the drawers, being cloth would not take much weight, but they do! I have not used the lights but I certainly appreciate the power outlets - so convenient to have them so close. I highly recommend this desk for anyone who needs a spacious, efficient, sturdy desk.

ON Time Delivery. Easy to Put Together-Three Hours Including First Making Sure all Parts Were There. Using it Now as I Review;Great Piece of Furniture. Matches My T>V Cabinet From Amazon

A great desk for work and personal use.

It looks as advertised and was easy to assemble

The LED lights and outlets are awesome features. Perfect size for any apartment!

The wooden desk is great for my needs as it is lightweight and has a decent amount of storage space. The LED band adds a touch of modern feel without being intrusive. In addition, the assembly was really easy as it took me less than an hour. However, the disadvantage of this lightweight desk is that the drawers are not made from wood and they are not wide. Regardless that is not an issue for me.

Perfect for my teen.

I was looking for a desk for a smaller space and this has been perfect.  Assembly took awhile but was pretty simple overall.  Would recommend

The product was good as expected, had all the features and is sturdy enough for the money. The seller provided excellent support when I needed a replacement for a part. I highly recommend!

We bought 2 of the large ones. And we liked them so much we ordered 2 of the smaller ones for our daughrers. Perfect desk for the gamer family.

Looks great though. Make sure everything is lined up straight.

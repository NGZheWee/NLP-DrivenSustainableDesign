The first time I used them to filter just a small amount of coffee grounds at less than boiling water temperature, the bag split immediately creating a huge mess. The same thing happened when I tried again with even less coffee coffee filtered even more slowly at even lower temperatures - the issue was clearly with the strength of the bag. The only way was able to keep to keep the coffee from splitting at creating a huge mess is by double filtering, which meant that the bags were used up twice as quickly. This not only makes the filters twice as expensive per filter as they advertise, but creates twice as much waste per cup of coffee, completely negating any l environmental benefit claimed by the company. I will never buy this product again.",-2

I have purchased your No. 4 coffee filters for years [26 boxes] and, until my most recent purchase of 2 boxes (100 ea.), I loved them. The first box's ""'never break' patented wave seam"" failed every time, allowing grounds to pass into my brewed coffee. Each time I thought that perhaps it was an anomaly and that the next filter would be fine. Nope. The first filter out of the second box failed similarly and, since then, I've been using two filters for each brew. That's not what I paid for and certainly doesn't meet your advertising of promoting a ""Healthy Planet"" and ""Quality with Integrity."" I can provide a long list of Amazon order numbers from the past few years if you'd like to substantiate my brand loyalty. But if this issue isn't resolved, you've lost a good customer.

I buy them when I can as I like that they are all unbleached and chlorine free.The #4 coffee filters work fine in a typical brew system or in use with a pour over style. I had used it in the latter and found that if I pressed the filter with my hand to squeeze out the last of the liquid from the coffee grounds, that it could tear along the seam. I don't think most people would encounter this as most people would use this for coffee to drip into using a machine. But just keep it in mind if you have a need to hand pour hot water over ground coffee- just let gravity do its job, and don't bother to help it along by squeezing out the rest.It is compostable! After you make your coffee, toss it all into your compost pile!They seem to make their products with care. Whenever possible I select one of their products over the typical beached or plastic laden product. I am not at all perfect in how I treat my environment, so even if I could do a lot better, I like knowing that t here are companies creating products that help us to have the ""Least possible environmental impact"" in our day to day lives.",1

That may be a good thing. The filter is squeezing every bit of oil/flavor out of the bean. But I think it’s a hair too slow. I have to stir it for some time before almost all of the water has drained through the grounds (sometimes ripping seam of filter, releasing grounds). As I said, some may find the slow release desirable. I do prefer them over flimsy filters.Update: I switched back to oxygen bleached filters and realize now how much the cardboard flavor from brown filters was tainting my coffee. Will never use brown filters again. Plus, I don’t have the backup issue.I tried a different brand of unbleached before going back to white and no matter what I did, they constantly flopped over the grounds during brewing, resulting in truly disappointing coffee every single morning. I’m done with brown filters.",-1

I'm an average coffee drinker, I don't taste any difference in using these compostable filters vs a regular filter or the ""gold"" mesh filter that came with my coffee maker.  Hope they work just as well for you.",2

I buy them when I can as I like that they are all unbleached and chlorine free.The #4 coffee filters work fine in a typical brew system or in use with a pour over style. I had used it in the latter and found that if I pressed the filter with my hand to squeeze out the last of the liquid from the coffee grounds, that it could tear along the seam. I don't think most people would encounter this as most people would use this for coffee to drip into using a machine. But just keep it in mind if you have a need to hand pour hot water over ground coffee- just let gravity do its job, and don't bother to help it along by squeezing out the rest.It is compostable! After you make your coffee, toss it all into your compost pile!They seem to make their products with care. Whenever possible I select one of their products over the typical beached or plastic laden product. I am not at all perfect in how I treat my environment, so even if I could do a lot better, I like knowing that t here are companies creating products that help us to have the ""Least possible environmental impact"" in our day to day lives.",1

I did, so I quit them. My cholesterol plummeted.If You Care's unbleached, all-natural #4 cone filters are my go-to non-perforated coffee filter. The fact they're responsibly sourced, biodegradable, and compostable is wonderful, but I love them because they're tasteless, they never tear, and produce a rich coffee in which the flavor of the bean shines through.Just a best-in-class product that gets used daily, and a terrific value at this low price. - (Was this review of use?

Within just moments of putting in this filter and the new carbon filter our room smelled like someone sprayed Black Flag fly spay all over our room!!! Arg!!! :(  We thought it was just the carbon filter, so we replaced that with one of the original Winix filters.  The horrid smell continued.  Then we read several reviews that mentioned the same thing.  We couldn't return the item since we had ordered it so long ago.

That is how much I don't like these replacement filters, I do not think they are filtering out the pollen in the air like the winix filters do. My wife is having a real bad spring due to allergies. If you want to filter out pollen go with the real Winix True HEPA filters.Downgraded from 4 stars to 2 stars, waste of $$ unless you really are OK with your Winix filter being less effective. I am not.------------These have less air resistance then the OEM winix filters so my winix air filter is now making more noise. It sounds like it is on a higher setting now instead of the lowest.I do not think it is filtering as well as with the winix filters.That said I do feel these filters are doing the job. If you are a through and through cheapskate like me then buy them, these are pretty good.Fit is not as good as the original winnix filters but good enough where I do not feel the need for any additional sealing efforts such as weather stripping or tape etc.Update, I no longer recommend these filters.

Indeed, my wife definitely smelled this when I turned on the unit!

I have a Winix 5300 and previously bought the same set from crucial vacuum. It was good, fit perfectly. But this year I noticed it wasn’t described as true hepa and saw that my change filter light came on before the year mark. The original Winix filter lasted well over a year. So I decided to try this set. It wasn’t cheaper in price but definitely cheaper in quality. Really disappointed actually. See photos for comparison to Crucial Vacuum filters. The hepa filter is short and leaves a gap at the top and is more wiggly all around in general. The filter also came with the dent even though the box wasn’t damaged at all. Cool.

There was a gap on 2 sides of the main filter and I could see how that could also cause some of the reported issues of excess airflow others talked about.  BUT I HAVE A FREE WORKAROUND! Take one of your old original black prefilters which are slightly thinner than the ones come with these and cut 2 strips to length matching a long side and short side exactly for the main filter and then use those as spacers between the main filter and the housing.  You will have to figure out your own way to get those sandwiched perfectly between the filter and the housing as it took me a few different methods until one worked for me without destroying the main filter in the process or causing to to buckle.  It will be a super tight fit but this not only seals the edges from unfiltered air but also would seem to rectify the issue with excess airflow causing noise and other issues for the motor.  I don't run mine on turbo speed, but sounds almost exactly the same for me with about the same airflow at each speed.  My carbon prefilters also don't seem like they will fall apart like others say but I can tell the quality is not as good as the original.Now the good news:  The black prefilter is only just large enough to not have any gaps letting air go right to the main filter, so good enough there.  And while a that dreaded gasoline smell from cheap plastics experienced far too often with many chinese products would have been a total deal breaker, that has not been the case for mine.  They smell about the same as the originals and the filtered air coming out just smells clean and fresh.  Too early to tell about any longevity issues, that said, if there are no surprises, this will probably be the filter I get going forward.  Are they as perfect as the originals?  No.  Am I still worried I could get a bad batch with the foul odor? A little bit.  But at about 1/4 to 1/3 the price of the originals (and with my workaround for the spacers) they are plenty good enough.",1

The second set fit just fine! I'm grateful for both the seller's quick response, and for filters that work.I purchased this set to replace my HEPA filter, and I'm genuinely considering digging my original HEPA filter out of the trash and putting it back in my air purifier until I can get my hands on a better replacement.At first glance, the HEPA filter seems to fit into the air purifier well, but the HEPA plus a carbon filter are too thick to fit easily once the plastic screen is snapped into place over them. (Note: I'm using my last original Winix carbon filter, not one of the carbon filters that came with this replacement set.) The frame around the plastic screen bows out around the edges, rendering the screen obsolete--as you can see from the pictures, as there's already a white cat hair almost completely sucked around the edge of the screen, just above the tip of my thumb.(One picture shows how the frame is pushed away from the machine by the filters; the other picture shows me pushing the screen's frame flush to the machine, where it should be.)Possibly worse is that the new HEPA filter somehow changes the airflow when the air purifier is turned on high. I don't know what's going on in there, but the result sounds very turbulent; it's not a smooth, steady flow of air like it used to be. The turbulence is present but not as alarming at the fan's upper-middle speed, and not noticeable at the lower speeds. Unfortunately, I keep my purifier on high speed at night as white noise while I sleep, and it doesn't look like that'll be happening until I get my hands on a better replacement.Although I haven't tried to use the carbon filters that came with this set, I did compare them with my last (and still clean) original Winix carbon filter, and find these replacements somewhat lacking. They're thinner and spongier than the original, but I don't know if that would have had a noticeable negative impact.In short: unless I do decide to pull my old HEPA filter out of the trash, I won't be using my air purifier until I find a better set of replacements. Disappointing.",0

Solomon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2021","I've been using ISINLIVE HEPA replacement filters for the last two years in my WINEX 5200 unit. In my experience, the HEPA filter needs replacement every six month when in daily use (the filter light comes on like clockwork every Christmas and Fourth of July). The carbon pre-filter should be replaced more often, as it collects a sheet of dust in no time which cuts down the air flow efficiency. The ISINLIVE comes with 4 carbon replacements, so you're covered for the life of the HEPA filter.The ISLINLIVE costs about half the price of the of WINEX's replacement offering. It works just as well (as judged by airflow and odor control). REMEMBER: You really need to replace  the filters more often than expected, so cost-effectiveness adds up quickly. the ISINLIVE is not the least expensive filter on the market, but I trust it implicitly--and so will you.",1

The pre-filter has fabric that's more tightly woven than the manufacturer's pre-filter. This has led to restricted airflow and my air purifier isn't able to take in as much air in order to filter it....which is the whole point. Whenever I would put in a genuine filter, I'd notice the difference within a minute (or less) after swapping out an old filter. My air purifier is in front of a closet door where a cat box is, so the purifier is quick to get rid of the smell on a fresh filter. When I put in the filter that came in this pack (after I had to really push it in due to the added foam on the top and bottom), I noticed little difference. It's been a few days and the air quality still hasn't improved and I doubt it will. I'll be purchasing the OEM filters like I should have, it's worth the extra money.",0

I found that these collect the dust and dirt from the living room floor very well. The velcro feature to stick the pre-filter to regular filter is very cool. However, and this was an important thing to note, these filters had to be squeezed in to fit the filter cabinet or filter space on the air purifier machine. They don't quite fit exactly right as easily as the veva brand. Also it is important to note that to the red blinking light, which means something isn't right with the machine, blinks with this filter installed oh, and I never had that problem with the OEM brand filters. So, these do the job although they are a little wonky.",0

They are also the thickest carbon filters I've ever received from a ""knock off"" brand. Seriously, these are so similar to the original that you'd think they're made in the same factory. In addition, i noticed the main filters have a sponge material glued to the top and bottom to give it more of a snug and secure fit inside of the filter compartment. I've never seen this before with other air filters, and it was reassuring to see this seller's attention to detail on the product.I rarely give reviews on products but i really wanted to vouch for this product on behalf of somebody who has asthma and has been searching for a product like this (at a reasonable price) for ages!",1

They do come folded in fourths, so installation is a bit of a challenge due to the deep creases.  (It was easier to keep in place under the clips if the crease is on top.)  I tried to install the 3 main filters yesterday, but immediately noticed a heavy chemical smell upon removing each filter from the plastic bags.  After installation and turning the unit on, the smell was quite noticeable.  I took the filters outside and let them ""air out"" for several hours and then placed them in the garage overnight.  I just reinstalled them, and noticed the smell again upon turning the machine on.  I ran the turbo mode for several minutes, and the smell has now lessened, but still remains.

Yes it does works, however the Honeywell 5250 requires 2 HEPA filters at the same time. Now I have one new HEPA filter left over that has to be used with one of the existing filters during the next filter change or the seller 'isinlive' expects you to buy two packs. Why not offer options, lower the price and sell two HEPA filters or increase the price and sell 4 HEPA filters? Having to cut the black pre-filter to the proper size is annoying too. Despite the annoyances, the price was right. I will just keep comparing product prices the next time I require new air filters.",0

For best results, you should probably change them per the manufacturer guidelines, but if you're desperate to stretch a buck, so long as you're on top of the pre-filter cleaning, and you can properly dust off your charcoal filter with a HIGH POWER electric duster, you should get some decent results out of these.",1

In terms of performance, I can’t distinguish between these filters and the original Winix filters, which speaks volumes about their effectiveness in cleaning the air just as well as the brand-name ones.For anyone using the Winix 5500-2 or AM80 air purifiers, I’d highly recommend these replacement filters.

The carbon filter build quality is leagues better than others I’ve tried and it fits super snug (others tend to leave a gap at the edges or fit loose). The paper filter itself has wider gaps than others I’ve tried which I believe would make it harder to trap dust and dirt, but easier to clean off.",2

For best results, you should probably change them per the manufacturer guidelines, but if you're desperate to stretch a buck, so long as you're on top of the pre-filter cleaning, and you can properly dust off your charcoal filter with a HIGH POWER electric duster, you should get some decent results out of these.",1

Merena,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024","Thus I go through a lot of the actual filter elements. Although I'm unable to test the efficacy of a non EOM element, they seem to do as well as the original Winix elements but at ~1/4 the price. They fit just as well as the original Winix elements and they are an excellent money saver.These Winix filters are Hepa 13 (filtering particles down to 0.3 microns) and if you actually need a hospital grade Hepa 14 unit, (filtering particles down to 0.1 microns) the only units I have found are the Puroair ones sold here by Amazon. Both the Winix and Puroair filters are superior to all others I have compared them to and Amazon sells both.",2

In retrospect though I wish I would have bought the OEM version of theJRPA  filters for my green air encore.  Somethings are just worth the extra money in this case just knowing that I bought the best Bersion available on the market is worth the peace of mind alone.  How do I know the OEM version is better I don’t but the carbon granules on the OEM version is of much greater size allowing fir better absorption of VOC’z and that’s enough for me that in  the future I will spend the extra $10 and get the one I know is made for my unit to perform to its fullest.... so the question fir you is are you willing to spend $10 more even if you are satisfied with this filter....,-1

The carbon filter build quality is leagues better than others I’ve tried and it fits super snug (others tend to leave a gap at the edges or fit loose). The paper filter itself has wider gaps than others I’ve tried which I believe would make it harder to trap dust and dirt, but easier to clean off.",2

For best results, you should probably change them per the manufacturer guidelines, but if you're desperate to stretch a buck, so long as you're on top of the pre-filter cleaning, and you can properly dust off your charcoal filter with a HIGH POWER electric duster, you should get some decent results out of these.",1

As described in the description there is a lot more carbon pellets in this product.  Visually it looked like each hexagon had about 50% more pellets.  I used a kitchen scale and found that the OEM filter weighed 681 grams and this product weighed 943 grams - 38% heavier. I did notice that the mesh appeared to be a slightly tighter weave than the OEM.For the HEPA filter, the construction appears identical -- same size, same number of pleats, and same number and placement of vertical seams.  The fabric appears slightly different and the printing of the air flow direction is different.  But overall the filter visually appears similar to the OEM filter.My OEM filter was purchased 8 months ago so there could be some changes in one bought today.  But ultimately it looks like these replacement filters are similar quality and construction, and has even more carbon.  This could potentially restrict air flow a bit but I use mine to absorb pet odors near a cat box and am happy to have a little less airflow through the filters if it absorbs more odors.",1

After buying ""the best"" and being hugely under impressed, I ordered the first Winix for less than a third of what ""the best"" cost. We have a resident cigar smoker here--so an underperforming purifier left me gasping and smelling like a tavern. What a difference! How I wish we'd started out with a Winix--or two! We were so impressed, I immediately ordered another for the other end of the room (where I sit). Of course, the filters have to be changed more often than those used in a non-smoking environment. Having two--their brand-name set would be pricey. This set comes with the paper (non-washable) filter and the charcoal prefilter--but not the original gauzy washable pre-pre-filter. When I smell smoke on the porch, I wash the pre-pre- and the pre--and we're back to fresh air. When the paper filter gets brown, time to order more. A tip here--save the charcoal pre-filter for when you wash the current pre-filter because you should not put in it back in wet. When you wash it the first time, a lot of charcoal dust goes down the drain--once it rinses without a tinge of black, it will smell like new. It would be fabulous if the paper filter were washable--but then I guess it wouldn't be a hepa filter. When I write reviews, I try to be honest about whether I would buy an item again if it quit working for whatever reason. I would purchase the Winix (the model with the remote--which will work on however many you have) and these discount filters.",-1

As others have pointed out, the filter paper is clearly not anywhere near the quality of the factory filter. It appears air can bypass the pleated paper where it meets the plastic frame. Over time the inside of the machine will get dirty and need to be disassembled and cleaned out. Not an easy task.It also was shipped in the same box with a holiday gift (a blu-ray box set) which would of been fine, but the filters were in a plastic bag with no box of their own so the pleats were pretty dinged up.I will most definitely pass on this one next time and find a better option.",-1

Unfortunately, they are not like the ones that came with the actual unit, that can easily be pulled up by the pull tab.I had to apply force to get it into the unit it was that snug.  Which made me wonder if I could pull it back out with the tab, so I tried, and the tab came right off, remaining jammed in my machine.  I could not grab it out with my fingers.  So I had to find something to extricate it (which ended up being the metal emery board on my fingernail clippers that I had to jab into the end put much force into moving it upwards and out).I decided to try the other filter I had also opened to see if it was also snug, and it too was very snug, so I didn't force it all the way down.I personally would not recommend these.I see there are a couple other listings by other off brands claiming to also fit this unit, but I'm not sure I want to take the chance on having a similar experience.  I guess I will just pay the extra money for the real filters.I will now have to ask Amazon if I can send them back for a refund, even though I opened 2 of the 4 filters.",-1

These fit my LEVOIT Air Purifiers.It also happens they are a near perfect fit for the rectangle opening for the outside intake air of my AC closet. I placed the two side by side and they were about 3/4 of an inch narrow. So I cut 3/4 inch shim to take up the space. My vent provides oxygenated air, but also pollen and other smutz. I have two water proof 12v fans on a timer. Previously, I was using single layer register filters that are little better than a paper towel. These LV-H128 three stage charcoal activated filters are a big improvement. Already, the air from the registers smells cleaner. When the door for the closet starts help latch itself, it's time to change the filter.Along with my LEVOIT Air Purifiers in my bedroom and office, I hope my dusting/vacuum chores will lighten. I'm a terrible housekeeper.",2

Before I even got the iSingo out of the plastic protection I could tell the mesh on the outside had about double the openess/weave, was loose fitting, and had a very thick doubled (tripled?) up seam. As this is the first layer of protection it's not going to work as well as the OEM. I took pictures of both and you can see for yourself. You can barely see the seam and openess of the mesh on the OEM. I had to feel all the way around the OEM to even find the seam, whereas the seam and mesh openess sticks out visually and tactically on the iSingo. Overall, the quality of construction was lesser then the OEM as well. However, the inner black charcoal filter did look about the same.You get what you pay for when trying to save a buck!",0

After about a month and a half of use with the first filter, I noticed a very strong burning smell coming from the purifier. Concerned, I decided to replace it with another filter, hoping for better results. However, just two weeks later, a subtle burning smell started to emit from the machine again.To troubleshoot, I removed both filters and ran the air purifier without them. Interestingly, there was no burning smell at all during this test, which makes me suspect that the filters are the source of the problem.Based on my experience, I cannot recommend these filters. They simply don’t perform well. I’d suggest going for the branded filters from Levoit instead; I used one of theirs for six months with zero issues and no unpleasant odors.

You get what you pay for. But if you're looking for something cheap and don't have a serious need for fine filtration, these are for you. The original filter I have for my air purifier, you can't really see through them as much as these. You can see that the density of the black foam is much less density in these than the original Levoit filters. It's also little hard to notice, but the white folds also aren't as dense either, less folds than my original. The white outside sheet seems to also be of lower density than the original. So literally these filters are less dense in every way that counts.  I don't have allergies or a need for maximum filtration so I decided to keep them. They're definitely way cheaper than the original. I bought an air purifier to help with odors and air circulation after I do home improvement projects for when the dust and spray paint odors/particles fly around. I wouldn't know if I trust these for fine particles, mold/mildew, anything much more fine than what you can see superficially floating in the air. I'll give them 3 stars for pricing and still being able to filter out SOMETHING.",0

It runs quietly, does not take up much space and the amount of dust/allergens it collects when I vacuum off the filters (weekly) or replace the filters (monthly) is astounding. I don't use or put oils in the tiny sponge dot  compartment as I don't like ""fragrance air"" because most such oils smell fake or cheap or perfume-ish. My priority is clean air and these purifiers are REALLY good. You'll see they collect a LOT of particle dust even though you cannot ""see"" it in the air. The result is you do FEEL cleaner air through your lungs and sinuses and you DO feel better. You might tell yourself your AC air ducts are mega-filtered and your home is generally clean and dusted but DO NOT ASSUME anything until you buy one of these air purifiers and see for yourself the amount of stuff they pull out of the air!!!

In the first section I share my initial impressions after experiencing a filter blow-out during a brew.  Not satisfied with that alone, the second section comes after I decided to try and re-create the failure.==========Originally titled: Not recommended for use with Flow Control/Prisma caps. [★★★☆☆]My go-to recipe for light roasts is a modified version of Jonathan Gagné's 10 minute brew, and that was exactly what I brewed first to test these filters. The nature of this recipe often produces a heavily settled coffee bed that needs a bit more pressure to get through the plunge phase.  That has never been a problem... until today.The 'hiss' came early.  Too early, and with too little resistance behind it.  I backed off and looked down to see I had only made it through about 2/3 of the brew chamber.  Pressing again, more hiss.  Truly a first for my.  I shrugged and went about my typical clean-up, but had pause for concern when I removed the cap and noticed the filter not looking quite right.  Took it to the sink, rinsed it off, and found a hole bored clean through it.As I write these thoughts on this, the last day of March 2024, I find myself wondering if I need to go panic-buy a few boxes of branded AeroPress filters, as they are scheduled to raise the price, quite literally, tomorrow.For those of you using the standard cap, these are probably fine.  My calipers read 0.005"", same as the branded filters.  Held to the light, these even seem to be of a more consistent thickness and tighter ""weave"" than the official filter.==========It was at this point in the first draft of this review that I decided to try and reproduce the blow-out without any coffee.  Immediately upon filling the chamber with water I noticed strange white markings in the installed filter.  I held the next filter in line up to the light and noticed nothing out of the ordinary, but the instant I placed it into a glass of water, sure enough, more white markings appeared.  I repeated this process for approximately 12 more filters before the markings finally stopped showing up.  By this point I had also noticed something of a film that had begun to develop in the glass of water I was testing with.  This debris was also present in the coffee mug I had been testing filter blow-out in.  Strange, to say the very least.After testing a few more of the filters I decided to take random samples from throughout the remaining filters, still in the box.  Of the 15ish samples taken, I only found one sample that contained these white markings, and filters on either side of it's location in the stack also had them.At this point, I'm not willing to put these thing anywhere near something I'm going to drink, and I am thankful all of this came about with my first attempt at using them, and not some 200 cups in or something.  It could very well be a big ol' nothingburger, but I'll leave that to folks more brave than I to figure out.",1

Thankfully, there are a lot of off brand filters being offered now, at significantly better pricing such as two off-brand filters for the price of one of the brand replacement filters, nuts!This filter is similar to the Levoit Core 300 Pet filter and as of a month in has performed similarly and perfectly without any issues seen so far. There is an outer mesh filter that captures large debris like pet hair for example, then the middle layer is the HEPA filter, and the 3rd inner most layer has the carbon bits that help capture smells. Overall this filter appears to be doing the job just the same as the original filters, at a lot lower cost. Will buy again if it continues to perform without issue.",1

I am exasperated after trying several other knock-off brand filters only to realize that they were all subparresulting in vast differences in air quality when compared to the performance of the OEM Levoit brand filters. I was super bummed to think I'd have to continue to pay thru the nose for the original Levoits for all of eternity.Scene 2 - Office Building: While surfing Amazon during work hours, I came across these Levoit Core 300 compatible filters and decided to give another off-brand one last try. Naturally, after previous attempts, I went into this with low expectations...Scene 3 - Back to the Living Room: The box of filters arrived, and like an animal of prey with a fresh kill, I ripped the box to shreds while laughing maniacally. (Too much, you say?...okay. Let's try this again...take 2...) The box had arrived, and I was looking forward to gently opening it and testing out these new filters. The first thing I noticed is they have the exact same look and are the same exact size as the Levoit brand filters. Installation is a breeze (as are all filters for the Core 300). I unscrewed the bottom of the unit and pop this new filter in. I then turned on my purifier. There was no rattling or banging or screeching or buzzing...only the sweet sound of my room being filled with purified air just like it did with the Levoit brand filters. ""HELLO!...do you guys smell that!?!"", I ask nobody because I'm the only person in the room. ""It's the smell of clean, fresh air, free of dander and particulates!"", I say to no one again. ""Yes!!! I can smell that! The smell of this fresh air almost makes me happier than the smell freshly minted cash!"", I reply, because talking to no one seems to be a theme here.Scene 4- Fast motion montage over a span of a week of using these new off-brand filters: I have yet to notice any comparable differences from the OEM Levoit brand filters in the behavior of my purifier or the quality of the air. In the last scene of the montage, I have just reached the very top of my staircase. I jump around like Rocky Balboa and proclaim, ""Thank you, off brand filters!"" after not having dropped a single Kleenex or sneezed once during the grueling townhouse climb.Scene 5 - Ending Sequence - Grand Canyon Donkey Trail Tour: I am riding a donkey into the sunset along with my trusty Levoit Core 300 and its new off brand filters. While breathing freely due to these quality filters keeping my donkey allergies at bay, I look to the skies and exclaim, ""Highly recommend!"" to anyone within earshot.The End.",1

I have severe allergies and using an air purifier with a good filter really makes a difference for me, especially with year round allergies in AZ being so bad. None of these filters are super cheap, but you prob wouldn’t want that anyways if you really struggle with allergens.

If you have pets this is a must have. I had a regular filter on my Levoit Core 300 but these work so much better because of the pets. If you have a Core 300 I recommend these over the regular filters for pet odors and pet dander. They work great overall for your other allergens. You will be able to tell the difference after the air purifier runs through its cycle. I highly recommend these.,2

They are also in a very thin plastic wrap that makes them flop around so they are harder to store upright without wedging them between something.In comparison, these are pre-folded and come in a cardboard box that makes them much more manageable, with a lid to help keep ants and etc out of them.I never could find official Chemex filters for a reasonable price, I get the impression they are much thicker and provide a cleaner cup of coffee than these filters, so if your after something to give you Chemex-grade filtering these probably won't fit your needs. These are almost identical in thickness and texture to my cone filters for smaller pour-over systems, just lager so they can fit a Chemex. If your not a fan of Chemex's signature taste and want something more typical though, these should be fine for that. I always rinse my filters, and didnt taste anything unusual in my coffee compared to my other filters.Personally, the form factor and the box make these a good product for -me- and I'm happy with them, though the price is a little high for only 50 filters at about $7.99. That makes it about 16 cents a filter which I suppose is not too bad, though you can certainly beat that with a little luck and patience.",0

Typically, these chemicals get reused.  Sometimes, as they age, the begin to develop crystallization or other impurities.  These impurities can have a negative effect on the process you might be using, so they need to be filtered out.  I've found that the best way to filter most of these chemicals is with coffee filters.The problem with a lot of coffee filters is that they are 1) too small, or 2) not strong enough.  These Bake Choice filters are large enough to fit even my largest funnel.  They are prefolded, so it is relatively easy to get them inside of the funnel.  They are nice and strong, doing a good job with filtration and then not falling apart when I remove them from the funnel to drop them in the trash.  I see no reason why they wouldn't work just as well as for their intended purpose -- making pourover coffee.",0

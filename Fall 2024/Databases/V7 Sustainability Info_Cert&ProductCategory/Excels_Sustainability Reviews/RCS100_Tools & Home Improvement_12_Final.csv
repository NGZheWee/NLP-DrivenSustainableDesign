During assembly, we used a rubber mallet to help join parts--as directed in the instructions. But still, the plastic split along a seam as a result of being hammered with the mallet.  In addition, when we raise the lid holding by on to just one end, the plastic warps and bends down at the other end, and then, when closed, the locking mechanism doesn't line up.Another note: the design of the lid makes it hold rain water and snow melt.

The last straw was my order of bamboo toilet paper getting absolutely soaked, so I ordered this. Small enough to fit on my tiny patio, keeps the rain out as long as carriers bother to use it...My complaint is in the fact that it seems to be made with a cellulose material which attracts booklice like no tomorrow. Maybe this is the case with all deck boxes now as everyone wants to be better to the environment, but I'd gladly take good old fashioned resin in order not to attract thousands of tiny white mites. Thankfully they are harmless and not destructive so it's more of a nuisance than anything, but I still brush my packages off before bringing them inside just in case.Spraying the box periodically with bifenthrin does keep them at bay but I don't know if that will eventually degrade the material. Regardless, it was a very decent price when I bought so even if I only get a year or two out of it that is fine with me.

BUT, it did take some hand strength, which was why my Husband assembled these.THE NOT AS GOOD STUFF: - During assembly, it is very easy to pinch your fingers or clothing, OUCH! So be careful! - The 2nd Unit DID NOT go together as easily, BECAUSE Hubby DID NOT follow those instructions EXACTLY. - Hubby got side-tracked, then he THOUGHT he remembered how to assemble the 2nd unit! Oops! - This time, he went by the alphabetical order, (A, B, C, D) and NOT the INSTRUCTIONS order. - The INSTRUCTIONS ORDER MUST be followed EXACTLY, otherwise assembly problems WILL occur and you will have to disassemble and then reassemble. - DISASSEMBLY IS POSSABLE if done carefully. - To disassemble, you will need a flat-head screwdriver to push down on the tabs to do this! - It took Hubby around 45 minutes to disassemble and then reassemble that 2nd Unit!CONCLUSION: - The YITAHOME 33 Gallon Round Deck Box is a very nice looking, rustic style plastic storage Unit. - To save yourself a freakin' nightmare and a lot of time and frustration, follow those instructions! - AGAIN...

I ended up sitting on the edge of the ring while pulling the body inwards to fit. I honestly thought I'd have to call someone in to hold it down for me.I bought two of these. The first one took me over half an hour to put together and the second took me twenty minutes and went smoother from practising on the first one. Nevertheless I have a very sore fist and I feel like the factory workers got out of doing the hardest part.Overall its good quality and very spacious inside, looks like it will hold over half of the contents of a rectangular trunk. It's really big, doesn't appear so because of the angle of the camera but it's almost double the size of the seat of the blue chair.Make sure you follow the instructions because if you go wrong it will be difficult if not impossible to unslot the parts without breaking them. Also don't panic when you see repeat letters for each of the pieces. There are A, B, C, D wrapped together, and then the same again wrapped separately. You have to put the four pieces together and repeat. Then you join the two halves together. That's the most awkward part along with the ring.",1,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

The main issue I have is that the side panels do not line up correctly/completely with the back panels (see photos). I followed the instructions and slid both the side and back panels over in the bottom slots as far as they would go, but the panels do not fit together at the bottom on either left or right sides. On the left side of the unit the side panel is too far over on the back panel so the screw holes don’t line up. On the right side of the unit the side panel is too far away from the back panel so the screw holes don’t line up. I could only connect the back and side panels together at the top three spots but not the bottom three spots (with the lousy plastic screws provided), which makes the unit much less sturdy. It’s difficult to tell exactly what’s causing this—if it’s a problem with the slot placement on the bottom piece or if it’s something to do with the back and side panels. Regardless, the pieces simply do not fit together as they should.The other issue I had was that the screw holes were too small on the hinges that connect the front and top doors. I had to re-drill the holes on all hinges to get the screws to fit.For what I paid for this unit I expected much better quality.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

I researched the available sheds (Rubbermaid, Suncast, Yitahome among others) and decided to get the Suncast. Unfortunately, Suncast does not ship to California. Ultimately, the Yitahome 27 cu ft shed fit my needs best so I placed the order with Amazon using a $20 off coupon.Number 1: You will likely receive two (2) separate deliveries, one with the sides and back panels as well as the hardware needed for assembly and the second package with the top and bottom sections. Both cartons had some tears and possible re-taping (jpg) but everything was A-OK and all of the pieces were included.Number 2: The instruction booklet and all of the hardware came in a single larger zip lock bag that was included with the side and back panels. The various screws, hinges and brackets were in separate smaller bags. Every single item was included and Yitahome provided some extra screws ""just in case"" (they actually list the numbers of each part to be used and note there are extras in some cases (example: 18 + 1 extra, 12 + 2 extra); very thoughtful service.Number 3: I did encounter some issues during assembly -  all of the panels are well marked and identified in the manual.  Unfortunately, one of the pieces (the left side panel),  would not slide into position no matter how hard I tried to get it to fit (jpgs).  I contacted Yitahome and Amazon on Monday, May 29, Memorial Day, and didn't expect a reply for days. However, Amazon did reach out promptly and offered to send new side panels. By that time, I had tilted the partially completed structure on its side and with the help of gravity, I guess, the left side panel slid into place. In all likelihood the panel needed to be lifted and slid in one motion (not shown in the manual or seen on the instruction video). So, having two people might make the assembly easier.Number 4: After that it was pretty straight forward. I'll reiterate, the instructions are well laid out with good illustrations and, with each part of the process, the manual shows you exactly which pieces are needed. Quite well done I must admit. There were a couple of issues of minor consequence: 1) there were no starter holes for the small metal piece that receives the metal roof arm support (jpg). I rectified this by applying firm pressure using an awl to create screw holes. 2) there was a film of resin (jpg) where a hinge was to be placed. Again, the awl allowed me to clear the obstruction and the hinge slid easily into place.Overall, the shed was easily assembled after fiddling with the reluctant left side panel and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a modest sized outdoor storage shed. If not for the issue with the side panel I would have given this 5 stars. Also, it has not been put through any sort of stress - weather is ideal today and it has only been in service for a few hours. I will update the review if there are changes but we won't get a serious rainfall for many months and the temperatures are seldom over 75ºF. Good luck with your purchase, whichever shed you choose. I do recommend the Yitamhome 27 cu ft outdoor shed.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Wanted one smaller than old box and finally settled on this one. It is very flimsy and two  days after setting it outside we had a heavy rain/hail storm causing the lid to fly open and soaking the towels again. There is a small spot to latch it closed provided you can find something small enough to fit through the tiny holes and your fingers are small enough to work it open once in place. The only thing we had was the smallest lock made (like for a suitcase which fits through the end of the zipper). Terrible design and don’t expect it to hold up long. Would like to return it but that’s difficult once put together and the box it came in was destroyed.

Amazon will not let me tell you about the problems with the first one.  The second one had a manufacturing defect.  I currently have unit number 3 and contacted the manufacturer to ask how to purchase an additional divider.  The unit will accommodate 2 dividers, but it only comes with 1.  The manufacturer was of no help whatsoever.  They wouldn’t even provide the part number of the divider.  All they would say is they don’t sell replacement parts.  That’s what you want to hear when you’ve just spent $350 on their product.  The unit has a lot plastic parts, which makes me skeptical of its durability and longevity.  I feel this one will go in the trash in a couple of years.  I wasn’t’ expecting it to be as flimsy as it is.

The lid has a metal frame that allows the hydraulic lifts on the side to mount to something and gives the large lid some structure.We had the box on our dock to store cushions, the size was great, but the lid warped over time and then the screws on the lid metal frame on the inside could not hold the hold and then metal frame just popped out.Unfortunately it just can’t last very long and you should plan on throwing it away after a 1 year.  I called customer support and chatted with them.  The phone number was not working per their website, but a live chat was working.They could not replace the part, the warranty was for 1 year , which like always is just missed once the item starts to breakdown, and so I am stuck either trying to fix this box or buying another.

I had two delivered and both had minor damage. The delivery box is very large and fairly heavy so you can imagine how it can get dropped, etc. during shipping.Assembly: assembly design is simple and very easy to understand / follow instructions. Problem is that the pieces need to fit fairly precisely...and they don't. At least, on the two I assembled they didn't, and the problem was the same for both products. It's difficult to explain w/out a video or something, but suffice it to say, that if you get a similar product you need some muscle to get the panels to click together. The first one was a nightmare b/c I didn't know what the problem was. I actually ended up having to make some modifications (think power saw!) to get the panels to fit together. The second one was still an ever-loving b*tch, but I figured out a work-around much quicker (I flipped the panels/bottom over and using a 2x4 and mallet hammered the panels together - this was not wonderful but way better/less destructive than my first assembly.) I'm not a contractor but have build some furniture from scratch and put together plenty of pieces that just need assembly. This wasn't a clueless dude fumbling around. This was very difficult.Customer Service: the reason this was not 1 star is because I had a replacement unit shipped fairly quickly when I originally contacted them with the initial cracked (small crack) bottom panel. The person I spoke to was informed and the process was easy/quick. Because they shipped an entirely new unit instead of just a replacement for the damaged bottom panel, I got two of these for the price of one. The damage was minor and the first unit is fully functional, just not defect-free. The 2nd unit also had some damage on the corner of the top panel, but I have no need for another unit and honestly don't want to put another together.Hope this is helpful.",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The other vertical joints are continuous but at the top is a big ol cavity. The ugly: This is the size I needed. If your are flexible in what size and color, check out Lifetime products. They have a line of outdoor storage that used to be good. I have one that is many years old and has been bumped around the country. Still in excellent condition.

Upon receiving the item it had a small rip and tear in the box it was delivered in. I checked the item thoroughly and there didn't seem to be anything wrong with item.The directions were fairly easy to follow, but I would recommend putting the sides together upside down on a firm flat surface and then setting the bottom on the connected sides, front and back. Then taken a rubber mallet and snapping the bottom to the sides in that manner. Much easier process. All screws were properly identified and how they needed to be applied.As you can see by the pictures I supplied my unit warped as it was facing the west and recievithe hot sun. I didn't realize how bad it had become until the backside of the top inside metal frame had separated from the formed plastic top. The screws actually were pulled out from the plastic. With this being said I would have done two things to insure this would not have happened.After weeks of negotiating with the maker and supplier of the product they finally agreed to send me an entire new box. I expressed to them how I believed they could make their product better by including side, back and front lockdowns on all four corners to insure the integrity of the box. I took the initiative to put 4"" hook and eye attachments on each corner. I would then suggest upon receiving your box that you check each screw in the underside top of the box to make sure they are secure.I was frustrated at first with the company but I stood my ground, always trying to be kind and sincere with the people I was dealing with, until they realized that maybe they could make a better product that won't warp in the hot sun. I reviewed my new box within a month of my first complaint. I am giving them 4 stars for their customer service but I would only give them 2 stars on the box itself until they fix the possible warping. I hope this helps. So far the 4"" hook and eye seem to be working. I will let you know after next summer to see if they did the job.",1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": -1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

The box is heavy, I am almost 60 and, although it was clumbsy, I was able to move the pacakged box myself and assemble the box myself.  There are a couple of steps of attaching the lid hinges and hydrolics that would be much easier with two people, but managable with 1.

We opted for this one because of overall decent reviews and speed of delivery compared to other sellers. Retrospectively, this was our worst decision, because it is not worth it. It is fairly lightweight, it does not feel sturdy. It requires purchase of a separate lock, but it was difficult to find a lock that would fit through the whole (it needs to be fairly skinny). We ended up finding one also from Amazon, but unfortunately, it requires an unusual sliding motion to be opened, which leads to the majority of couriers (including many Amazon couriers) leaving packages behind the box or by the door, which defeats the purpose of even having it. Additionally, it is fairly difficult to open, so even when a courier makes an effort to open it, they grab it by the ""deliveries"" sign which pops off every time, and we are too tired of this to keep putting it back in. This is our only purchase from Amazon on which we have so many regrets about buying it, and it feels like a huge waste of money.

My daughter who had a similar problem recommended that we consider a resin deckbox. We looked at several at Amazon, and we liked the looks and size of this one. It is not too large, it is a muted black (like Charcoal gray) and it has a wood grain texture so is a welcome and attractive addition to our relatively small deck.  So far it seems to be a successful way of storing our seed without it being detected by those pesky tree rats, thus we are happy with the product.  We would not hesitate to recommend it to others.UPDATE:  Oh well!  Apparently, I spoke too soon.  We have been away from our home on vacation for just short of a week and were sad to hear from our neighbor that the tree rats have had their way with our deck box.

They do not match up as far as sequence of installation.  We had 2 small pieces missing and the only way we could get these parts was to have an entire shed shipped to us (3 boxes over 100 lbs each) and then had to dig through the boxes for those parts and put them back together to return.  So is someone else getting a shed with 2 missing parts?  My husband had to redrill several metal pieces whose holes did not line up.Plastic floor is very thin and when we used a stepladder to complete one of the processes we found that the legs broke thru the floor.

Packaged well, nice looking, simple to put together by yourself but not something for heavy duty use. Back panel is a thin plasticized version of corrugated cardboard, only suitable for against a building & easily susceptible to poking or other impact damage. If the back panel were rigid plastic like the other pieces I'd rate it higher & it would be more suitable for different locations. The size was right for my needs & will do for now. I bought it specifically for the medium hight. Did not want tall item & deck  boxes were not high enough to store what I wanted. As mentioned before, would have rated higher if back piece was rigid plastic like the others.",0,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

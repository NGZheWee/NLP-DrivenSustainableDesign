As usual Humanscale pricing is exorbitant, hence 4 stars!

Love this light.  Best one on the market

I have been using this lamp regularly for 3~4 years now and have been more than pleased with it overall.Recently however I noticed the finish on the on/off button has started to peel/rub off, leaving a sticky surface underneath which is ugly and unpleasant to touch.  But for this it would be a great lamp.

Really like the auto on and off. T h e base is sturdy and can hold smart devices small desk  things.

An amazing lamp. Good light and attractive

I have used four different LED lamps from Humanscale (Horizon, Element Vision, Element DIsc and Element 790) and they were all excellent. Unlike the cheaper LED lamps, these only have a single light source and do not cast multiple shadows. The Vision's color temperature is warm at 3000K, being easier on your eyes. It is also dimmable, and comes with a proximity sensor. It's a bit pricey but it'll last you a long time.

So far the Element 790 has been outstanding. The color is a bit on the warm side and dims down to a comfortable level when working late at night. It has a sleek modern design and helps create a clean desk aesthetic. I love the compact head, you can put the light where you need it and quickly adjust the power level.

This is the "just right" task lamp and is perfect for home or office.Highly recommended.

Liked so much - bought another

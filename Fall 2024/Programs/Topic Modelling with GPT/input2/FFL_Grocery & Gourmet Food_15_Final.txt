My yerba mate bag was delivered with a three inch cut in the bag. A very large amount of tea was spilling out of the bag into the box. The item isn’t eligible for refund or replacement. It’s not worth risking this happening again.Going to be buying Yerba Mate from my local Co-Op from now on. However I would repurchase this if it was eligible for replacement because I’ve had the this brand of Yerba before and the taste is great.

I've tried several other yerba mates and this is by far the lowest quality. The resulting brew is completely cloudy from all of the dust. I wish it tasted as good as their canned drinks! The best one I have found is called Heretic.

I am a tea enthusiast.  I love oolong.  I saw this tea and thought Id try it.  It tastes like mildewy dirt.  Worst tea Ive ever tasted.

It does not look like high quality mate, it does not taste as yerba mate. It is basically a mate dust mixed with mate sticks that you are making.

Bag ripped open and spilling everywhere. Teas fine tasting. Used for a healthy detox. Easy to make in french press.

This product came to me in a box wrapped in light cellophane after unwrapping. the cellophane I noticed a slice in the side of the bag.. For some reason, I cannot return it - this  item is not eligible. Help

Those items I had received today the Yerba mate was damage cut and shea butter was open , Pls refund My Money

I received this product with a big hole and two tiny holes in the packaging. The teabags are not sealed in anything besides this outer packaging so the tea could easily be contaminated and unsafe. I tried to do a refund or return and this product was listed not eligible. BEWARE buying this product as you will have no recourse if sent a damaged product.

Terrible taste. This is not returnable - do nit recommend!

Item has arrived with a 1 inch hole in it. Even though the item is "not returnable", Amazon was so kind to refund my purchase and allowed to keep this mate. I took chances (risking getting some mouse poo into my gourd) and tried brewing a cup of it - tastes totally disgusting similarly to lawnmower clippings but imho due to that this mate is neither smoked nor aged, having funky sweet finish that I hated the most. The rest of the pack went straight to garbage.Guayaki no more...

I love Yerbe and have bought a few diferent types. This one comes in a terrible package that is flimsy.It is weak tasting and brewing.I got my money back cause,it had a funky smell as well. And 20 dollars? Forget it.

I’ve been a Yerba Mate drinker for many years and I’ve almost exclusively bought Guayaki brand tea bags, when not in Central America. For some reason, the last few bags that I’ve bought from Guayaki have been bland or completely flavorless. I’ve even tried brewing as many as 5 tea bags at once, with no improvement. What used to be my go-to brand of Yerba Mate tea, now is little more than green-ish hot water. Whatever the manufacturer did to reduce their costs has been done at the expense of the consumer end-product.

This is only about how I received my order. It was open and spilled out everywhere as I brought the airspace plastic wrap out of the box.

The product is good, but I ordered and paid for a pack of 6 and only 1 arrived. I don't see any way to get a refund. Not great!

As soon as I open the package the seal was busted and spilling out, I try and dump it in the container and its mostly powder and as I proceed to try the product the quality was the worst I've ever tasted. If your reading this before buying, do yourself a favor and Try another brand.

Yerba ate does have a bitter taste, but this product showed up looking, and tasting, like it had been forgotten on a shelf somewhere.Not good, very dry and full of very small particulates that are not easily filtered.Look elsewhere for your Yerba Mate.

Came with hole in the bag. My mistake for ordering and not checking the return policy. This was my second order of Guayaki organic Yerba Mate. The flavor is better then other brands. I will have to find another seller.

The bag of tea was popped open and tea was spilling out upon arrival. For some reason I cant return or exchange the item and that doesn’t seem fair since it was broken/damaged upon delivery.

Just opened this package, tea bags inside are broken, looks like a mouse chewed it up. The problem here is a can't return it or replace it. If I can get a replacement my rating could change.

It pains me to write this review as I love the product and have been enjoying it for 5 or more years.Most recent purchase came with a hole in the bag and per the manufacturer, not Amazon there is no return policy.As I can't find this in stores near me I'll be looking for another brand with a proper return policy.

I was happy to see my bag of tea arrived quickly, but upset when I opened the package. The item was damaged with multiple holes. Safely consuming this tea based on its presentations is questionable. I was really looking forward to trying out his product as a fan of Guayaki's canned Yerba Mate drinks, but I was left with disappointment.

The item lists it as 75 tea bags but when it came it was loose tea, no bags.  I want to return it or get it replaced due to the false/wrong advertising but it says no returns and no one is helping me.

No good

Did not try since bag torn on all corners! But have loved the tea as it provided slowly elevated energy.I am sure the taste is great, BUT did not try since bag torn on all 4 corners!

The taste is just ok and it didn’t help with appetite as I had hoped. Not worth the price for me. Going back to green tea.

Upon opening the delivery envelope, I found the bag had been cut open, as if with a razor knife.When I clicked on the return item page, I was informed that this product is NOT eligible for returns.So $18 down the drain. The price on this stuff is ridiculously high, but this is the ultimate ripoff.Thanks for nothing

Arrived damaged/ the bag had broken Open and tea bags everywhere, but there is nowhere to ask for a replacement or refund. 😞 plus some of the bags got rained on/ wet

Bag was ripped when received, unsure if still safe to drink!

Package was damaged and you can’t RETURN if damaged.

Everything was going smooth with the process of returning, but when the time came to do the return to get my money back the seller reached out anymore, after sending him reminder of the refund.

Was excited for this product UNTIL IT CAME RIPPED OPEN >:( can’t even get a replacement for it! Waste of my money! Covered in tea powder - thanks a lot >:(

Both of my bags of tea arrived open

No value for my money as I have to throw it out. It arrived with two holes in it and It is not eligible for return. Frustrating

Used to love this until I found out that Yerba Mattes have PAHs in them. Even the air dried ones like this. You can check out their website where they explain they've "reduced" PAH concentration but really, none is the right amount. PAH (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are known carcinogens and recent studies show higher cancer rates among frequent matte drinkers in south america. I'm not taking a chance, personally. I love black tea just as much if not better.

Bag arrived with a hole in it. Tea is everywhere..

Product arrived with a hole in it, leaking into another separate plastic bag it had been placed in.  No returns allowed, definite waste of money…

This was shipped damaged (ripped bag) and a replacement was not sent to me despite numerous attempts

I only tried this brand because the cost of my regular Yerba mate (Eco) jumped from around $9.50 a lb to $25 in a 3 week period. I paid around $15 for this brand. There is no comparison to Eco. I was very disappointed. Guayaki has a weak strange taste. I ended up throwing half the bag out. I did find my beloved Eco brand on another site for the price I usually pay.

Bag was received punctured and there's no return/replacement policy. Don't buy.

I ordered the 75 ct. tea bags thinking it would be a nice alternative to black tea in the morning. I received a large package of loose tea so now in order to use it I have to go buy something to brew loose tea. I’m not very happy that now I need to spend more money in order to use this.

Product packaging was damaged upon deliver. Not suitable for consumption

I was super excited to try Yerba mate but I received a broken package :(

The bag was torn, there was a hole in it & most of the tea came out. I would like to get a replacement since I cannot return it! I’m a regular customer and I’m not satisfied.

Product arrived with a hole in the the bag and loose mate all over the box (and now my living room). Not acceptable from a consumer safety standpoint either. I will not be drinking it.

The package was ripped open when I received it!

The bag had chew marks from rodents

My product arrived with a hole in it. Could I have a new one and send it back?

Product arrived with holes in packaging, no way to return or request refund through app

After telling me my shipment was stuck in customs, I received it a couple days later but it is not USDA organic. It is in packaging from Argentina in Spanish. So I have no idea if it’s the same quality or not as the Yerba that it available in the US.

I am very displeased with the packaging/shipping. The Mate was packed very poorly with other products. When I opened the box, I found that the packet ended up with a couple of small holes from being knocked around. Luckily not a lot of Mate came out of the packet. The Mate itself is pretty good. Please take better care while packaging the product for shipping next time.

tea leaves felt overly dry and had little taste

I've decided to end my dependence on coffee and decided to give Yerba Mate a try. Used one tea bag to start with and kept adding hot water to my cup throughout the day. I did not notice any miraculous pick-me up properties (for that, you need 2 tea bags), however, had no crashes either nor did it interfere with my sleep. Everything was going well until I went for a check up and discovered that my systolic blood pressure went up by over 25 points and diastolic - by 8. There were no lifestyle changes that I could recall, so my immediate suspect was Yerba Mate. I Googled the heck out of it and yes, consensus is that it can raise your blood pressure. I discontinued it immediately and my blood pressure is back to normal. Buyer beware.

I typically drink loose leaf Guayaki mate and thought i'd give these a try for convenience sake. Big mistake. I knew these were going to be weaker than loose leaf because i probably brew mine a little strong compared to some, so i tried starting out with 2 bags instead of just 1. It was so weak it barley even tasted like yerba mate, with TWO satchels. It also gave little to no energy/focus boost like loose leaf normally does. I guess i'll try 3-4 tomorrow and see how it comes out.I absolutely love Guayaki loose leaf, and so far hate these. Would not recommend.

I've been buying this brand of Yerba Mate for years & recently I couldn't find the smaller box so I had to buy this larger one.It does not taste like the real Yerba Mate & I e-mailed & called Guayaki, & they said they don't sell it in this size anywhere, & they don't sell on Amazon, so infer what you will, as my first review was already rejected.I just wasted my money on this product.

I followed the instructions to brew the tea to the dot, but all i tasted was the smell of yerba matte but not the flavor. The earlier order of the same product was a lot better and i could really feel the effects of yerba matte i.e improved cognition etc. For some reason, even after i let it seep for 15 minutes, all i could taste was hot water. I am really unhappy with the tea and have asked for refund which Amazon graciously did!!Thank you Amazon

I have been buying this same tea for years now and love it - normally. This last package did not taste right? It tasted like just a normal tea? And I did not finish using the 75 bags because towards the end, it tasted funky. The date code was 2019, but something was not right with this batch or something. I want to order again and I will add my comments. I hope this new batch is better.

Great tea,  I have been a long time consumer.  Great taste, but seller took great advantage of brief supply change issue.  I paid almost twice what I usually do in the grocery store.  Fortunately Yerba Mate is back in my store.  5 stars for the product and minus 3 for the seller.

I was super excited for this but I received it open and leaking everywhere. And I can’t return it.

Came Damaged and not offering, should have been big red flag.

There seem to be plentiful 5 star reviews for this product so I am in the minority. Either I got an off batch or my taste buds just don't care for this stuff. I also read articles that this product should not be consumed in large quantities because it could contribute adversely to your health due to an ingredient? I know you can't believe everything you read and if you moderate anything you consume it is always the wisest choice (goes without saying, I know...). But I'm just saying it is not for me. I will stick with black tea, green tea, and coffee.

Just like the title says.  I found the loose leaf to hardly give me any caffeinated effect, and it is all powder.  So it will leak out of your defuser/bag/etc.  I recently tried this brand and it is 10x better  https://www.amazon.com/Yerba-HI-CAFFEINE-CERTIFIED-Organic-SUPER-GREEN/dp/B0774VSX34/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/147-6205947-3778940?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0774VSX34&pd_rd_r=1e505d36-f4bc-4f10-b855-844021baffa9&pd_rd_w=Apa84&pd_rd_wg=LDtQD&pf_rd_p=6c927ef5-6938-465b-8f66-e5683dae7ef8&pf_rd_r=514ZBX60XWJGGXNVXG47&psc=1&refRID=514ZBX60XWJGGXNVXG47

No flavor. It makes the water yellow, that's the only way you can tell there's a tea bag in it.For Yerba Mate tea bags I'd suggest Rosamonte's Mate Cocido. Way more flavor.

I always beef it up with other things, chai spices, dark roast yerba mate, Korean herb tea, etc.It's a good thing it's so inexpensive because it takes 3 bags to make a decent cup of tea, even with additions.PS. March 2014. I bought a new order, hoping they improved the taste. It's worse. It's gotten more BITTER. So I would reduce rating to a 2 stars.

Great that it's organic. The bag easily tears, the Mate taste gross unless you drink it right after its brewed, like literally right after. Don't attempt to store this for more than an hour, it just becomes unpalatable. Forget this stuff and pick up a box of their Mate chocolate. Its good, not blow your mind good like Teavana, but I wouldn't mind drinking it if I had a box.

It gives me complete blindness for 45 second after 10 minutes when I took one cup of Guayaki tea.So, imagine if I start to drive my car after taking tea - I could be involved in a car accident in a way that is not intendedor planned.So I am not making Guayaki tea.It was waste of money.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Previous orders were fine, but this one was not😔

the packaging that the loose mate comes in had little tear near the top and bottom so it wasn't that fun to open. i had to put it in a different container after receiving. i guess its because its a biodegradable package and it was not meant to be thrown around in a box. other than that, every things good

This mate is okay the quality of the leaves is weak they last about two cup fulls before losing taste and if I leave a cup out for a day the damp leaves turn into this mucky dark smelly cluster. This hasn't happened with other brands of mate

I love the Yerba Mate Chocolate, but I'm not a fan of this tea. It has the smell of fresh cut grass. That's not a terrible smell, but not great for tea. I'm sure others might like this, but I had never tried it before I bought this big bag. My bad.

I didn't wanna wait a whole day for Amazon to send Eco so i bought this instead from whole foods. Weak. Powder and sticks. Picture clearly shows the difference.

GOOD PRODUCT, BUT HAS WAY EXSPENSIVE. PRICE KEEPS GOING UP?

I like the taste, and I like the effects.  However, this package was mostly powder.  Nearly HALF of it fell through my tea strainer into my glass.

Not impressed with the quality.  Powdery as opposed to bring a concmsistent leaf product.  Will not buy again.

Not the same product as the 25 bag edition.

The leaves are too small, kind of crushed and they are not strained by the bombillo.You definitely need to use a filter or a press strainer.

Tea is good, but I do not see any weight loss or energy benefits that were advertised.  Another gimmicky product.

it was ok but not what I expected.  Ordered a different Yerba Mate and it was much better

Not what I was expecting, I love the Yerba Mate Chocolate, drink it every day

It doesn't taste like the mate I'm used to. Very weak. And doesn't include the usual tee bag string to help with steeping

They taste pretty bad.. though that might be what maté tastes like.

More powder then leaves.. i have to filter out the powder ..

Did not work for my shoulder and neck pain, I tried to increase drinking more times of day and did nothing

Personal taste, didn't like the flavor. Too bitter.

This coffee taste like brown s***!

Taste was ok, but no "bubbles" (inactive)

It didn't make any difference

it is sour as hell

Bad after taste

cold brewed and still quite bitter. also made me feel gross. weird since i have bought the mint version before and done great.

Very mild tasting.

I think this was smoked because it tastes like a cigarette tray yuck!

I’m giving this 2 star to the Guayaki company (not the product) but because of the marketing campaign. I was born and raised in Paraguay and it’s extremely insulting to see people appropriating something so sacred to us! First of all IT IS NOT a product from Argentina or Brazil. It was originated in Paraguay during the first big war, where the tribes called Guayakí (emphasized the í) used the leaves of the Yerba mate because of the high hydration properties as they didn’t have access to clean water. Later on it was adopted by other cultures, also big part of Argentina and Brazil used to be all part of Paraguay called “Rio de la plata” under Spain rule. Terere and mate is extremely sacred to Paraguayans and the fact that they're the less credited is extremely insulting! Learn the culture first and they you can use them, we don’t mind you using them for profits but have some respect specially for a country where most people identifies as Guarani ancestry!

This is a ton of tea for what you pay for. It tastes great and I love the energy. However there were a lot of sticks and dust in my bag. With all this dust, how can it be fresh? It's dried to hell and back.

I have to note that I could have received a faulty product or this product uses a lower quality Yerba Mate. My opinion is based on trying "Guayaki Yerba Mate Organic Tea, 25-Count" (also from amazon but cost more) and the bottled drink version. Both of which gives me a powerful jolt of energy, it is more gradual then coffee but for people who don't consume caffeine regularly- you will feel it.I have been trying this on and off for about 2 months now. I can say with confidence that there is little to no caffeine compared to the other versions (same brand) I tried. Normally one tea bag would do the job and wake me up, however I have even used TWO teabags (supposedly 80 MG of caffeine) and feel nothing what-so-ever.The 2 stars are for :-The price point is great, the box of 25 tea bags cost more than this 75 tea bag. (This has me question the product even more)-The taste is relatively the same, if you are in it for the flavor then this works just fine for that. If you are looking for a better way to get your caffeine, I would not recommend this.

The first time I purchased, it was great! It was mostly all leaves.The 2nd had more stems and dust, thought it was a one off.  But this most recent purchase had so many stems and dust particles.

I’ll get straight to the point, this has decent caffeine kick but that’s about it. Mostly bitter, and only tolerable with ice cold water. If you’re after calming variety of Yerba, then avoid this. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, avoid this.There are much better brands like cruz de malta & playadito if you’re after milder variety.

This seller needs to either pack the product in a box (not envelope) to avoid damage or stop sending out broken bags. My bag had 2 holes in it and some of the tea was spilled.The taste is good but have nothing to compare with.Tea itself has a lot of dust and sticks but I suppose for better quality we must pay more. Oh, well. Next time.

The bag of tea was opened

Yerba Mates are great teas and I order all the time but do not care for their marketing at all.Yerba tea bags cost $2.30 an ounce which is expensive but a very good start. This five pounds of loose tea is sold for only $.47 an ounce. The cheapest green tea from china sells for $.60, not organic not Fair Trade which makes this tea an excellent healthy option in USDA organic form. Guayusa has a smoother taste than Yerba Mate. Any food item sold directly by Amazon, not a third party means fresh due to high turn over. This is an excellent price especially when competition sells this tea for $9 in a 8oz bag.The first people to discover Yerba Mate were the Guarani (pronounced wa-ra-nee). Their traditional homeland in Paraguay, northern Argentina, and southern Brazil overlaps the home range of wild yerba mate. I was born in a tea family. I drink over ten cups of tea every single day. I have been doing that for decades and decades. USDA organic, a certified USDA, Kosher, Fair Trade. Those three items ORGANIC, KOSHER, FAIR TRADE, guarantee a superior product, fair treatment of workers and environment. I drink many different teas and even the cheapest USDA organic, Kosher but not Fair Trade tea like Davidson's green tea sells for $10 a pound and once again not a Fair Trade ingredient. Amazon has great pricing. To get the most out of my tea, I do not treat these teas like I do with the real expensive teas since I drink so many cups of it every single day. Instead I make these teas in coffee percolator since I like my tea really hot and I hate waste. Percolator get all its colors out but I treat the black tea differently.A bite from a gnat, midge, mosquito or even an ant will normally cause a red lump with a hole in the middle -- this then turns itchy as the bite can provoke a mild allergy-like reaction. As a result chemicals called histamines are released into the surrounding skin, which is what gives us the maddening urge to itch. While bites themselves are rarely a problem, this itch can be, as scratching can break the skin and introduce infection that, in turn, leads to potential problems such as scarring. Steep a few teabags in boiling water for ten minutes, allow to cool and then apply the liquid to the sting site using a cloth. This helps to relieve inflammation as tannins in the tea are astringent, so reduce the swelling.Remember it is only a tea, there is no antioxidants, no youth, no energy, no nutritious stimulants except caffeine which is natural ingredient and all other miracles claimed by all those producers of Yerba Mate especially WEIGHT LOSS are all marketing tools. The only weight loss that I know of is exercise and cutting calories consumption unless one is truly genetically or chronically sick. These producers need to remove those claims since it is very misleading. Antioxidants are the most misused word in health and diet. There is not even a measurement of such ingredient called antioxidant in any food NUTRITION FACT table. It is a tea not a supplement either. I do not consume prescriptions for any chronic condition, supplements, pills, process foods. Only in US with relaxed laws these producers are allowed such marketing. I drink coffee as well as many black teas and none are supplements either except sugar free drinks. These are five star teas. Support those farmers through Fair trade or Fair for Life, certified programs and get yourself a nature given drink just like other plants that I use as tea when infact others only use as a food ingredient in their cooking but ignore the marketing.

The bag was punctured in the corner and made a mess.Tried to reach out with no success .$20 out the window

I like the flavor. Have seen 0 effects in blood sugar, alertness, or anything else.

When I received the package I immediately removed the Yerba Mate from the package and put it in a sealed container to keep it as fresh as possible. This is where I was first disappointed, the majority of the contents were basically powdered. Yerba Mate should be fine put not powdery. I had to step back because of the plume of powdery dust that filled the air as I was pouring it into my container. Already let down I tried to stay positive and continued on. Next I smelled the Mate like I would with any other type of tea to get more of an appreciation for the tea, again I was disappointed. This did not smell like the typical pure Mate's I get from local and online suppliers. Again, I tried to stay positive and remain hopefully that the taste would be the decider. The following morning I brewed some of the Mate, left it on the light side to make sure that I can fully appreciate the tea and adjust the quantity to my specific taste. Once again I was let down. With all other pure Mate's I have had in the past they had a grassy, light lemony/citrus taste to them (which I love). This has a roasted nutty and dark taste to it, not completely unpleasant but I do not seek out the taste.Overall I am extremely disappointed. The only reason it got a 3/5 instead of 2/5 is because the cost is so cheap that I don't feel like I wasted too much money on it. I would not suggest this product to a friend or family.

I like the Guayaki soda drinks. I take them to school for situations when I need a caffeine kick (like staying awake in a boring lecture). I bought the loose leaf version because I can control the sugar content of the drink. I found the flavor pleasant and mild. I know some reviewers are complaining about the taste - perhaps they used boiling water to steep the mate. If you use high temperature to steep the drink it will be bitter and awful. Also, some reviewer are complaining of the dusty residue. It does appear a couple of minutes after you steep the mate. It did not really bother me though. I would like to point out the the leaves themselves are not dusty. It's only after you steep them that you'll see the residue. The main issue that I have with the product is it puts me to sleep instead of keeping me awake. I started nodding off 10 minutes after I took the last sip during the first time I drank it. I thought it was an isolated incident then I tried a week after and I had the same result. Maybe the loose leaf version has some compounds that affect me a certain way - it is unfiltered and unrefined compared to the soda version. I'll keep buying the Guayaki soda drink for the caffeine. I just want to share my experience - it might have the same effect on you.

The only good thing about these is that they are portable. I use approximately 12-16 oz mugs, and need two bags for it to be a palatable strength when compared to loose leaf Rosamonte, which I usually allow to steep in a pot for several days.

I bought this expecting that it would taste similar to the cans or bottles of this same brand of Yerba Mate, but it does not at all. I wouldn’t say the flavor is all that appetizing, although it does not necessarily taste bad either. Pluses are it’s caffeine content and the large number of tea bags you get for the money.

The bag arrived with a tear and the loose leaf tea spilled out

I really enjoyed the yerba mate. Great taste and energy. Unfortunately the packaging was broken when I received it. A lot of it ended up on the floor due to a whole on the side of the bag.

Just introduced to Yerba Matte. Loved it so I ordered the loose tea. Taste is not very strong. I did it in a coffee press. Steeped 5 minutes.  Tried in a cup with almost boiling water poured over. And in my coffee maker as suggested. I’ll keep trying. I’ll update if I can get it more taste.

This stuff is just fine as yerba mate, but you're paying a premium for the brand name while gaining nothing in terms of flavor, effect, etc. I have no problem spending a bit more if it gets me a higher quality product, but in this case it's on par with significantly cheaper options, and in some cases is actually a bit worse.For example, you could pay $14 for 1lb of Guayaki... or you could pick up 2.2lbs of Canarias for $14.15, 2.2lbs of Taragui for $14.20, 2.2lbs of Cruz de Malta for $13.40, etc. All of these are as good as Guayaki, and I think Taragui is actually better.

I'm having tummy trouble,  this tea was recommended to me by several people, but so far nothing is helping.

Though I love mate and I drink it from the traditional gourd, I get it in tea bag form for the convenience. I've bought it before and no complaints, this time however I got a package that was not vacuum sealed and was beat up to all hell. Even some of the tea bags are broken, there goes the convenience factor. Just be wary who you buy from.

The bag was ripped. I noticed other reviewers said the same. Had less flavor than the bag I purchased from the grocery store. I did a smell comparison and this product had much less scent than the store bought package.

The taste is lovely. I mix mine like how I drink my coffee. I would give the product 5 stars!But I'm not sure who is coming up with the price! I'd recommend everyone take a look locally first. Amazon would be last option. These bags started off around $7 and its crept its way to $15 2/27/16

I actually love this tea....drink it everyday, often twice.  Unfortunately, this package was delivered in a very distressed state, very little air inside.  Almost like it had been vacuum packed.  The tea leaves have been broken down so that much of the package is a very fine dust.  Dust is always an issue with this product, but this is almost undrinkable unless one were to strain it with cheesecloth.

This yerba mate isn't that great when compared with other mate distributors.  I bought a pound from Island Teas and it tastes and feels a lot better than this.  Yerba Mate is a great tea but this product doesn't do it justice.  Get the real thing and put it through a coffee maker, cool, and add sugar if you want a good drink.

The package arrive on time and in good order.  The yerba tastes as expected, but the quality was not.  This yerba is full of stems, chunks, and loads of yerba dust.  (I found one stem that was almost 3 inches long)  Maybe it is like this because it is "traditional", but I don't care for it.  I will go back to Eco Teas organic yerba.  Your taste may vary, as all do.

After using the Guayaki bagged Yerba Mate varieties, I had high hopes for this. I prefer loose Yerba Mate, brewing it in a basket in a large mug with hot (never boiling) water. I don't know if was something with the specific lot that my bag came from, but it's been less flavorful than I'm used to. Second brewings were particularly weak, something else that I don't expect from a quality Yerba Mate.

A bit more powdery than I would have expected for a Mate, about 1/3 of it is as finely ground as a matcha! Also, not sure if this is a different type than the 5 other traditional mates that I have had, but it seemed REALLY grassy and green tasting... almost to the point that I'm wonding if there is grass in there... not a bad tea though.

Pretty good stuff, but I prefer more smokey flavor.  Compared to Tadin Yerba Mate for instance, this has more of a "green" taste.  I prefer the flavor of Tadin, but since they do not offer theirs loose I will probably try some of the other offerings from Guayaki once I finish this bag.

It certainly has a different pick me up feeling than coffee.  I prefer not drinking on a regular basis but instead occasionally.  The aroma dry is similar to a cut hayfield or prairie grass in the fall and I imagine the flavor similar.

Great price and taste but WTF? One of the reviewers says it can cause cancer, and I went online and sure enough I read that scientists studied it and yes apparently it has caused cancers. I wish I had known that before ordering. Anyway, I brewed some up and it sure is delicious. But now I'm afraid to drink it.

It smells like hay.....I have to add lots of sweetener to balance it out. However, since I heard that it's a better alternative than coffee, I forced myself to drink it plain haha. *sigh* the things I do sometimes.

I have used this brand for a long time and enjoyed it. I like the taste it produces. However, I eventually tired of all the dust it contains and the mess that makes in the cup (and sink). So, I have stopped using it. You might find it to your liking. It includes stems and such and is finely ground--almost a powder.

These tea bags are not foil lined and air tight - probably kinder to the planet but I wonder if they will preserve the flavor of the tea as well.

Okay this tea does boost your energy and make u regular but it tastes so nasty. It actually made me a little nauseous had to add lots of lemon and splenda and it was still gross. If you can stand the taste it does do what it says it does.

this tea is marketed as tea bags. when i received my shipment it was loose tea. same quality and taste just no bags you have to use a tea ball or something to seep it in

Not the same buzz that I get from the 16ounce Lemon Elation Yerbas of the same brand.  Not even close, even using 3 tea bags.

VERY dusty. Good flavor and everything else considered it was good, but it is so dusty and lots of stems. I am going to go back to other brands I have found here on Amazon.

Does not taste the same !

I like it, it's loaded with caffeine but research shows it causes mouth, esophageal and other cancers if consumed too much.. not like a green tea.

The flavor of this tea is good, but there are better. Also, it contained a lot of twigs and tiny leaf fragments that frequently clogged my bombilla. My favorite brand is Mate Factor. Eco Teas is cheaper and still very good. And they don't clog my bombilla :)

I haven't tried any other Yerba Mate but it has a smokey kind of flavor. It isn't the best tea but everything is an acquired taste in one way or another. Will continue using.

Definitely have tasted better. Very bland yet smokey. Not what I was looking for.

Pretty dusty, which is quite annoying if you are using a tea strainer for anything else, since it's hard to clean. Make sure to brew this with about 170-180F water, not boiling water, unless you like your mate excessively smokey.

Disappointed, This is good quality Mate, but I like Yerba Mate strong like drinking from a gourd. Unfortunately this is more the strength of green tea.

The tea tastes great but you need a real fine strainer to strain it with. A lot of the fine pieces get through my ordinary tea strainer and you do eat some of the tea.

Taste is funky, good amount of product for price. Probably wont get it again, it was a nice try though.

Good flavor but it does have some stems good price.

A taste that is different form any tea i have tried, not sure i would by this type of tea again

It arrived on time and was as advertised. My only issue is with the product itself. It is a really, really mild blend. I prefer the bolder mate's. However it may make a nice TERERÉ

Poor quality tea bags prevented a higher rating.  Many bags were not closed well and leaked contents.

Liked it but the tea bags produced weaker tea than the 25 count

Tastes great but expensive.

I like the tea okay but it is fantastic with sugar or honey, both of which I cannot have.  I does make great iced tea as well.

Tasted ok, i expected more I guess

Nice tea. Nothing special or maybe I missed something????

First Yerba Mate experience. So far so good, but the price is only OK for the amount

Taste is Horrible  :(

I recently tried the Yerba Mate Tea and was pleasantly surprised by its rich flavor and energizing properties. The taste is robust and earthy, providing a perfect pick-me-up for any time of day.One thing I appreciate about this tea is its high quality and authenticity. As a fan of traditional South American beverages, I can attest to the genuine flavor and aroma of this Yerba Mate.The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the tea bags fresh and preserving their flavor. However, the only downside I found was the lack of a string for easy removal of the tea bag. While it's a minor inconvenience, having a string attached would make the brewing process more convenient, especially when using a mug or cup.Overall, I would still highly recommend this Yerba Mate Tea for its taste, quality, and energizing effects. It's a great addition to any tea lover's collection, despite the small drawback of the missing string.

Yerba Mate is a fantastic pick-me-up! It provides a smooth, sustained energy boost without the jitters. The flavor is earthy and refreshing—perfect for a morning ritual or an afternoon lift. Highly recommend!

Great tea, it was a little “too” loose for my tea strainer ball, but it did the job. Good with honey!

It’s great for the price but the only flaw is that it doesn’t come with the little string to pull it out afterwards

Let me first say that I am nowhere near a yerba mate "sommelier" so if your looking for "it has fruity notes and hints of mushrooms and unicorn fluff" that is not going to come from this reviewer.  What I will comment on first is ease of use:  Drop two bags in my large coffee cup put a little water on it then swirl to get the teabags wet (dummy water thing) and let sit for about a minute.  Then put the 170 degree or so water on it.  let it steep.  Enjoy. When you finish, you can put another round of water on it to get a weaker cup (I have gone three rounds on the two bags but prefer to end it at two YMMV).Effects:  As you have read or may not have read, this stuff has a caffeine content above tea but below coffee and has other components involved here as well (Theobromine et.al) so as a life long coffee drinker I can tell you that this will produce a much more elegant buzz that what Mistress Coffee provides.  I feel alert, focused, and very awake without the shakes and stomach upset that coffee sometimes does to the drinker.  I can also tell you that my appetite doesn't go away but I'm not digging thru my desk looking for snack machine change.  I can hold out till lunch.  The after effects are minimal.  I dont crash as hard (if you want to call it crash now) as you do when coffee wears off.  It "ramps up then gently ramps back down"  Which is why I suppose folks drink the stuff in a weaker form all day long.  You keep getting weaker and weaker doses so that you gently come back down.  Does it have the same "gotta go to the potty" effect as coffee...kinda...sorta...not as pronounced.In conclusion:  If you are like me and trying to wean off the coffee and tea just isn't cutting it, this is a very good way to get introduced into the world of yerba mate without all the ritual stuff that you see associated with yerba mate (that slurping sound that is popular with the gourd/bombilla/knit cap in the middle of summer crowd drives me freaking nuts!).  If you like it then you can buy all the stuff and stand on the corner with a gourd or use a french press like I plan on doing.Enjoy your mate.

I am fairly new to Yerba Mate and like Guayaki's offerings. Their cans of mate are great and I have consumed many of them. I have also recently moved to traditional preparation: using a gourd and bombilla. I think this is fun although you have to get accustomed to the taste which is pretty strong and bitter--at first. However, I have found that the taste is acquired.My wife and I really like mate. Guayaki's products are probably pretty comparable to "top of the line." However, there ARE cheaper alternatives like Eco Teas, which is also organic and fair trade (whatever that means ...  I should look it up). I am going to review what I think are the PROS and CONS of mate AS A FORMER ENERGY DRINK CONSUMER (I'll never go back).My OWN experience:PROS--Mental alertness enhanced--Awakens me and actually makes me feel energetic (AS OPPOSED TO jittery and wired)--Enhances my mood. Let me elaborate: I am more introverted than not. When I have consumed some mate I actually feel more positive and inclined to smile and say hi to people, even across a room. I have really liked that.--I feel the claims to "aids elimination" are true. Things tend to keep moving as they should!CONS--Makes my urine smell. :) Like unto asparagus, I have noticed that drinking mate adds a certain ... smell ... to urine. Don't get me wrong though, not a big deal! Just kind of funny and would, well, technically fall under "cons."--The primary thing: I have seemed to notice that if I go a day and a half or so without drinking it I develop a headache. (I DID NOT personally get this with energy drinks for whatever reason.) I am currently doing a experiment to determine if mate "withdrawal" is, in fact, the reason. I'll have to update this later with what I have found.That's the main reason I brought it from five stars down to four. I don't like ANYTHING that creates or causes any form of bodily dependence. I spoke of my headaches to a friend of mine, an avid mate drinker, and he also told me, "Oh yeah, If I were to stop drinking mate I'd have a headache for a week!"Hope the review helps!

I ordered this product b/c after doing some research online for safe supplements to incorporate into my workout I read a blog that more than made mention of the positives of this "tea." I like tea, but I have never been a fanatic about it. The blog stated that the actual loose tea from South America is both inexpensive and POTENT (meaning strong in the effect) vs. the tea sold in the states. I just looked this up on Amazon, saw this was loose tea, it was only $11 (& change + $5 in S&H) so I gave it a whirl. I brew it in my coffee pot, & I usually will circulate it through twice to increase the strength of it. I'll set it up at night (while I'm awake) & brew the first pot, & then prior to going to bed I put the tea back in the reservoir, & set the "Brew Delay" to begin at about 3:45am in the morning before I get up & get ready to go workout. It works well for my digestive system, gives me energy w/out the crash, & I'll add some sugar free French vanilla creamer & Stevia to it sometimes just to give it a little creaminess that makes it "yummy" (for me). The downside to brewing this in your coffee pot is that if you fill up your reservoir for 12 cups of coffee - by the time it finishes brewing you will be down to about 10 (I surmise it is due to the absorption from the dry loose tea sitting in the filter). I am on my 2nd bag in less than 2 weeks, but then again, I am quite active and many times I work at a clinic during the day and then out of a fire dpt at night as a Paramedic so I like to sip it throughout the duration of the day (depending on my schedule). It also doesn't give me a "sour stomach" (when empty) like coffee does. I'd recommend giving it a try!! ...& the shipping was pretty fast!

If you've never had yerba mate before, this might be a little overkill for you since it is 75 bags of the stuff. Try a smaller count option first if you want to get some mate (you don't want to get stuck with 74 bags of something you hate). If you love mate and don't do loose leaf, this is a great option.For people just getting into mate, this is a great option because it is in bags and not loose leaf. Also good for having some mate at work or on the go because you don't have to have a little gourd stuffed with steaming hot water and a handful of mate with a bombilla.There are better tasting mates out there, but this is a very good option for the price and quantity. 75 bags!? You won't find many options out there with that many bags for this price. They are not individually wrapped, so you might get a little dust from the bag, but that's partly contributed to the lower cost since they don't have to package each little bag. Additionally, the tea bags are just that, tea bags. No strings or little tabs to lift the tea bag out. If you hate that, Guayaki makes individually wrapped tea bags with strings, they're just a little more expensive. Not much though, since Guayaki is the more affordable tea bag option for mate. If you're super serious about mate, loose leaf will always be the cheapest option. I've got a 500 gram bag of Rosamonte that I've been working on for the past 3-4 months at work (at ~3g per serving, that's ~167 servings, 30 servings a month, the bag will last just over 5 months).ProsPrice and quantity are greatTaste is goodBagged, not loose leafConsNo string or tab on the bagsNot individually wrappedNot the greatest mate known to man (but still good)

Was going to to give this as a gift with the cup.  The tea package was delivered in a box with a lot of other items and not sure if that caused a hole or if it already had a hole.  I was unable to give it as a gift, so using the tea myself. It is good.

I don't know how the tea is, but it arrived with a hole in the bag, loose leaf coming out, and I just tried to file a return online, says item cannot be returned. I mean, how fresh is it with a hole in the bag? Ugh. UPDATE: Seller reached out to me with a refund.

This is great green tea that I've bought a couple of times!  I used to be a sucker who purchased large amount of loose Yerba Mate at my local tea store for ridiculous prices.  I took a chance and bought this tea from Amazon, and was not disappointed.  I'm not enough of a tea expert to really understand the whole free trade process, but I do know organic is a good thing.  Now, my old expensive tea did have a better taste, but I've learned to appreciate this tea's earthy taste.  I like to mix green and black tea together, and have found that this tea will overpower the brew.  For the price, I'll live with that!  This tea alone will give you a good morning boost without the jittery feeling, but add some black tea and you'll be flying high!

If you like your tea earthy and aren't put off by a bit of "sludge" at the bottom of your cup, this is for you.  I cheat a bit and put dehydrated orange peels in my storage containers to spark up the flavor.  I know that's not for those that take the "traditional" to heart but that's the way that mate was first offered to me and I've continued the practice.  I'm normally a strong black coffee drinker and while I continue to prefer coffee as my stimulant of choice, mate is a great change up.  The "kick" is a bit more subtle than strong coffee and in my opinion seems to not have some of the less desirable side effects (acid stomach, jitters, etc).  Expect this particular version of mate to give good value and meet or even exceed standards as long as you aren't looking for a tea bag clarity in your drink.

I had heard yerba mate was a good substitute of coffee.  Nothing like coffee but it is a really nice cup of tea.  I really enjoyed.

I love the taste of this mate, I love the company and what it stands for, protecting the enviornment & supporting organic farmers, the price here on amazon is really great, I took away one star only because most of my tea leaves were reduced to a very fine powder.  This was my second loose tea leaf purchase (I normally buy tea in bags) and the other loose leaf I bought (different brand, different site) had no fine powder.  So when I make the tea I get a lot of powder in my cup.  Not a huge deal, but I would prefer if the leaves were big enough not to leak through.  I'll probably buy this one more time & if I get the same thing I'll go back to the guayaki mate tea bags, which I love, I just wish they sold in bulk because I run out so quickly!!

The tea came spilling out of its bag:( though am still happy to receive the item! Smells great!

I love to make mate tea and having found this in Amazon was a blessing.  They are separate tea bags in a foil package that keeps them fresh.  I usually use two tea bags when I make my mate, but it still lasts a long time.  The tea tastes great and not bitter.  But of course, it all depends on the brewing time so keep that in mind.  The longer you brew it results in bitterness.  Also, the temperature of water also is a factor that can affect the taste.  I heat the water until its just about to boil.  That is the temperature that prevents the bitter taste.  Try this and enjoy it!

Tastes good. Not seeing or feeling energy part.

Light to mild on taste, great flavor. But this particular type (mate tea bag) is not necessarily my cup-of-tea.  Catch my joke.  Lol.  So far I've tried Cruz de Malta which I love😍 and now Guayaki in tea bag form.  In comparison, I feel as though, I must add 7-8 Guayaki tea bags just to equal strength of one brew from Cruz de Malta.  On my part, I haven't done any digging to see if Guayaki comes in brew form, if so, I'd probably prefer that over the tea bag form.Happy mate drinking everyone!  JoE =)

I drink mate every day.  I tried the Guayaki unsmoked and this at the same time.  I like this one better.  It's got a great taste with good packaging and good delivery speed.  I'm going to try others, but I suspect I'll be back to this exact one once I look around.  One mild complaint: it's ground pretty small.  I keep having to wipe off/clear my straw thingy (edit: I couldn't let that ignorance stand.  I meant bombilla).  The other kind I tried didn't have that problem.  Even so, I'm very happy with it and look forward to my morning mate every day.

Recommended by a friend and told that it tasted like grass.  To me it does, which is fine. I don't care for it with sweetener. Highly sensitive to caffiene, I used less than half of tea- so I'm probably missing out. Still, I like it.  Earthy, fresh. It's not "white bread" tea, and after reading reviews, was not surprised at the difference in texture.  One could always try snorting it.  Shipping was not good at all. Received 2 items in a box way too big, with 2 little air pillows, so tea was everywhere.  Not the products fault.  I get to experience a gentle pick me up with this tea, it's good hot and cold.  Thanks for all the reviews.

I didn't know what to expect. This is my first time purchasing loose leaf tea but this was better than expected. The powdered part gets through the little holes on my metal tea steeper.The packaging keeps it fresh and it has a strong flavor which to me means that it's not old.Only thing I wish they had was a resealable bag.Is you know your teas I  would recommend it.

I purchased this larger bag for a really great price. I've been buying a bag half the size for almost $11 at a health food store near me. Made the switch to yerba mate after Coffee started upsetting my stomach. I use two tea bags with honey and it seems to be almost the same as coffee. Trusted brand. Will continue to purchase.

Pleasant flavor, tried it for the first time. Doesjustice to me by keeping me awake and productive during the day without the gitters that I get from drinking coffee.I prefer to cold brew the tea and let it sit overnight in cold water and drink it in the morning and it get me going during the day.

Good mate. Not the most earthy flavor out there, but for prepackaged tea, it's delicious. I drink it daily and definitely notice a decrease in efficacy after extended use ... so I'll cut it off and then return. Mate is a great substitute for coffee and I happen to really enjoy the flavor. Some folks think it tastes like dirt, but I am not one of them, as I'm a fan of puh er tea as well.

I typically order tea in small portions, 100 grams at a time.  But a full pound?!  This is great stuff, but keep in mind you will get a FULL POUND of tea.  At two cups per morning, this will last a long time.  Ensure you use a very fine tea strainer or you will end up with lots of sediment at the bottom of your cup.  If you are using a Bombilla, its not even an issue.  Great stuff

Enjoy Mate tea (great caffeine boost without the coffee crash) and have tried a few different brands. Bought this brand as a loose leaf and enjoyed it, but found it difficult to use due to the ingredients were often difficult to keep out of the liquid. These work great and still get the same flavor and the bonus convenience of ease of use. Unless I find a better brand will likely keep these at home and in the office.

My new diet doesn't let me do coffee anymore but hasn't cured my insomnia, so here we are. Flavor is alright. Energizing properties are just okay. No heart burn like coffee as well, so thats cool.

Guayaki is the most common brand of maté on the market, and I bought it because of the good deal here.  Although there are more traditional brands out there with a much finer grind.  Other than that, I love maté. I totally kicked my coffee habit without really even trying. It gives you an alert feeling, but much different than from coffee- you won't be jittery at all.  Great for elimination, but totally not like a laxative at all.  Make it as strong as you possibly can!

Reminds me of green tea.  The tea bags have very fine powder in them, so there's grinds in the bottom of your cup.  I think I should have gone with loose leaf and steeped in myself.

I've been looking for affordable bagged Mate for a while, and this product is the perfect answer. Has the same flavor you'd expect from most unblended Mate, but in individual bags rather than loose. Great for travel or when you don't want another thing to clean. More than anything the price on Amazon is superb for 75 bags.The only downfall is they lack of strings on the bags, which may put some people off.

If you want the taste of Yerba Mate without the fuss of using the traditional gourd cup and strainer straw, then this product provides what you want--though the flavor is not as intense as the traditional brew.

It's alright. The taste is earthy and the caffeine level is average... seems on par with home-steeped green tea regarding caffeine. But take this with a grain of salt, I have a higher tolerance so if you know you're sensitive then it will probably affect you way more!!

bought this for a present and it was a good price vs what you pay in a store.

I bought this as a recommendation for energy and weight loss.  The contents are so finely processed you need to treat them like a coffee in a brewer than as a tea in an infuser as much of it will just end up in your cup or mug.  The shipper dI'd ship promptly and it arrived with only a couple of days instead of weeks.

Good tea. Too bad it has almost doubled in price. Will be looking for another variety.

I purchase this tea in hopes of finding something that could give me a jolt of caffeine without the associated reflux that I always get. I've heard it said that this tea is perfect to drink for that very purpose.... unfortunately, I got reflux just the same :(Back to caffeine pills for me.

I bought this tea to use for an "energy drink" recipe in a magazine.  Not so sure I would like the tea so well on its own, but I combine it with other teas for the caffeine and enjoy it.  I don't think I have seen it anywhere near this price.

I found this a pleasant substitute for the coffee and teas I've been drinking for a lifetime.  I just add coconut/almond milk to it and enjoy it.

Good stuff. My only issue is that the amount of tea in the bags seemed somewhat inconsistent. Every few bags I would pull one out and it would have noticeably less tea than the others. I've since bought a bag of the Guayaki loose leaf yerba mate and I like it better all around.

The caffeine content is not too distinct from a regular bagged Green Tea. I didn’t get the “fresh, natural” tea taste from it.

Will buy from seller again

Love this tea however I ordered 2 loose leaf tea and only received 1 16 oz the other was tea bags please send other I paid for thank you

This tea tastes pretty close to regular green tea. I didn't notice any huge increase in my energy, which has been suggested in some articles. Still, tea is generally good for health so I'll continue to drink it. I prefer this served with ice instead of hot.

Used it to make Kombucha, works well but I would not drink it hot, by it's self, tried it once, very bitter.

The tea has good depth of flavor and is smooth. I am enjoying it very much

Good value and goo Yerba Mate.  I use it to help with lung function and it seems to do the trick, Yerba Mate is known for having Theobromine.  It also gives a slight sustained energy boost which is nice

Taste is good, flavorful. The bags does not have holding string, so you will have to submerge them and take them out with a spoon (a little inconvenient). The container bag breaks really easily, I end up putting them in a zip lock bag.

Good stuff. I got what I ordered. I prefer yerba mate over any other energy drink.

I've never had this tea before but the flavor is very mild.

Started drinking it after hearing Tim Ferris drinks Yerba Mate.  This had good reviews which is why I chose this brand.I measure my blood sugar often and test what effects various foods and drinks have on it. - I'm prediabetic and trying to reverse it.  If I drink this tea alone on an empty stomach it will lower my blood sugar by approximately 14 points over the course of the following hour from when I first start sipping it.  For example, I would go from 100 down to 86. If I drink it with a meal it seems to suppress my blood glucose values slightly compared to when I eat the same food without drinking the Yerba Mate.I have consumed hundreds of cups over the last year or so and it has never once made me jittery.  The most I would have in a day is probably 2 tea bags.  I typically have 2 cups of decaf coffee first thing in the AM, then I have a cup or two of this tea after that.I will use one bag twice if I am having a second cup right after the first one.  The second cup will obviously be a little weaker but it is still satisfying.The tea seems to help calm me and focus me and help me get into "the zone" when I am doing creative work.  The effect is not strong.  It is very subtle.  So, don't drink it expecting a dramatic relaxation effect.I absolutely love the flavor.  It is very mild in my opinion.  To me it seems like the texture of the tea is almost as if you had a very small amount of butter in the tea cup.  (Not the taste of butter - just the texture - like silky almost)  I think it is just lovely.I have not been able to source this locally.  Someone local probably sells it but I haven't found it yet.  So I always buy it through Amazon.  It always arrives promptly in good condition.The large foil bag that these tea bags ship in is easy to tear.  You will probably want to have an airtight container of some kind to store your tea bags in.  The bag they ship in will probably end up tearing wide open on you before you get half way through the bag.I strongly recommend this tea.  Drinking this has become a daily habit for me.  At this point it looks like a permanent habit too assuming the quality never diminishes and assuming the price remains affordable.

UPDATED AS OF 3/3/24I had to chime in to dispel some of the intensely inaccurate reviews on here, in terms of what yerba mate is and isn't, and its benefits.First, technically yerba mate is an herb, not a tea, as it is not from the camellia family.  It's actually related to holly.Second, it contains vitamins, minerals, and more antioxidants than green tea (contrary to one misguided reviewer on here claiming that yerba only yields caffeine, which is not even close to the truth.)Yerba mate contains caffeine, theophylline (vasodilator) and theobromine (found in chocolate), but most who drink it find they do not experience the jitters, acid stomach or other negative aspects of coffee or green tea, myself included.I have found that yerba acts as a natural asthma medication for me, keeping my lungs open and giving me an energetic boost without feeling hyper, sweaty or keeping me from sleeping. In fact, I often take yerba before bed to keep the lungs happy all night and sleep like a baby. I cannot consume coffee or any tea (black or green) after noon and sleep at all, not even one cup. So clearly yerba is a special herb.It brews well in tea bags, in a traditional gourd and bombilla setup or in a French press.  Apparently in South America, they have it cold and brewed in fruit juice and similar things for a refreshing summer beverage. I cannot wait to try that! I've made yerba overnight in the fridge, cold-brewed, and it was delicious. Strong, but not bitter at all.Just wanted to correct some misinformation on here and share some of the reasons why yerba mate has been a treasured part of my life for 3 decades and counting!Original Review:I was introduced to Guayaki Yerba Mate by a tenant of mine in Los Angeles. He used to chuck a few tea bags into his 1.5 liter water bottle, shake it up and sipped it throughout the day for energy and the lovely flavor. I tried it and have been a huge devotee ever since. I like it sweetened with a touch of liquid stevia and I brew mine quite strong (so strong, you cannot see through the water, lol) because I adore the rich, smokey flavor which only seems to deepen when you add a little sweetness. I also noticed that while I do feel a little energy lift from it, I never feel jittery nor has it ever disrupted my sleep when I drink it in the evening. It honestly seems to help my digestion as well, I feel like it kindles the digestive flames somehow, but that might just be my own experience.Wonderful flavor, unobtrusive energy and a healthy substitute for coffee or "energy drinks".

No complaints with this tea. It doesn't pack a strong punch like coffee does as it's relatively low caffeine for this blend.

Bought this to preserve my dopamine neurons when I was using opiates. Seemed to help only the first day or so. But when I drank this tea and used opiates I was consistently using the same amount and could think better. Good taste and smell. Smooth quality. fresh taste. Will buy again soon.

I bought this as a recommendation for coffee substitute that wouldn't stain my teeth. I also purchased some Red Rooibos as well to compare the two. I have to say that while I did enjoy the Red Rooibos, it had that very distinct tea flavor, and just didn't quite hit the spot.The Yerba Mate came in a few days later, so yesterday was the first time I got to try it as a morning coffee substitute. While again, it's not going to taste like coffee, this stuff was much more like green tea, which isn't bad either, but definitely not like coffee.  I normally add a bit of heavy cream to my coffee, so I did that as well, and found I enjoyed it much more that way.Claims that the smaller amount of caffeine being enough (95mg in coffee vs 40mg in this product), held true for me, as well as the claim that it felt more like a consistent energy, rather than the hard hit that coffee can give, and then fades.Yesterday I had to get up at 5:30 am and drive 2 hours to get to a 4 hour conference. I then had to run a bunch of errands, followed by a 2 hour drive home. After 6 hours of sleep, things didn't seem promising. However, I found that I really wasn't very tired at all throughout the day, and it wasn't until around 3-4, after eating a solid meal, that I kind of started feeling the energy drain, but I was still pretty good all the way up to my evening exercises, after which, I just crashed, but it was 10 pm by then.So, given the initial trial run, I'd say the Yerba Mate IS a good substitute. Granted, it could be a whole fluke of a day, but for now, my opinion is that the taste is pleasant, and the slow and steady energy buzz is actually preferable to coffee. As far as claims of being a mild appetite suppressant, I haven't noticed that.Just a final heads up: a quick Google shows that there's a lot of pros and cons about Yerba Mate, including that it's better for you than coffee, with lots of vitamins and nutrients and anti inflammatory effects,  but also studies saying it can put you at a higher risk for some cancers if too much is ingested. I honestly haven't looked very far into it, but will be doing so once I'm done with this. Just so you know!UPDATE: Oct. 7, 2019 - Yerba Mate has consistently held up as a caffeine substitute for me. I now drink 2 tea bags added to 16 oz hot water and about 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream in the morning. My energy levels are comparable to coffee, and I'm usually not hungry till 11-12pm. I got this because it's not supposed to stain your teeth like coffee does, and I can say my teeth haven't stained any.

After doing research on black and green tea (real tea), I discovered that fluoride in the tea were actually at unsafe levels.  And that this could POTENTIALLY mean bad news for bones, teeth, and brain function.  I will leave you to do your own research on that, as I am generally NOT a worrier about such things (so I know how frustrating it is to hear yet another possible health risk.)  Still (obviously) I saw enough reason to be at least "concerned" at the levels of fluoride in black and green (and decaf) tea.  This led me to two new products: White Tea and Yerba Mate.Yerba Mate is a loose leaf traditional (south american) tea-like product that comes in many different forms.  And it doesn't have high concentration of fuoride in its leaves.  So, I tried it.I heard that it tastes "grassy" or like hay.  Some say it taste earthy.  To be sure, it doesn't taste like green or black tea (but more like green than like black).  It is unique.  I didn't find it "grassy."  I found it to have a pleasant, non-bitter taste.  Not like tea, as I said, but pleasant enough.I prepared it by putting it in my Mr. Coffee coffemaker.  FIrst batch tasted like coffee a bit.  I cleaned the coffee maker and tried again.  This time i got a pleasant brew.  I tried to make it STRONGER, the next time and I found no real difference.  So, I went back to normal brew.  It will look a little like green tea in looks, but it's unique taste was unmistakeable. I enjoyed it. My wife complained it had an odd taste.  However, my wife is self-proclaimed picky eater.  Even if she loves some recipe/item, then later finds out it has XYZ (whatever item she doesn't think she likes) then see will change her mind and never eat that food that she said that she loved.  All that to say this: If you are AOK with knowing this will have a unique taste, then you may just find it a good drink for you. If you are pretty picky about tastes that are new, then you likely will not like it.For me, I have to give it 5 stars.  Oh, to be sure, I like White Tea better than Yerba Mate, but it is a good product and worthy of 5 stars.

I put in glass teapot cold overnight and I drink it all day. I love it!

I used to work at a tea house and this was the brand that most people loved drinking and it was very popular with taste when added with soy, honey and sugar. Even better if you can find mint syrup to add and taste amazing.

Just as good as I remember. More convenient than the traditional but they sell loose mate as well. I really like the flavor, but I don’t drink enough mate to know how it compares to other brands.

This is my favorite loose-leaf yerba so far. It has a potent amount of caffeine, coupled with a chocolatey after-taste. Guayki is the best :D

Heard about Yerba Mate on the Huberman Podcast. My coworkers and I are enjoying it.

My first introduction to Yerba Mate was a roommate telling me that the stuff is "crazy" and will keep you more awake than energy drinks or coffee. He bought the stuff as an iced tea from Whole Foods. I tried it and it did provide an energy boost, but not a "crazy" one.After some research, I found out that as a ballpark figure, Yerba Mate provides ~1/3 (one third) of the caffeine of a cup of coffee. That's perfect for me, since I don't always want as much caffeine as a full cup of coffee, but I do want *some.* I did some research, and it turns out they don't just sell it at Whole Foods in pre-made iced tea. So I bought it on Amazon.== Taste ==Yerba Mate has a smoky flavor to it. If you like drinking green tea or other teas without adding lots of sugar, you'll like this tea.== Price point ==... is absolutely ridiculous -- you get 75 tea bags. That lasts a long time.== No string attached ==If it's an issue for you, the tea does come in bags, but it doesn't have a string for easily pulling out the bag. It's really not very difficult to pull it out with a spoon, but it is worth mentioning since most people are used to having a string attached to their tea bags.== Good hot or cold ==At first, I had this tea mostly hot-brewed, and it was quite good. But recently, my girlfriend and I have started adding about 5-10 bags to a large pitcher of water and letting it soak in the fridge for at least 12 hours. It tastes **awesome.** So while Yerba Mate is good for hot tea, it is even better for cold tea. Some teas just taste better cold -- actually, that's true of food in general. Some things taste better hot; some better cold. Black tea is the one most commonly used in iced teas, like Snapple. You can drink it warm, but it's far more popular cold.I highly recommend this product, and I also highly recommend that you try using it to brew iced tea.

I drink a cup of the tea every day. Tasts great and only a tablespoon serving. It just costs more than in the store but the store is almost an hour away so I have to buy it online.

I learned about yerba mate in Argentina, and bought Argentine Yerba, mate, and bombilla.  I later found out that Yerba is paraguayan. This product is.  The quality is also high (almost pure leaf, did not see any stems)

I really like this tea. When I feel down, I warm up this tea and it helps to boost my energy levels and mood. It is very concentrated to make lots of cups and it’s good to add cream and share with family.

Everyone loves coffee but few people are as dedicated to the craft of finding and enjoying caffeine as I am. After having downed energy drinks twice a day for a few years, switching to coffee to try to get an equal, albeit uneven, fix, I'm happy to have found yerba mate tea.What I love most about the Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea is the elevated feel and focus the tea provides through its 40 mg of caffeine per bag without the traditional shaky hands and anxiety I would get from coffee and energy drinks. It's a buzz without being a wreck.For comparisons, Starbucks coffee (venti Americano) doses you with about 300 mg of caffeine though independent reports I've seen have shown it to be upwards of 400 mg+ depending on where you go. Energy drinks typically range from 77 mg (8 oz Red Bull) to 240 mg per can (16 oz Rockstar Zero Carb) with added, and unnecessary to get you going, things like taurine that are questionable for your health.With yerba mate tea, you can stack your caffeine to your content. Want the buzz of an energy drink without the nerves? Put four bags in and let it steep for 10 minutes. Works like a charm every time for me.It's worth noting that the U.S. government recommends not consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine per day so going overboard with two ventis from Starbucks or two Rockstars can have potential consequences. Beyond the simple enjoyable taste of yerba mate, the stackable nature is what I enjoy most.For the price, you can't go wrong! Four bags (160 mg of caffeine) gets you close to 19 cups of tea. When you compare that to $4 for a venti Americano or $3 for an energy drink, it's pretty apparent that yerba mate is also the more economical choice of the three.Check out energy fiend dot com to get the scoop on caffeine levels in each drink. I know I'm addicted to the alertness caffeine provides, as I'm sure most of us are, but there is no excuse not to be safe about how much we take in each day.

Been using this brand of Yerba Mate for years. I like it even better since I’ve been gifted a 8.3” Bombilla straw with a heatproof silicone tip which is great, no French press and no straining!

My husband loves this brand in drinks but honestly they add up buying the cans everyday , he is not a coffee drinker but needs the energy for his 10-12hr shift’s , and buying the pack of cans did not seem cost officiant either. I used to brew him other brands of Yerba Mate teas when we lived in San Francisco but could not find any strong ones in our area of Sam diego now . After looking around I came across this loose leaf tea one and honestly it’s been great , the taste is strong and not flavorful  as the Can ones but it also does not say it is lol , what I do is buy sweet flavor loose teas at my local farmers market that don’t have caffeine so I don’t add more and give the man a heart attack , also can use tea puches and ass a bit of honey or sugar to each it’s own for some sweetness . Works great and he has more flavor options than the canned ones , also Have the option to make it as strong or light  as he wants with many different flavor options , make a big pitcher that last all week and is ready to make it iced in a hydro flask . Overall GREAT purchase , money saver .

I used to drink coffee at 3:00 each day but this is my new go to pick me up. A cup of yerba mate tea is delicious and soothing. It is delicious just as it is and doesn’t need sweetener.

I am hooked on this smooth as silk tea.  Have been drinking it for years after tasting it at a Yoga health a wellness center.  It is so delicious and has many variations to indulge in.  Cold, hot, your choice.  What are you waiting for?

Great brand. Always. Never a complaint.

I love this tea, my favorite tea! I received exactly what I order and pretty quick.

We did not have any idea how this would taste. It is very good.

This stuff is hard to explain.It seems most similar to green tea, but it has an earthier taste, nuttier maybe. I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green "tea" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste.

Over the years I’ve been developing more of a taste for teas.  One day I came across an article talking about the benefits of this particular tea.+ Loaded with all kinds of vitamins, mineral, and antioxidants+ Boost your immune system+ Help increase energy and mental focus (mainly due to the caffeine)I’ve only had this warm.  I prepare it by heating up water then throwing 1-2 packets into my giant mug, then slowly stir it for about 2-3 minutes.  My first few sips of it weren’t bad, but not great.  Overtime though I did like the grassy/earthy taste it has.  Noticeably different than any other varieties of tea I’ve ever had!  If you’re not into such a strong taste, try diluting it a bit!Whenever I drink Yerba Mate Tea I definitely notice a decent boost of mental clarity, but different than if I were to just drink a ton of coffee and get a huge rush from the caffeine.  Furthermore since there is much less caffeine in Yerba Mate Tea (40mg) compared to coffee (100-120mg) I don’t ever experience a crash from the caffeine and I feel alright drinking this at night and not have to worry about staying up all night.For 75 bags the price isn’t too shabby, but if you’re strictly after caffeine content I probably look to a combination of coffee and green / black tea for the best bang for your buck.  As for those seek a little more variety in their caffeine, this is a wonderful selection!

Stuff will give you a buzz!

For several years I have enjoyed drinking Yerba Mate tea. When my coffee consumption started to get out of hand, I was looking for an alternative that didn't leave me crashing in the afternoon. A friend suggested I try Yerba tea because it has been around for hundreds of years, is a natural source of caffeine, has digestive benefits, all without the afternoon crash.  At the time, I could only find Yerba tea in health food stores. Each time I ran out of a box (usually around 20 tea bags), I would have to trek to the store for more. I'm not a fan of the Yerba teas with added stevia, vanilla, or the "smoked" flavor. When I found this Guayaki brand on amazon, I thought 75 tea bags for $11 would certainly sacrifice flavor for cost. But I was wrong! I love the tea - and it has successfully kept me from returning to my coffee over-addiction :)  The tea steeps for about 5 minutes. I put the tea bag into my mug and use my Keurig machine for instant hot water. I like to add some honey, and occasionally some milk or cream. By itself, it can be a little strong on an empty stomach, but green tea is also too strong for me on an empty stomach. I never have that coffee crash, and my mind actually feels clearer than with coffee.I would highly recommend this Guayaki Yerba Mate tea - for the taste & for the money! It's a great deal!!

I like it the tea because you coming in time

For $11.25 or 15 cents per packet at time of purchase for a total of 75 bags of tea this is a great deal.When I look for tea I generally look for three things: price, taste, and health benefits. Guayaki Yerba Mate tea is very cheaply priced online as described earlier and all you have to do is walk the aisles at your grocery store to see that. In terms of taste, it is actually derived from a plant of the same name in South America and is actually a species of Holly. It is somewhat like an earthier green tea with a slight (pleasant) bite depending on how you brew it.Health wise, I drink it every morning and it helps wake me up without the rise and fall that regular coffee provides, and like most fresh brewed hot tea I find it personally mellows me out and helps me get ready to face the challenges of the day. Additionally, it has helped regulate my digestion and overall just made me feel slightly better overall. When I got a head cold a steaming cup of Yerba Mate helped clear up my sinuses although I've found most hot teas will do the same, though I will qualify these statement with the fact that I am not a doctor and haven't done any studies, these are just my personal observations.I definitely plan on rebuying this tea when my current supply runs out.

He specifically asked for this tea. Less expensive than on their web site.

I recently tried Guayaki Yerba Mate and LOVE it so very much.Having recently undergone major GI surgery I am no longer allowed processed sugars of any type which also effect what I can and cannot eat.Guayaki Yerba Mate has taken care of my cravings for chocolate thanks to the tea containing the same compounds found in chocolate without the added sugars, fats and other ingredients found in processed chocolates. Also it does not cause any GI upset to my stomach thanks to a very love tannin level.I make mine hot in the morning for as my eye opener.I also Sun brew for sipping throughout the day. My husband chuckles when he opens the refrigerator and see my stash of the 4 1/2 gallon  mason jars filled to the brim with sun brewed Yerba Mate.. I sip on cold Year Mate throughout the day. I am one of the few that caffeine does not cause sleeplessness in, thankfully.The flavor of Yerba Mate is very refreshing and similar to a green tea yet does not give the flavor of the grassy flavor much like a sencha green tea.If you are watching the calories and crave the chocolate euphoria this will fulfill that craving without the calories as well as give you a nice pick me up.

Yerba Mate picks me up but does not result in "tea hangover."

I’ve been trying to find a similar option to what I used in Southern Brazil. This product is exactly what I wanted and brings back some great memories from that time in South America.

every morning with a bit of honey starts my day off right

This tea is very yummy and easy to make with tons of flavor

Other reviewers have mention the fine particles in Guayaki Loose Yerba Mate, but all the Yerba Mate I've tried had some fine particles, and this does not bother me. Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and "on edge" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in
Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag
, so if the fine particles bother you, the bags may be a better choice.

I've been using this Guayaki Traditional Organic Yerba Mate' either in bags (however, pretty sure, not organic in that form) or in loose leaf pretty regularly over the past about thirty years. Lately, we have been using this loose leaf mate exclusively as our first tea of the morning, and, prior to any coffee. I really like the flavor -- rich and full. If there's more left, as usually the case in the glass pot I use, I pour over more hot water, use this way -- and/or use the leftovers to make a great iced tea, sweetened or unsweetened. I find that mate' is far gentler on my stomach and likewise, on the nervous system, than our good ol' coffee we love. Have reduced my coffee from two to one rich cup later in morning. By the way, I've tried other brands of mate' over the years -- anyway, a few -- and keep coming back to this. Don't need to try others anymore -- no point.

This tea is great for waking up your brain and centering on focus for me,  some days in the late afternoon, this is what is needed.  I don't drink it everyday and it doesn't make you crash like coffee.  It's a subtle refresh. The taste is woodsy, I don't love that but I can tolerate it for the effect I get.

If you haven't tried Yerba Mate and you are a coffee drinker you are really doing yourself a disservice. I started drinking it to replace coffee about 6 months ago and this stuff is beyond what I expected. I've even managed to lose about 10 lbs because of it! It keeps me awake and active through the day without the uncomfortable jitters and sugar crashes that came as a result of over consumption of coffee. I've tried two different brands now and guayakí is my favorite so far. If you have never tried it I suggest trying it in a can before you dive in and buy the loose leaf. The loose leaf is by far the better value (even better than the tea bags) but has a little more of an earthy flavor. I've never been a huge fan of tea but I can't get enough of this stuff. It is seriously the best. If you are skeptical please take this review as your extra push to give it a try you won't regret it!!

The best Yerba Mate around!

Good ratio between sticks and the dust. Not overly bitter. More cost effective, 1/2-3/4 cup of this gourd is enough to keep my alert for the full day. Definitely a must for those looking for a coffee alternative.There was a slight tear in the bag so dust came out

Absolutely love this tea! I have been an avid coffee drinker for over a decade, and as I have gotten older it has started to give me some stomach issues due to it's acidity. I was looking for a switch because I still love having a cup of something warm in the morning. This was the perfect substitute as it also gave me a bit of a caffeine kick.To brew I use my coffee maker like normal but don't put any coffee beans in. I put a travel mug underneath with two bags and set the alarm for the AM. I let it steep for 10 minutes or so then add a bit of agave and lemon. Easy on the stomach, tastes great, gives me a caffeine kick and I know I am getting a bunch of antioxidants in the morning. Already on my second bag!

I am newly OBSESSED with this tea. I stopped drinking coffee because it made me feel anxious. I replaced it with this. It’s so comforting and I enjoy the heck out of it every morning. It literally makes my morning! I drink it plain and I don’t get jitters or anxious feeling. It’s my happy drink

I have never heard of this tea before.  My doctor found out that I was a caffeine junkie and advised me that I needed to kick the habit.  OMG!  How could I ever do such a thing.  So I let my fingers do the walking and found this product.  Ok....what would I have to lose.  A few dollars and cents.  So, I ordered Yerba Mate.  I opened the bag, smelled it and yuck....smelled like dirt.  I as expecting the worst.  My first cup was surprising yummy.  I have been drinking it now for several months.  I kicked the caffeine without killing anyone.  My morning cup-o-joe is no mo. (more)  I agree with the reviewers that this tea may be an acquired taste.  It is different but I have enjoyed it very much.  It also tends to curve my appetite which is always a good thing.  Give it a try.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I love this tea!!! I take it to work and enjoy it at home. It has just enough caffeine, helps curb your appetite naturally, and taste great. I love the tea bag version so I can take it with me any where I go. It has become harder to find lately. I was able to find it at Whole Foods but it's hit or miss lately. I have tried other Yerba mate brands and I always come back to this one. Just Love It! ❤

I developed a caffeine intolerance but Yerba mate doesn't bother me the way coffee or sodas do. From what I've read the chemical make up is different in Yerba Mate (YM) compared to caffeine in other drinks.What I absolutely love about YM is that it gives a slight energy boost & even a happiness without the jittery feeling & you won't have a crash after an hour or so as with regular caffeinated drinks. Don't misunderstand though, it doesn't bring you up if you are sad. I've tried triple doses to test this but on a regular day it adds a bit of a skip to your step. :)The flavor isn't much to be desired but add a little local honey (which is extremely good for fighting allergies) & it will grow on ya.I do not ever want to be without my YM. Just wish I could find it locally since I use a 75 count bag in about a month.

I love mate, and this is very tasty! I love this brand's smoky, earthy, herbal flavor that is never bitter whether it's hot or cold.  Usually when I wake up I drink it hot with no sugar, and it gives me a nice boost in the day without giving me a jittery feeling.  When it's hot, I make a pitcher of this iced, with sugar, a spoonful of rosewater, and a squeeze of lime. Yeah, it's not traditional at all, but it is so good! :)This package contains 75 teabags.  The bags don't have strings and are not individually packaged, which I like because it cuts down on waste.  If you know what mate tastes like and drink it regularly, this is an economical purchase.  If you haven't tried mate before, I'd suggest getting a smaller sized pack at first because it doesn't taste like tea.

Been a really helpful replacement for coffee

I purchased this tea several months ago. I use it occasionally in place of coffee. It may be an acquired taste, as it taste like liquid grass from your yard to me. However I steep two bags in a cup of hot water for several minutes. Squeeze out the water and add a little bit of milk. The Taste is not terribly objectionable it's just different. However the desired effect for me is to have a caffeine boost or a little bit of stimulant boost. This will do that because it has caffeine in it, however the way it works is not the sudden onset of the jitters like a strong cup of coffee can do. This is more gradual and without really a crash when it wears off. So I highly recommend that you try it and see how it works for you.

I love, love, LOVE Guaki Yerba Mate. This gives me the little kick I need to get going in the morning! Because I'm not a fan of the taste plain, I usually put some Stevia in a hot brew or ice it with some lemonade or other flavors. Tastes just like the what you would buy in the store. I don't use the traditional gourd, but have reausable cheese-cloth tea bags that I brew them in for about 15 minutes. Depending on how strong you want it, I add about 1 TBSP. Great price for a LOT of tea! It is REALLY fined grained, some parts are powdery, so I would recommend cheese cloth straining to get the bits out. I ordered this a month ago drinking almost every day and still have barely made a dent. Absolutely recommend.

Like alot of people have shared this tea is so weak in taste. I'm sad I paid $8 for this. I'm trying two bags together now to see if I can even use this. Using one bag, is like trying to squeeze a second round out of a tea bag. It's that weak and not worth spending any more money on. I won't even try any other of this company's tea's because of this.

The ingredients are not listed on this item online. It is horrible and not chai. It is made with a hemp bag that gives it a flavor and in the tea bag the ingredients are licorice root, ginger root, fennel and cinnamon bark, and cardamom pod & vanilla. Licorice and fennel are not in chai.

How do I get my money back for such a terrible product when they are not eligible for return?Every bag splits!!!

Should have labelled as Cinnamon Tea rather than Vanilla Tea.  It does taste vanilla at all. I am totally disappointed.

Weak and nasty taste, not my cup of tea at all

No taste

This product tasted vile. It does not contain any tea leaves so is just a herbal blend. I tried adding milk and it was awful. I do not recommend this product at all.

I love Pukka tea, but this Vanilla Chai is tasteless.  Maybe a bad batch.  Had high hopes & wasn’t past the expiration date.

I’m not a fan of licorice flavor in my chai as it overpowers everything else. This tea has a really strong licorice flavor and wasn’t spicy at all.

This actually isn't chai at all.  Chai is a type of spiced Indian tea.  This is a spice infusion that has only spices and no tea at all of any kind.  I infused it in warm milk and used in in a cup of actual tea and it was pleasant.  It might be useful to infuse cider or wine but I have not tried this.  But as a drink by itself I found it watery and insipid.

I was looking for lovely chai tea but this was too mild and not strong enough. I bought a box of Twinings' Chai tea and they were lovely!

To me it tastes too much of cinnamon, in fact it overpowers other ingredients. I can't bring myself to drink it.

Brought for my husband, but he did not like it. Says he prefers the ordinary Chai.

don't like a taste of it

This is just what I was hoping it would be. It is a very tasty decaf chai tea. Perfect for a non-stimulating evening cuppa.

Really like the flavors and easy to order from Amazon

This is so so good!!!

This is a fabulous tea, but Amazon fulfillment should know to send this in a box and not a padded envelope. This was meant to be part of a gift, but I can’t give it to someone now that it is smashed and open. Please ship this tea in a hard-sided box. Thanks!

This is  a great tea with a pleasing taste

I love pukka tea. I was glad it arrived quickly and I am enjoying every sip.

It tastes to strong of licorice

I sleep well at night

Excellent and delivered on time

Pukka is one of the best organic teas on the market.  I''m a huge Chai fan, however this Chai was a little too mellow for me.

Delicious, though it took well over a month to receive.

Pricey, but very nice.

I am bit confused. It says that it is a vanilla tea, but there is no tea in it. Also it smells like cinnamon, taste like it and have 40% of it, only 4% of vanilla. But still I like it. It's spicy and warms me up.

I love the chai tea, so maybe Im picky... first of all, is a taste that not many people will like, is a bit spicy and very different to all other teas...  I didnt give the 5 stars because I like a more intense flavor, Im not from india anyway, so not an expert, but is very good anyway.

I use this tea to make chai bubble tea and the flavour is amazing. Not sure it’s worth the price for how few teabags you get, so wouldn’t recommend for regular drinkers.

tasty, especially if you brew a cup and then leave the rest to seep overnight you have a lovely vanilla drink the following day.

You can smell the mouth watering warm scent of cinnamon and vanilla waft through your house when you make this tea, it is delicious and delicious and even more delicious. Totally recommend it.

I would buy this again. It is quite refresing. Only down side is it smells kind of funky before it's made into a cuppa.

This tea is like a dessert on its own! The spices give a beautiful smell when you open the box.

Amazing tea and great delivery time. No complaints here. Great Overall I think the Pukka Tea is one of my favorite herbal teas around. It’s tasty, satisfying and warming. Usually I find herbal teas can smell a lot better than they taste, but I have to say this one follows through. I would happily drink it any time or day, and it might even start to push my old favorite Early Grey out on occasion.Vanilla chai is excellent for warm pick me ups in place of earl grey

That says it all.

this tea is soo good! im addicted, gonna buy more. it really doesn't even need honey or anything to sweeten it unless you are they type to add some sweet to your tea then it will definietly taste good as well!

I really like the flavor of this tea.  It’s decaffeinated and wonderful in the evening to relax before bed.

Pukka Tea's never disappoint. Love the flavor, love the box, love how it makes me feel.

A lovey beverage addition to our office "coffee bar". It smells and tastes wonderful

A friend loved the gift I sent her. It was smashed when it came tho it was fine long as the inside stayed good

Wife had this tea in England and loved it.

This tea is amazing, even if it did ship all the way from England

Love the tea unique awesome flavor

Great product. My favorite Chai.

YUMMY

Great taste without the caffeine.

SO DELICIOUS. Not overpowering, just a simple, sweet drink.

fast and yummy as always

Great tea!

I don't usually like chai, but this was really good! Highly recommend.

When my husband was in Scotland this summer I had him pick me up a few boxes of Pukka teas to try. I am not really a chai fan so was pleasantly surprised that out of the 8 or so flavors I tried, THIS was my favorite! It does not have the usual "bite" of a chai tea and that is what I like about it. Still spicy, but nice and smooth. I'm here to purchase more!

Discovered in Paris, missing in Italy. Delicious!

If you like tea this is a good Chai tea to getI would definitely buy from them againThe seller was really good, no shipping problemsIf you like buying tea this is a good company to buy fromI'll buy from them again

Love this so much. I love that it's organic. Have tried Numerous Pukka Teas I'm never let down. I put a cinnamon stick in with the tea for an extra cinnamon kick. Love, love , love! 🙌🏻

Delicious and doesn’t bother my stomach!

Amazing aftertaste....the tea has very little flavour of vanilla but strong cinnamon, fennel and mulethi flavour. I loved this tea and have ordered it again. Perfect as a dessert after meals, this tea leaves you refreshed and happy. Tastes best when steeped for 5-8 min.

Great tea.

Really refreshing Tea flavour..price a little on the higher side but still makes you feel royal and perfect for the me time drink...Although mentions Vanilla- it has strong cinnamon accent which adds depth to thebrew.I am ready to buy in bulk- but very expensive.

Exactly what I expected and quock delivery

Love it

The spice mix in this particular chai is smooth and relaxing

Thank you for the product.

My neighbour loves this Pukka Herbs chai tea so I purchased it for when she pops in for a cuppa

Overpriced here on Amazon (usually around £2.50 in shops) but flavour wise one of my favourite herbal teas. I let the bag sit for at least 10mins before adding in some stevia and some Meadow Churn 10% coffee cream. Reminds me of eggnog without the calories or sugar. Not as tasty au natural but that's just my taste buds perhaps.

Delicious!

Lovely, warming Chai tea. The vanilla adds a gentle sweetness. Vanilla is great for supressing the appetite, so I always have a cup if I am feeling peckish between meals. Defintiely will buy again.

Great for a evening of relaxation

Absolutely love this tea. I'm usually a coffee drinker but now I'm hooked on this. It smells lovely and the cinnamon warmth is perfect for a cold day.

Spent a solid amount of money buying my favourite chocolate and its all so stale!! Look at the color! This chocolate is usually a dark dark brown and melts in your mouth. This stuff is grey and just crumbles and tastes old and gross. I ordered a 6 pack and every single one is like this. I wanted to return it but they have a no refund policy so its just going in the trash. Not edible. I want my money back!!!!

I bought a couple bars of Theo 85% dark chocolate at the store to see if I liked it.  I did, so I ordered this package of 12.  I opened the first bar and it was the color of milk chocolate and had a weird texture.  God only knows what you have to do to nice, dark chocolate to make it look, taste and feel like something else, but someone in the chain from Theo to me pulled it off.  Best of all, the product can't be returned.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I love Theo's chocolate but no where nearby carries it. I thought get a bunch from Amazon, but the chocolate I received were bad. There's no return or replacement policy for this so unless you want to risk getting bad chocolate and not being able to get new ones, don't buy from Amazon.

Theo makes some of the best chocolate in the world. But this was delivered in defective condition.  The chocolate is oxidized and dried the expiration date has not passed, so it must have been stored improperly .  Worse, evidently it cannot be returned or replaced by Amazon. Terrible experience and waste of money.

The chocolate has bloomed making this product inedible. The texture and taste are undesirable. I’ve ordered this product several times and this is the first time having an issue. Unfortunately Amazon or the vendor will not replace the product.

Clearly this chocolate was over the hill.  It had bloomed, was stale and dry, and lacked flavor.  I spent $50 on chocolate that’s inedible. This is normally my favorite dark chocolate, so I was extremely disappointed. Will never order again.

I have never seen this before. The last two orders were like this and I ordered this one before I opened the previous order. So I have 2 boxes that are bad and can’t return them! Don’t buy from Pantry Provisions!

Even though it's only 70 degrees out, all of the chocolate bars had melted.  The chocolate bloomed and the components separated, totally ruining the bar

It does not have the normal creamy texture or  taste and it looks unappealing. I can only imagine it was not stored properly.

The chocolate bars arrived a meted mess.They would have been delicious however you cannot ship chocolate from Indiana to Arizona midsummer without proper temperature controlled packaging.

Do not purchase from this supplier. This is a good product but from this supplier they did not ship properly.

Not freshIt’s actually the worst dark chocolate bar I’ve ever tasted. So bad upi threw it out

The product is old and disintegrating. Not edible.

I wish I had known before buying and consuming this. This chocolate has one of the highest amounts of lead and cadmium! This information should really be listed on the label. I’m so disappointed in this brand.

The bars were shipped with some sort of cool pack but when opened I noticed the bars were a bit misshaped. When I tried opening the bar it was melted into the wrapper. When I went to eat hoping it at least tasted good I noticed the taste was off. My hubby said he may be able to use it for baking but after he took a bite he said no the chocolates no good. I enjoy this chocolate I’ve bought it from the grocery store but I do not recommend purchasing online.

Zero stars. Negative 100 if I could. They’re not even trying!I researched the best organic dark chocolate and thought this was a good investment for gifts and treating myself, purchasing a case.What an incredible disappointment. A total waste of 50 bucks!Like wax! Tastes awful with a strange flavor that’s unidentifiable. The texture is like hard styrofoam or Tiny plastic pellets when you bite it. Like biting into a candle with small pellets or slivers of wax falling to the bottom of your mouth that make you want to spit it out. Don’t buy this garbage!

Sadly past the return date for this or I would have sent it back after a friend sent me the consumer reports article that breaks down cadmium and lead in bars from different companies. Since lead and cadmium are both cumulative toxins, I don't need any extra in my chocolate.

I have bought Theo before.  This time the chocolate  came with the light brown color patina...it had "bloomed". There was no return option so I am stuck with all these bars.  It was probably exposed to heat at some point before getting to me.  I will not buy again unless the folks at Theo read this and replace.

I just read in the news that Theo chocolate is high in heavy metals including lead!!! so disappointing! and amazon won't let me return it.  YUCK!!!  do not buy!

Don't buy this product-it came melted together and Amazon does not allow a return.  $43 for 12 chocolate bars, I expected better. Extremely disappointed, as I waited a month to receive them, and they are not edible.

This chocolate tastes like mold. I had the unfortunate experience of biting into some moldy bread once and the flavor has stuck with me ever since. This chocolate tastes like mold. What a waste of $45. It is ineatiable.

Love Theo chocolate but this purchase on Amazon from thenewmall is tasteless. Maybe it got too hot in shipping? I don’t know how to address the poor quality.

I was here when this arrived. It did not have any cold packing with it, as promised. Chocolate is inedible as it must have been in the heat for days on the truck. I deserve a refund!

Tagged as 85% but sent a whole box of 70%. Was specifically shopping for 85%. Not as described, do not recommend.

I love Theos chocolate! Unfortunately, the bars arrived tainted in some way and don’t look safe to eat. There’s no option for me to return the product.

Chocolates very dry and inedible. Unacceptable for such a pricey item

Not real Theo chocolate/ damaged

They are nasty and taste nothing like the ones I usually get with the almonds and sea salt.

Until the companies who produce dark chocolate can figure out this mess, avoid these products, they are toxic. Check out the recent consumer and safety reports regarding this.

I remember trying Theo years ago and thinking it tasted like mold. I think it was the bar with cherries or nuts. I didn’t want to have it again for years. Just tried it again, the 85% bar and it tastes like mold. I have never had any other chocolate taste like mold. It is absolutely bizarre. Get it together, Theo.

Awful tasting chocolate - overly bitter, bad after taste.

All the bars were melted and some to the extent that half the bar was missing!  The whole lot went straight into the bin.I called Amazon and, to their credit, they refunded the entire amount.  They have always been stand-up in this regard.

Theo is an excellent brand when fresh. However, when it is improperly stored, it turns a lighter brown. The best by date on my package was 7/2025.

UPDATE:  vendor provided me with a full refund upon reviewing the pictures. I’ve had this same brand of chocolate before and it has always been delicious. This is the first time I see it like this. Not sure, but it seems it was either damage getting transported or in a warehouse.

The shipping box arrived intact. But when I opened it, the box of sho plate bars was ripped open.

Loves me some dark 85%-90% chocolate. I usually buy Lindt Excellence 85% and 90% and on occasion the Green & Black's 85% and am always very pleased with them. My mom bought the Theo 85% bar knowing I like really dark chocolate so I was excited to try it. Maybe we got a bad bar. It was somewhat dry and grainy with no 'snap' like the Lindt bars, nor did it have any discernible flavour notes that I love so much with the Lindt and Green & Black's bars; in fact it was very 'flat' tasting. It did not readily melt on the tongue like the other bars either. Neither of us enjoyed it. All in all, not a very pleasurable experience.

For $50 I expected good chocolate. Unfortunately the entire box of 12 bars was not properly stored and had gone bad. With no return option, I am feeling pretty let down by Amazon right about now.-update: Amazon did end up refunding me for the full purchase price, but I had to contact their customer service to make that happen. Thanks for taking care of me Amazon, it does not go unappreciated.

First order was wonderful -- the chocolate bars arrived intact and yummy.  This was another order, and the bars arrived melted/rehardened, have a powdery film on them, some broken and stuck to the inner wrapper.  Very disappointed in this most recent order, and can't share the chocolate with friends due to poor appearance and altered flavor.

The first order came in an insulated bag. This one was not and badly melted. Don’t order in the summer. Even putting in freezer is was a mess, stuck to wrapper.

Good value, rich flavor, fresh.  I strongly recommend this product.

THIS NOT AS TASTY AS I EXPECTED...

Love this bar.  But am concerned that cadmium was discovered in this bar http://www.asyousow.org/our-work/environmental-health/toxic-enforcement/lead-and-cadmium-in-food/

Good flavor .

Normally I wouldn't buy this dark of chocolate, but I have changed to a low carb lifestyle.  Typically, 70% dark chocolate is as dark as I enjoy eating.  I still love baked goods so I am experimenting with recipes that are gluten free/low carb and that is where this extra dark chocolate comes in.  I love the fact that it is organic, fair trade, and non-gmo......excellent qualities to start with!  It is smooth and creamy.  I can't give it 5 stars (which is = 'I love it') because it is still too dark for me to want to nibble on it, but I have found it to be great in recipes, especially when I sweeten it up with erythritol.  If you are a person who enjoys this dark of chocolate, you will absolutely enjoy this!

This product  is  fine,  what I ordered and expected.  Nothing  sensational,  I would order again.  The important thing to me is  organic.  I avoid putting poisons into my body

This is my 3rd brand of dark chocolate 85% Ive tried. I like it the most simply for the way it tastes over the other two.

Very healthy and has a great taste and is perfect used in my oatmeal.

Good chocolate that respects fair trade, and does not use child labor. Great with my morning coffee. :)

Great flavor.

Great tasting dark chocolate..

Good chocolate and good ingredient list at a reasonable price

great quality and fair price

Got this for my mom who loves dark chocolate. It was my gift to her for Mother’s Day. Great Gift! What makes it even better is my name is Theo, so it worked as a perfect, fun gift.

Good quality chocolates

We are really enjoying this chocolate! I love that it’s 85% cocoa, and tastes delicious and natural!

I’ve tasted several different dark chocolates and really didn’t care for the bitterness.  Like any other product, you get what you pay for. What a difference!

After seeing this chocolate mentioned it several vegetarian and environmental newsletters, I thought I would give it a try for part of my husband's Valentine's day gift. He is so impressed! Says it is without question the best chocolate he has ever tasted! Very smooth without the chalky and dry taste often found in other dark chocolate. Will definitely purchase again!

I USE FOR HEATHY REASON

These arrived well insulated and nothing was broken. It was perfect. We had planned on giving these out and the quality was, as always, fantastic. We love Theo's dark chocolates because the darkness, while strong, never really tastes bitter or sweet. The chocolate is smooth and full of great flavor. Just a little bit will be enough to satisfy you and a bar could last you a good while. It is a favorite in our house and I am so glad to find that amazon sells these bars. I was also very happy to see there wan'st a crazy mark up these, if anything i think i even found that the case was slightly cheaper than had I bought from the theo's website. SCORE

They strive to make "the finest artisan chocolate in the world".  They are also "the first organic and Fair Trade chocolate factory" in the U.S.  It is simply an excellent chocolate tasting experience!But where do their cacao beans come from?  According to their website, "currently, our beans come primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Peru."As long as China is not listed, it sounds good to me.  Thanks, Theo, for an excellent chocolate treat!  And did I mention? -- its flavor and consistency (and no soy!) beat Newman's Own organics hands down!  (Sorry, Pa and Nell!)

This dark chocolate was surprisingly good tasting. It’s not too bitter. It appears to be good quality chocolate. I recommend it.

We love your chocolate - and since supply chains have affected the local supplies on Kauai, we ordered through Amazon.  Arrived IN TWO DAYS - to Kauai - well packed, and insulated with a few small ice bricks inside.  Altho the ice bricks had melted by the time it arrived here, they kept the chocolate completely intact.  Great company.  Good price.  Good Service

It has been really hot here yet my chocolate was not even the slightest melted.  The chocolate was on an insulated bag with an ice pack.  I was really impressed with how well packaged it was.  The chocolate is absolutely delicious and has a low sugar content.  HIGHLY recommended.

Flavor, value for the money

Gotta support our local brand - go Seattle! We dont to to grocery that often anymore in this crazy time, so have to shop here as much as I can. Glad to see Theo is here. Flavor is great, love how sophisticated the 85% tastes. Small bar on the pricy side though.

One of the best dark chocolates, I ever had! My sons and I love theo dark 85%. We are so used to theo we can hardly eat any other chocolate. I also love the theo 72% orange dark and the coconut/dark flavors! A must try for dark chocolate lovers!

I had previously purchased the 70% Theo bars, but those were too addictive - too much like candy. The 85% bars are much less likely to result in out-of-control binge eating.

Good quality chocolate without 'extra' ingredients like soy lecithin, which can be problematic for some people.  Highly recommend these bars!

I've been looking for 85% dark chocolate for a long time. I had to use a lot of different brands, some from Germany, and other places in Europe before I discovered Theo. I love this chocolate - this is the pure truth!

Simple ingredients, indulgent taste, silky mouth feel at room temp.INGREDIENTSCocoa Beans*+, Cane Sugar*+, Cocoa Butter*+, Ground Vanilla Bean*.*ORGANIC +FAIR TRADEThat is it!

While I find Theo to be a little more costly than other chocolates - too me, Theo chocolate has  a richer chocolate taste.

I order this choc because I use it in my steel cut oatmeal....it's very rich and has a dark chic bitter flavor, that comes with this type of choc. I wanted as healthy a choc as I could get. The other major thing that appealed to me was that it is made in Seattle, which is close to my home state Cali, so I wanted to support a US made product 😊

A bar of Theo lasts me several or more days. It's my go-to chocolate that's not loaded with sugar.  I like it! But not in the way that I would consume a whole bar at one time. I buy it by the box. I've checked around other brands, but come back to Theo.

Wonderful dark chocolate, not too sweet, but a great taste!

Good

Ok

Only 3 natural ingredients!

I am a dark chocolate lover and just could not resist ordering the 85% to give it a try.  Yum, love it!  What a treat.

Theo Chocolate bars (all flavors) are my go-to in the grocery store - and now online. A fam fave. Best of all, they are free from soy lecithin and other industrial-food-complex additives.

I bought it to replace Green & Black chocolate that I can't find at a reasonable price since the pandemic. I like it.

This is far and away the best chocolate I have ever had.  I cannot be without it.  I am now ordering a dozen bars at a time.

My wife really like this brand of chocolate.  Also like the fact it is from a fair trade company that helps the grower.

I'm about to place my third order for a 12 pack.  Fair price and best tasting chocolate I've had in a long time.

Have added Theo to the regular Endangered Species and Green&Black chocolate here. Theo's is a nice addition and organic, too.

These are my favorite chocolates/sweet snacks. I follow intermittent fasting and try to eat as Keto as possible. These chocolates really fix my sweet tooth cravings.

Great flavor and careful packaging!  Bought during summer and came with gel pack to keep from melting.

Perfectly balanced dark chocolate.Has lower sugar than many other brands, without artificial sweeteners. To me, that’s the most important factor.

A fair trade organic product at a fair price.

If you like dark chocolate and red wine, this would be a perfect flavor.

This product is a deep rich chocolate that is intense. Excellent flavor!

I love the product, but not sure I can slurge to pay this much again!

Consistent quality.  The perfect answer to healthy sweet treats with the bitter dark chocolate and smooth deep chocolate flavor. Theo hits all the right marks for me as company and product.

Excellent flavorVery satisfying!!!!!!!!!

This dark chocolate is yummy!  I like to think that it is good for me.

Have had this product before, likes it then, liked it now.

Peppermint and licorice at first glance don’t seem to pair well, but that’s wrong. It is an excellent pairing and now one of my favorite teas.

Love this tea.

I really like Pukka teas.  The are delicious.

Such a nice sweet flavor that helps with sugar cravings

I love this tea. It's got a naturally slightly sweet taste from the licorice and the mint is so complimentary. However, I can't seem to find it for a normal price. Maybe it's discontinued? If the price doesn't go down from $12, I will have to find an alternative.

This is a delicious licorice flavored tea. Very subtle. If you have ever been to an Aveda salon and had their tea, this is as close to it as you’re going to come. For about 1/4 of the price. Delivery is fairly quick and comes in a very cute package. I have re-ordered this several times. With winter coming, it’s one of those comfortable things to have a cup of tea and curl up with a good book in the afternoon.

This is a perfect night time tea for me.  It's flavor is rich and delish and there's no caffeine to keep me awake.

We really like this tea.  I also put a teaspoon of honey in before poring boiling water in and then putting the tea bag in.  It tastes sooo good!  Highly recommended!

I am a picky, avid tea drinker. I don't like bland, and I can't stand teas that are "natural" with intense flavor that  comes from I-don't-want-to-know-where. I just want herbs. In tea. This tea is sweet, the aftertaste is so delicious. I know that when I drink this, it adds to my health in a real way. More than I can say for a lot of tea brands out there. I paid 9 bucks for this, I think it's worth it for sure (and I'm a cheapskate). To be honest, I don't want you to know how good it is..because I'd like to have an Amazon warehouse-ful of tea.. just for me.I haven't tried any of the other offerings by Pukka, but I intend to very soon.

Pretty disappointed in this actually. Heard some buzz and decided to try it... The packaging is pretty! But it completely oversells what's inside. Frankly the tea was pretty bland and flavorless. Unlikely to buy again.

Really wanted to like it, but it was far too sweet for me.  I'm a big fan of both peppermint and licorice, but apparently the licorice root just has too much natural sweetness for my taste.

To me this takes nothing like peppermint. And nothing like Licorice.

left a really bad aftertaste in my mouth

The first time I had a cup of peppermint & licorice tea was from my meditation class and it was delish.  So, of course, I immediately wanted to get some.  I went to Publix, Walmart, so I didn't have to wait for a shipment, but I was only able to get it from Amazon, and was happy to get it.  I do enjoy it, but it just isn't quite the same as the first cup.  I'm wondering if they also carry another peppermint & licorice tea that may be the actual tea I had the first time.  I shared this with my friend, and she loves it!

If you like licorice, you will enjoy this tea.However the herbals are very faint. To taste the peppermint and licorice, I use at least two teabags at a time. Someone else might prefer more. For a 20 count box, be aware that the tea will get used up faster.

I couldn’t taste the licorice in this tea even when I put two teabags in my cup.

I don’t like the peppermint and licorice combination. The cinnamon and licorice flavor is much better.

Flavor, was not special. Would not buy again.

I like this tea.  The flavor is refreshing, strong and fresh tasting.  However, for me there is probably too much licorice, or maybe it just naturally over-powers the mint.If you like a little mint with Licorice then you will probably like this tea.

Wayyyy less strong/sweet than tea pigs. Still good just not as strong. So if you like tea pigs, stick w that, if tea pigs is too strong, then this is the one for you

These were very interesting. The tea turned out a bit weak so I ended up using two tea bags per cup but whatever. Definitely worth a try.I definitely didn’t dislike them, the flavor was just not for me. Makes me want to try other unusual kinds of tea.

I decided to give this tea a try after reading about it on a blog I follow. The product arrived within a week or so even though it had to travel across the pond, Great Britain to the States. The taste is delightful, but it could be slightly stronger for my taste.

A good tea.

This was similar to a sweet mint tea. The taste was okay. I would have liked a more pronounced licorice flavor.

It was pretty good but not great.  Like of an odd blend of flavors for me.

Enjoyable new tea flavor.

Love this tea

I don't use milk or sweetener, the licorice provides enough sweetness.

Good

This is the most delicious drink. It also provides a rather comforting  and healthy alternative to coffee. Try it you will not be disappointed

ok

I love the Peppermint & Licorice flavor. I don’t need any sugar or additives to make it taste Sso yummy!

Like many others, I got the idea for this tea from a book series that I was reading (I think I"m currently on book 12). The protagonist drank this all the time. So I bought it from the UK and I love it. Here's what happens when you drink this tea. It goes in your mouth kind of watery with a bit of (I'm having some now so I had to stop for a sip to get this right) peppermint flavor, and then about 2 seconds after you swallow it, the back of your throat literally is coated with a deep, rich delicious licorice flavor. It's kind of addicting, waiting for that wonderful licorice to just fill my taste buds with its richness. You won't be sorry if you try this. Soooo good.

I drink this as a form of "dessert" because the licorice provides a subtle sweetness, the peppermint is right underneath the sweetness.  I don't really get a strong licorice flavor, just a hint in the finish.It's really good, you should try it.Highly Recommended!

This is great after dinner organic tea. The licorice really relieves the stress and the peppermint pairs beautifully with the licorice.

The flavor is amazing and will cure any upset stomach with the combination of peppermint and wonderful licorice.

This particular flavor is my absolute favorite. The combination is sweet and satisfying.  I don't even add sweetness because it is not needed!

This year is refreshing and sweet-tasting. I absolutely love it. If you like licorice you will like this.

I love this tea. I never liked licorice so I never would have thought I would like a licorice and peppermint tea but the flavor is so nice.  Very mild and lightly and naturally sweet.  This tea is very good for when you have a couph or sinus issues. I love having a cup when I'm winding down for bed.

Pukka is one of those brands that offers tea in a natural bag that doesn't leak plastics when seeped in hot water (as too many tea brands do). This flavor is sweet, with no added sugar or sweetener - and warmly refreshing.

Discovered this tea at Publix but no longer carry it locally. So thrilled I can order on Amazon. Best tea on earth for me! No caffeine but lively flavor that soothes my nerves and is sweet without calories or artificial sweetening. Love it!

I heard about this tea on a podcast. This is my favorite flavored tea - and I’ve convinced several of my friends to try it, too.

A wonderful after dinner tea.

I bought this tea after reading the reviews saying it is similar to the Aveda Salon tea. It really is good. Nice flavor and it does remind me of Aveda tea but at a much better price. I've noticed that this brand is hit-or-miss with the strength of a flavor and this is one of the better ones. I recommend trying it without any sweetener first.Its actually better without. So great for someone staying away from sugar and still wanting flavor.

My mom kept seeing references to peppermint and licorice tea in some book she was reading. She was very curious about it, so I did an amazon search and came up with this product. I surprised mom with it... and she loves it! So much that I've bought a second box for her. Both times,the product arrived much sooner than the arrive-by date. I'm very happy with the service, and mom is very happy with the tea. Win-win.

Listen…. I don’t like tea, or licorice or peppermint… but someone told me this tea was great to cure sweet cravings. I CANT BELIEVE HOW DELICIOUS IT IS! Seriously! I look forward to having a cup each night before bed now.

Three sips in and I had to order another box. I do NOT like tea, but I love this. Nice, mild, sweet mint flavor on the sip with a hint of anise aftertaste. Thin/watery, but good. Beautiful and mild... if you're looking for a black licorice bite, then look elsewhere.

I wish it was easier to find this in the US. I bought this and had it sent from England. That's okay though, well worth the wait. However I need to stock up because it turns out everyone at home ended up loving it just as much as me, so one packet lasted about a week! Love love love. Sweet and perfect after food!

Read about this flavor tea in a mystery novel, sounded good so I searched it out.At Amazon naturally! Try it you'll love it.

If you are looking for high quality ingredients, plain and simple, this is for you.  It is just licorice root and peppermint.  There are no added flavors and it is not sweetened.  I love it and go out of my way to find it wherever I can because it is not sold in my local supermarket.I have also met people who strongly do not like this tea.  If you tend to like Celestial Seasonings, which is engineered with lots of flavors for the average palate, you may not like this tea.

Good value & great flavor.

I LOVE this tea.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it's just been perfect.  I tried Stash mint licorice tea and it was all mint.  You have a customer for life.  Thanks!

I love this tea. My daughter and family like it too. It is sweet tasting; great for after a meal.  The packaging is so pretty. Follow the instructions for brewing for the best taste. I am sending it in a package of Christmas gifts this year.

I love this tea. Sweet but herbaceous always. It's amazing hot or iced. Really calms me after a hard day and good for those trying to quick the sugar dragon. Highly recommended. Also doesn't have stevia like other licorice teas.

Can’t find it in stores anymore. So delicious

Wonderful sweet treat before bed without adding any extra calories

Not a licorice fan but LOVE this flavor combo!!

If you are a tea lover.. you must try this.  It is fantastic. It smells so much like licorice!  It was recommended to me by a friend who loves teas. (I am trying to cut back on dessert) and this is a great dessert tea with no sugar or honey of course.

THIS IS A REALLY NIFTY, NOT OVERWHELMING COMBO OF FLAVORS.

I love this tea. It’s the only one I’ve tried that tastes the best and helps my stomach the most

Full but subtle taste.  Perfect.

The peppermint licorice tea is the best! Naturally sweet without sugar, it helps curb my sweet tooth. This reminds me of the tea at Aveda salons and a similar peppermint licorice tea that Central Market used to carry but has apparently discontinued. This will be my new go-to!

I think I'm in the minority when I say for me the licorice taste definitely takes a backseat to the peppermint. This is still a really good tea and I would definitely buy again.

Love this tea! I was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed this tea. I ended up purchasing a few other flavors from this company and have been pleasantly surprised.

This the best tea I have had in my life. It is the perfect combination of flavors with a slight sweetness from the licorice so no other sweetener is needed. Great hot and iced.

Peppermint with licorice - did not think I would like. I love it

This is a wonderfully smelling tea.. The flavor is peppermint and licorice, the taste is of both. No sugar needed as the flavor is sweet.  A calming enjoyable cup of tea in the morning or evening.

my husband & I wind down our day with the Pukka teas ,we love them!!

I love this tea as it is two of most favorite flavors - licorice and peppermint. I usually drink before bedtime.

Love this tea.  I am a huge licorice fan and this tea really delivers.  Linging long after you have swallowed - nice full robust flavor.  Really enjoying it.  Thank you!

This is super flavorful. Very equivalent to Yogi or Aveda’s version.

Not an easy combo to find but glad they make it!

I just think the tea is delicious.  I love it.  Especially a cup before I go to bed.  Thank you for a great product.

I bought this coconut oil and received it and it had brown spots inside and didn’t look right at all. Then I looked at the expiration date and it said it expired in December 2024. That’s in a little more than 3 months. It was manufactured in 2022. So it’s been sitting on a shelf somewhere for almost 2 years. And there is no way to return or exchange it. Very disappointed. I love Dr Bronner’s products usually and am shocked at the low quality of this coconut oil.

The “ oil “ arrived completely liquid and looked like dirty water. My coconut has never looked like this before without an ounce of solid.

The jar I received has a stinky smell, not like pure coconut oil that I've purchased in the past. I wanted to return it but was told it can't be returned.  I also expressed concern over just receiving it with an expiration of Aug. 2019. This is May, 2019.  Maybe it is old? If I cannot get a refund or a replacement jar that is good, I will not be re-ordering and I would not recommend.

Jar arrived broken (with bits of glass floating the bubble wrap and certainly mixed in the product) and product leaking all over wrapping and box. Went to request replacement item and found that this item is ineligible for return. I recognize why that would be but I’m frustrated that there isn’t a better way to get a new item without paying for it again since the first is unusable.

Product received expires 4/21 which seems pretty soon also when I noticed the discoloration at the top I removed the label to see how far down it goes and there were 2 labels- one on top of the other like an old product was relabeled with an updated label

I have bought this product/brand in larger bottles many times from a local supermarket.  The supermarket stopped carrying the product so I ordered it from the Amazon.  The bottles I bought at the supermarket were the same color from top to bottom however, the bottles purchased from Amazon seemed to be very old or something problematic with them since the color at the bottom was off white/tan.

I love this product but the expiration date and it has past. The jar had leaked and it was liquid... It is suppose to be solid. Unsafe to use. There are no options to obtain a refund.... How do I get a refund

Unfortunately my product  came in with broken glass. Product is in a glass container.so you know how that go, but anyway I cut myself while moving the product to another container and that was just too much sooooo yeah . I got out what I can that day.

this packaging was horrible my jar was busted. Good thing I had another mason jar, crazy thing is I love Dr. Bronner’s products but when this coconut 🥥 oil arrived I was HIGHLY disappointed!

I ordered this and it came totally liquified and clear.  Seems like it was left in the heat too long.  There are white beads at the bottom.  Very disappointed that I cannot get a replacement.

I’ve purchased this brand before and never had problems. Unfortunately, this bottle arrived totally liquid and as it has set up is very chunky with hard bits that won’t smooth out. I’m not sure if it was old or damaged.

Just received the jar today and it expires in 4 months. It was manufactured  march 2018 and expires September 2019. It’s currently April 2019. Or $16 I want to get more than four months use out of it .

Thought i was getting the 30 oz for what this dinky jar cost me!! Buyer beware! I can get this same brand elsewhere for a 30 oz for the same price! 😡 I didnt even want to give this ANY stars at all!!!

Due to the potential for glass introduced to the product it can not be used to moisturize nor ingest without compromising safety.

The product arrived undamaged and still sealed and with a valid expiration date however, the contents were clearly “not right”.

I ordered white kernel and received whole kernel and now I’m just stuck with it. Very disappointed.

It had mold growing in it

It smelled awful. I believe I received one that had spoiled somehow. The jar was intact, but it just did not smell right.

- Bottom of the bottle is brown. Not sure if it’s spoiled- The product is also going to expire in next few months.

Received bottle that will expire well before I’m able to use it. Going in the trash since i cant return.

I was very sad... Product arrived in too large of a box. Was bounced around. Broke in transit

Glass container arrived broken

Received it in delivery and its passed 1 month since it expired! No way of getting a returning or refunding!

I HAVE ANTS AND BUGS ALL OVER MY HOUSE FROM THIS JAR.... IT REEKS OF COCONUT.If only this company had the courage to just say "we're too cheap to take off the brown shell" instead of pumping it up with "nuttier taste!"Yeah I said it. And their castile soaps are garbage as well. Just leaves your skin super dry.

I received the oil today and the BB date was for January 2024. Returned.

Received this coconut oil on October 11 .Product expire date October 29. 18 days to use all before expire...not cool. Cannot return item.

Happy with the product. However, it was manufactured in May of 2019 and expires November 2020. I ordered and received this item in July 2020. So, I will only have 4 months to use this item with an 18 month shelf life.

This wasn't so bad I threw out the bottle, but mine came with strange crystals in it and brown discoloration at the bottom of the jar. I used this as moisturizer but wouldn't use it for cooking due to the irregularities.

Unattractive price when shipping price is added which is higher than oil.I don't think to order anymore!

If I didn’t have a spare jar ur ass would be mine!

The coconut oil is fine but the only reason I purchased this oil specifically was because multiple reviews said that the container it comes in is glass. Mine came in a plastic one.

Good oil but too expensive. I can buy it from Costco for the same price but 5X  oil.

Two out the the three products were broken when I open the box. Not happy

I have always ordered the “white kernel” Dr Bronners coconut oil. I use it for a moisturizer for my face, which is VERY sensitive (this is the *only* stuff I can use to not get breakouts). 2x in a row, I’ve ordered the white kernel (what is shown) but have received whole kernel. It is NOT the same. It smells different, has a different consistency, and is giving me consistent breakouts. I haven’t even opened the second jar (from the second purchase where they sent me the wrong stuff), and I can’t return it. So disappointed, because it isn’t cheap, as far as coconut oil goes.

The product I received was very runny and I noticed that it expired in July 2020 (it’s nearly May) so I know I won’t be able to use it all by then and think that it is extra runny due to it being manufactured in Jan 2019

I bought in january of 2021.  It was manufactured in october of 2019 and has an expiration date of april 30 2021.  I only have 3 1/2 months to use.

My jar came broken. Lots of glass everywhere, so it’s not salvageable. When I went to exchange, says this item it not eligible for an exchange?

This product is Expeller oil, meaning-- the oil gets heated up at extreamly high tempertaures; as results the product looses both valuable nutrients and benefits.  Look for cold pressed, there is no meaning behing magic pressed means expeller pressed.  They use tricky wording to confuse buyers, so be aware and do your homework.

In general this is a great company for coconut oil,  I had to return it cuz the expiration date was  supposed expired and couple of months /:

I found it cheaper at Lucky's supermarket. This expires in September 2016 and its got brown stuff at the bottom I have no idea what it is, but I always kept it in my cabinet.

I bought this stuff in Hawaii and loves cooking with it. I gave it a low ratings because the package was damaged when it arrived.

I orderd 2 i got 1

It'sokay

Coconut oil is good for your teeth, just use it in the morning, 1 teaspoon swished around in mouth for about 5 minutes and spit out

Can't tell the difference between Magic Fresh and
Dr. Bronner's - Fair Trade & Organic Fresh Pressed White Kernel Virgin Coconut Oil - 14 oz
. Doesn't justify the price increase. That being said, its still tastes great.

Very strong coconut flavor/odor. But tastes great in smoothies and works as expected :) first time trying this brand and I'm pretty pleased

Ok product. Would buy again if needed.

expensive for the size you get.

Easy to spoon at cool room temp, coconut smell and flavor is there as opposed to other brands.  Very tasty for an oil.  I bought at my local grocery for $7 less than the price on Amazon, otherwise I would order it here.  Very rare for me that Amazon gets beat and beat badly on cost.

Super fresh and pure. I’ve been using it for everything, from cooking to baking, and it adds such a nice, subtle flavor to my dishes.

This was the first coconut oil I ever tried. I use coconut oil as a deep conditioning treatment for my hair. I simply slather it on, massage my scalp, give my hair enough time to slurp it up, and then wash out with a gentle, all-natural conditioner. This coconut oil is of very high quality and has given me amazing results. The health and strength of my hair has significantly improved, and notice a lot of new hair growth. The rest of my hair has grown quite noticeably. Even though I think this is a wonderful product, I didn't re-purchase because I found Nature's Way to be less expensive/same prince for twice the amount of product - and the oil is just as good, if not a little better. The one thing I definitely like about this coconut oil better is the jar. Very nice, safe packaging and leaves me with a cute jar when the coconut oil is gone.

I use this for skin care, mainly on my face.  It feels so good, smells fantastic, does not clog my pores and the fact that it's organic and 100% pure is very important to me.  I use this as part of my skin care routine as well as a mixture of essential oils and my face has never looked better.  I highly recommend anyone considering buying this to do so, you won't regret it.

I use this oil on my daughter hair and it works great i love it.

It smells great. Finally I found real coconut oil

You just can not go wrong with this brand, every product in the Dr. Bronner line we have used is excellent quality.  No disappointments in this line of products, you should try it!

Love, love, love. usually not a fan of coconut anything (this definitely smells like coconut!), but I love this product. I use it daily on my hair & skin. Skin feels so much smoother after 1 week. This glass bottle is perfect for storage. Please remember that the consistency of this item is based on the temperature of the storage area. It can be liquid or it can be solid. Mixes well either way. I love to mix it with my all time favorite product Genes Vitamin E Crème, which I use daily!!!

The best ever coconut oil. I use this on EVERYTHING. The only thing i have not done is cooked with it, and i see people do it all the time. I have tried alot of other oils and i always come back to the Dr.Bonners. It also may cost a tad bit more than  could get than aldis but it just seems to be better and go further at Dr.Bonners. When i am using a good coconut oil i will use it on cuts, sores, rashes, swelling and the all of above. I also like that this is vegan and organic.

I eat coconut oil like my life depends on it.  This is my favorite brand since you can always trust Dr. Bronners and also because this particular one comes in a glass jar.  Yes, it's a little more dicey for klutzy people, which I can be, but I know that nothing bad leached.  Also, I have experienced mold with other brands (Natures Way and Jarrow once), haven't experienced it with Dr. Bronners.  This should be a subscription item-- I eat a lot of it.  Feel great.  Use it on my skin too.  :)

I buy this brand to eat directly out of the jar. This white kernnel oil is delicious. The texture varies on it tho, some jars smooth, some jars gritty and sometimes even brown at the bottom but the taste of it is delicious and consistent!

If your planning to use this for bod and haircare then you can’t go wrong with Dr. B. The only caution I would give is to make sure your turn it upside down once you start running low (so it solidifies with the majority at the top of the jar). The circular top makes it hard to get your hand in without breaking it.

I adore this product. It’s the only brand I’m interest in buying. However this price is a rip-off. You can buy 30 ounces directly from Dr Bronner’s for $21.99. When this itty bitty jar showed up in my Amazon delivery box I was surprised how small it was and googled Dr Bronners to find their own website. Ugh, buyer beware.

Quality of the product is apparent from the taste and the scent. Highly recommend! I use it for cooking but occasionally put it in my hair as a hair mask for a few hours. The health and beauty benefits of coconut oil are endless if you look into it, and this is a great brand to go with if you are seeking to reap these benefits as best you can.

This coconut oil tastes like coconut. That's for sure. I use it occasionally to cook (I use butter or ghee for the most part), but for the most part I use this for homemade beauty products and I substitute it for whatever fat is called for when I'm baking sweets. It is subtle, but it adds a sweet coconut flavor to anything I bake it into.

Really delicious and helped us to get the mother-in-law (87 years old) to start drinking smoothies daily!! (In fact she can't wait for her coconut "treat" after lunch.) My husband says her mind has cleared and she has more energy. I can't tell you that it's all from the coconut oil since this is only one of many ingredients in her smoothie, of course, but you can't beat the quality and that it's fresh-pressed. Great product.

Dr. Bronner's OVCO is one of the best, if not the best, tasting coconut oils available. We often buy and use coconut oil for anything from cooking to skin protection, but this product is the one we reserve for the kitchen! Try it whipped into your coffee. It is delicious!

Love it! I cook most of my food with this product and love the flavor it adds to the meal.  I’ve used many coconut oils in the past and by far this is my top pick!

I love Dr. Bronners! I have used their soaps in the past and have not always been satisfied, but I appreciate their values I decided to give the another try. The coconut oil smells great. I use it on my hair and I use it for cooking. It leaves my hair shiny, frizz free, and curly! It makes food taste great. I am really satisfied with this product.

I was looking for a natural leather conditioner for my beeswax shoes. One of my friends recommended using coconut oil instead. After two uses,  I couldn't be happier. The oil leaves a nice finish and a good looking coat. I'd suggest placing the jar in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up first.

I’ve been buying other brands of coconut oil for years and somebody recommended this. It’s far superior to the others brands I’ve tried. It smells better and feels so much better on my face. I’m a convert!

Bought this mostly because it's fair trade, and I'm glad I did! I use it to make body butter and to cook food with (works perfectly for both). Has a really nice true coconut scent. If you're looking for actual coconut oil, this is the perfect choice.

I use this coconut oil daily as a moisturizer and it makes my skin feel very smooth!

I use this to remove my water proof mascara everynight. We all know how tough that is, this does it without any problem and it leaves the skin around my eyes so moisturized. I am happy to not be using any harsh chemicals on my eyes to remove makeup and it works perfectly .

This is the best coconut oil on the market.  I love it, my dog loves it and so does my cat.  We use it for everything.  It has a nice texture and the flavor is great.

I don't use this product for for stir-frying, making sauces, or baking, but I can say my hair stays laid thanks to the moisturizing effects for Dr. Bronner's coconut oil. Melts in your hands so there's no need to warm it up (unless that's your thing). From root to tip it works wonders.

Definitely my favorite brand of coconut oil, unsure how price compares as I cannot find it in any local stores near me

The best coconut oil I’ve found so far. I love the smooth texture and how it feels on my face and hands.

I use this for cooking, moisturizer, tanning oil, makeup remover, etc. It’s the best brand and lasts forever. Amazing!

It is mild and a good butter that doesn't have a nauseating coconut taste

Love this as a skin moisturizer post surgery.

I love this Coconut Oil! I use it in my beauty routine. It smells great and doesn't cause any breakouts.

I love it! The reason I use this is because my legs chafe and nothing ever seems to work but this for me. It lasts me quite some time. I just hate the smell , but since it's on my thighs I'm okay.

Tried this for the first time today! I am writing a review right away because i this this oil was soooo amazin! i loved how it smelled and it made my hair super duper soft and shiny after one use! Cant wait to use it more often!

I never tried coconut oil in diet.  It was recommended by nutritionist.  Tastes really good.

I am using this product as a moisturizer on my face. @younghouselove introduced me to it. I LOVE it!!

Great.  I use it on my and my babies skin.  Exactly what I wanted

This coconut smells and tastes so fresh! I love the size,  too.

Love this stuff. I use this instead of lotion.makes my skin feel so soft and supple and a nice sheen. I love the smell it's a deeper coconut smell not just the usual sweet coconut smell.

Product came impeccably well due to proper care in wrapping it in bubble wrap before shipping. This is good stuff too! Smells amazing. Plan on using it for my hair and dry skin. Thank you! Will be ordering again when needed!

Broken jar so glass mixed in with oil so have to reorder! Thank you Martha Silver

Dr. Bronner's is the best line of toiletries ever. The coconut oil is no exception.

My favorite coconut oil! I have brought this many times and got my whole family into this product! Smells great and works amazing! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE !

Never fails to disappoint. I use it for my hair as a bi monthly treatment. A natural, curly girl's dream come true. Great for post shower moisturizing and shaving too! Also lasts you MONTHS.

Great product..i used on my natural curly hair and it makes my hair so soft. My husband uses it on his beard and it puts a shine to her. I will buy again.

I use this product daily in my coffee.

I use it exclusively as a facial moisturizer. It’s amazing.

we use it for face and all over for someone with psoriasis ...love it

I've tried Nutiva and Trader Joe's coconut oil, but I rank Dr. Bronner's above them all. They always leave me well satisfied with my purchase and I will continue to be a faithful costumer of Dr. Bronner's!

one of the best coconut oils that I used so far. It smells better and spreads better than other coconut oils I have used. I will definitely buy this company again, even if it's pricier.

can't go wrong with Dr. Bronner's ...use this stuff for everything from cooking to skincare...and I trust this brand and the quality.

I received the oil and before checking the date, which expired July of 2022….I started using it for oil pulling and as a supplement. I noticed my stomach not feeling the best after ingestion but attributed that to other things. Now that the weather is warm and the oil is no longer solid the last few times I used it I got sick but still hadn’t made the connection until the very last time when I ended throwing up it made me so ill. I’m reaching out to Amazon for a refund and can’t imagine buying this again after receiving an expired product by 2 years!! Some serious quality control issues here.

I ordered this Coconut Oil due to its quality.  However it was delivered broken at my door not in the mailbox as was stated.  I looked to have it replaced and received a message stated it cannot be returned or replaced.  I want my money back

If you have type 4 hair or curly hair please do NOT use this. I ran out of this and bought extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil, and the texture of my hair literally changed into how it used to be. This company is scamming people because their coconut oil dries your hair out so you end up buying more. I can’t believe I was using this stuff. I’m so happy and thankful I realized this stuff was absolutely horrible.

Arrived shattered and leaking everywhere.

Received the package today. The jar of coconut oil was broken and cannot be used and there are no refunds. Very frustrating

My product arrived broken. Item was not allowed a return or refund. I tried contacting the seller, they never reach back out to me. I went as far as contacting Dr. Bronners company and they stated they didn't support this seller so it was out of their hands. This stuff isn't cheap. I will never buy from this company again.

Love the product but can’t use because it came shattered and I can’t return it.

Just finished my old jar of this about a week ago and had this one for backstock. I’ve went through maybe 5 of these over the past couple of years and have been really happy with them all. This last one the first top 2-3 inches of the jar have been grainy pieces that do not melt fully. I use this for body lotions I make and since these pieces won’t melt no matter how long I try to make them the top 3 inches have been useless to me. Really disappointed in this jar.

I received my jar of Dr Bronners coconut oil lid was damaged where it is damaged coconut oil its turning brown and some had leaked out of jar. I tried to contact company with no luck . I would not buy again very disappointed twith them .

The jar was carefully wrapped in bubble wrap but the lid wasn’t on tight. Because of the heat in our area at this time of year, the coconut oil liquified (which is normal for coconut oil in heat), but because the lid wasn’t on tight, the bubble wrap was full of coconut oil. 😢 It would’ve been better if someone had made sure the lid was on tight.

I ❤️ this product…. However I reordered two large jars and both were in the samePackage thinly bubbled and one whole jar is gone becasuse it broke from the lack of packaging. And my mailbox is completely oiled but smells great. Wasted money as there is no return.

I have bought this product a number of times but the last order arrived wrapped in thin green bubble wrap and in pieces -  smashed glass.  Completely unusable- I couldn’t even finish I wrapping to look at it because the prices were so small.  Lucky I didn’t cut my fingers.  There is no way to return the product.  Not happy.

Have not tried yet but disappointed it has a  Manufactured date of 9/21 and use by date of 3/23.  I know, that’s nine months away, but it’s a big jar.  Would have liked to have received one closer to manufactured date.

25$ wasted on a broken jar of coconut oil. Tried to salvage a little bit but cut myself 3x on the glass. Shipper wrapped one thin layer of bubble wrap and put it into a box that was too big. Jar just slammed around. Buy a different brand.

This item was delivered 3 days before the expiration date, although it was manufactured a year and a half earlier. I would have never thought to check the expiration date upon arrival, but just happened to notice that it expired a couple months ago. I then checked my orders only to find that it expired right as we received it. Too late to do anything now, but very disappointed.

Came with the seal broken and parts of it are discolored. I won’t be using or tasting this, and I am highly disappointed as I was going to use this for a recipe I was making Wednesday.

Product arrived with  a ding on the aluminium lid. This makes impossible to open it plus the oil was leaking all over the container. I had to open it with tools and was definitely dangerous and not smart to do so but i needed it right away for my recipe .

2 jars of coconut oil arrived broken and spilled all over my other things.  There’s apparently no return possible?  I’d like this to be fixed.  Please advise.

My product arrived damaged and there’s no where for me to message the retailer that I can see. The top was off and class container is shattered with bits of glass in the coconut oil. Normally I love this product!

I love this product and decided to order more; however this time it arrived broken. It was in nice bubble wrap but still broken.

Like this product but arrived in a broken jar. Was glad to get a refund.

Glass jar was broken when I unwrapped and took product out of the box, glass shards fell out into my floor

I received my order very quickly. The problem is that the coconut oil was pull date February 14,2020. This is usually a very good product but I am disappointed that I was sent a pull dated product.

The Dr. Bronzers Organic Coconut glass jar was broken. While I understand the return policy, I don’t see a replacement option.

My product came all busted up . The glass is broken and since I can’t return it I was hoping to have it replaced . Thank you for looking into this matter , sincerely Donna Hadley

Bought a 30 oz jar in April, best by date reads June. The jar was already 10 months old. There's no way I can use almost two pounds of coconut oil in 2 months.

This stuff is brown and smells bad and is NON replaceable or refundable some how. What a horrible food transaction, boo Amazon!!!!!

When I received the item the jar was shattered. Do not see any disclosure about item not being returnable. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I wouldn't take the risk.

Please give me my money back. This item is expired by more than a month and not usable. I’m very disappointed!!!

Glass came broken, with some coconut oil seeping out. Not eligible for return.

It's the product I want, but the bottle was leaking when arrived and the oil was all over the package. And there is no return/refund option!!!!

This item was broken on arrival. Such a disappointment.

I need a replacement

This item arrived broken and apparently I cannot return it!

Item damaged all broken up

Would have given it 5 stars; however, I received a rancid batch and was unable to return.

The item arrived broken. Would like a full refund.

Why ship a poduct that has i high probability of breaking without packing it like you should. Poor customer service a real blight on a good product. Sad.

Honestly the worst coconut oil I ever bought. I don't even know how they manage to make a coconut oil bad, but this coconut oil smells terrible and it tastes even worse. I've been using coconut oil for years and this is the only one I can honestly say that I hated. Don't buy it. It tastes awful.

I HAVE ANTS AND BUGS ALL OVER THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF THIS JAR!If only this company had the courage to say "we're too cheap to take off the brown shell" instead of pumping it up with "nuttier taste!"Yeah I said it. Their castile soaps are garbage as well...

Arrived with bottom of glass jar shattered with shards of glass mixed into coconut oil. This is my favorite coconut oil! I’m so disappointed....had to throw it in the garbage. I hope shipper sees this & will replace it.

Within a day, turned liquid. no big dealwithin two weeks, turned into curled milknice. real nice.

Great oil only not a good idea to buy during the summer container doesn't do well. No returns!

LOVE this cocounut oil and its endless uses! Recently started feeding to my dogs and cats daily and they absolutely love it as well! So many  health benefits, it is a miracle oil!I buy this on the regular, but this last time I received it and it had leaked all over inside the wrapping... It had the safety seal on it, but the cap must have been loose. Not impressed with the mess and no way to contact seller.

Old stock very close to expiration date

Item came broken all in the box. Couldn’t even use it.

I have never had coconut oil like this. It is liquid and solid at the same time. The center of the jar is like vegetable oil.The solids taste like candle wax. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is a spoiled jar but I will not purchase again.....

Lid and plastic damaged although wrapped in bubble wrap it leaked out upon arrival. Otherwise great product

The product is good. It lacks that milky white appearance though. Although it says "unrefined" it feels more like half way between virgin and refined. It has that coconut smell, but it is faint. Still, an authentic product none the less. I wonder if the extraction procedure is to blame for loss of potency. Also there is no rubber seal on the lid. Although tight, it doesn't feel AIRTIGHT.

Received this coconut oil today and I like it, though I don't noticed difference in taste, texture, or smell compared to the Nutiva I had purchased for a lot less $$.  The oil at the bottom of the jar is a little yellow..  wondering if it's supposed to be like that?  Maybe some settling occurred?Also, a little disappointed that the jar I received was packed on 6/12/14, so it's almost a year old and expires in December of this year...

This is a great product, but on the day I received my order the product was a year old and it expires in 6 months. I will not buy from amazon again.

The coconut flavor and smell I like is a little weak.

it's coconut oil

I like the product but the first shipment glass jars shattered on one and I cut finger. Amazon paid to ship again but same packaging with a small amount of bubble wrap. Luckily it was inside a box that had other items. Improve the shipping please.

something changed in the product it used to be chunky now seems more smooth, i dont know what that means but i think it was a more raw form before smelled stronger....

I love they use glass.  I've bought coconut oil in plastic, which I hate, not only because plastic is destroying the planet but there is no way to get the last of the product out of a plastic jar.  I can put Dr. Bronner's coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds and melt the remaining oil and use it.  If I try that with plastic, the plastic meltws and folds up into a mess, and I'm afraid to eat the oil because of the plastic.  It's crazy though that those who use plastic, use an excellent cap that is totally unnecessary for a plastic bottle but it would be great if Dr. Bronners would use that kind of cap.  Bronners uses a cap that would work well on a plastic bottle but prevents the beautiful glass bottle they use from being a good storage container.  I ended up taking the cap used on plastic and replaced the cheap cap Bronner uses.  Bronner ought to use a cap with a seal inside the cap so it can be screwed down tight so the consumer can reuse the excellent glass bottle.  Maybe they could swap all their cheap caps to the plastic company and have the plastic company send them their excellent caps, which serve no function on a plastic bottle but would turn Bronner's glass bottles into excellent storage containers.

I don't even like coconut oil. But this one tastes great. Awesome to cook with. Much nuttier flavor. If you wanna do oil pulling or whatever with coconut oil, but you don't really like coconuts, this is the jar to go with.

Great product for your hair!It was recommended on a Youtube video so I decided to try it. I leave it over night. Only issue is that you must wash your hair twice after applying it otherwise your hair will be horribly greasy.Overall, love it! Smells great and it makes your hair feel and look great!

Great product but found $4.00 less at a local store.

I love the smell of this coconut oil

Other than the jar being utterly impossible to open without a adjustable plumbers/pliers wrench, it's the same high quality I've come to expect from Bronners.

I love this coconut oil !! It’s pure and it’s delicious

For years, I have tried to find a coconut oil that actually tasted and smelled like coconut. This stuff is absolutely wonderful. Don’t hesitate just buy it! Yes, it is pricier than the others but it is so good. I put it in my coffee, I put it in my toast, I put it on my daughters, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and she loves it! I even give a spoonful to my dog as a treat once a week.

Have been purchasing products from Dr. Bronner since the 1970s and every product is above and beyond in quality , ease of use and value for money.I ave ordered and used other coconut oil products on my skin and hair but in terms of ease of use and the condition of my skin and hair with continued use nothing measures up to these products .

This is a long time go to. I use it for cooking. It is clean and safe.

Been using and buying various brands of coconut oil for year.Finally found Dr. Bronner's - Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, andI can say (as a self appointed expert) this oil is as good as it gets.If you like pancakes as I do; this is a secret ingredient.  If youdon't care about pancakes - put it on your face.  It's the best!

Dr. Bronner's - Organic Virgin Coconut Oil works wonders on my hair! For over a year now I have been using the coconut oil as a weekly hair mask for my curly hair. Pryor to the oil I found my hair to have a lot of breakage at the midway point. With this oil and a year of use has fixed the problem. It has also strengthened my hair and added moisture for the week... Can't and won't stop using this!

Love this stuff! Use it all over as a moisturizer, cook with it, sometimes brush my teeth with it. It's great quality! No complaints.

See photo. I contacted Dr. Bronners about the brown discoloration as I have bought this item many times through the years, but hadn't seen the brown before. I received a very quick response and no further updates is good news, as if there does turn out to be evidenceof an issue after I open the jar, I'll update my review if Amazon Allows: "Please rest assured that sediment is normal, and can sometimes be a golden yellow, or even brown color. Any virgin coconut oil that is made using a dry process, including Dr. Bronner’s,  has visible sediment in the oil as it comes from the expeller press. Each batch will vary, meaning some may have more sediment than others, and some may not have sediment at all. That sediment is usually filtered out in a multi-stage filter process. Since we air-dry the coconut flesh at temperatures around 220 C, some caramelization occurs during the drying and makes the sediment slightly brownish. When you taste it you’ll notice a slight caramel flavor. In the past we’ve occasionally had slippage of the very fine sediment through the filtration system. That’s what you see at the bottom of the jar. It’s similar to the kind of sediment you may see in a virgin olive oil, or other “native oils" when you put them in the fridge. Also, gray translucent spots are also normal. These are natural occurring shadows that are present in Coconut Oil. Sometimes they also appear in a honeycomb pattern."In any case, I've always been pleased with this product and love that the packaging is nontoxic and sustainable.

Love this coconut oil, so versatile! Also very happy that it is organic and in a glass container.

Once you taste and smell this coconut oil, you will understand Dr. Bronner's is the best and worth every penny.

Great flavor. A lot for the cost.

Love this product, quality is amazing! Will buy it again

Very good

I love, love, love coconut oil. My face loves it, only at night and my body rejoices over it, only during the day. I would love to wear at night, but my sheets will be ruined, unless I wait an hour before bedtime.I usually drink a tablespoon each morning and it is delicious in my cup of coffee.

While being treated for a diabetic foot ulcer, I mentioned to my Podiatrist that I was experiencing itching around my ulcer and asked him what he recommended I do to address it. He suggested using Dr. Bronner's Virgin Coconut Oil. Not only can it be used for cooking, but it also works as an anti-itch cream, and he said his wife swears by it. Another of my DPM's patients is a woman from India. She said many Indians use coconut oil to relieve itching. It has been a godsend for me. I use it at bedtime to help me sleep and before going to work to be sure I'm comfortable. It helps immensely.

Liked that it arrived on time

Baby, my OBGYN put me on to this and I love it. Especially for my intimate area.  Great recommend for older sexually active ladies. It helps with the dryness.

this is delicous.... I have not put it on my skin because it feels weird to cook and rub the same thing on my body

Buy this brand only if you want the very best. Taste exactly like a fresh Coconut and smells like one.

This is my favorite coconut oil, it smells so good I want to eat it. I know you can use it for cooking, too, but I use as body and hair moisturizer and it is the BEST. It is expensive, but lasts a long time.

Absolutely LOVE Dr. Bronner’s coconut oil. I have used it for years and will not buy anything else. It is pure and Excellent for so many different uses. I use it as a moisturizer, for bug bites, insect repellent, hair conditioner, makeup remover, leather moisturizer, cooking, in smoothies, you name it. My son is a Teenager and has some acne. He started using it at night as a moisturizer because the acne medication was drying out his skin. It has worked wonders for his skin! He said it is So soothing and the acne is gone! He was able to stop using the medication and just uses the coconut oil. Most people wouldn’t think of putting an oil on your face but Dr. Bronner’s unrefined is just that, unrefined and Full of nutrients. It may have some course pieces from time to time but that is because it is pure, no additives. My most recently  purchased jar is so smooth and melts into the skin like butter! Absolutely incredible and soothing! Love this stuff!

Love it! Perfect for cooking, coffee, and more!  Smells great, works well with heat, and price is fair!

Nothing better than the Bonner's Virgin Coconut oil. I have tried several of the coconut oils and and this one is by far the best of all of them. It is wonderful to cook with or to just use as a medical rub. Heals sores almost over night. Detoxes and kills germs. Muscle aches and pains (helps naturally detox, heal and replenish the body) Calms you down to sleep.I don't think that there is anything that this does not cure or make just a little bit better. I also like giving my dog a taste every now and then to make sure she stays healthy. She had a bad skin infection last summer where she lost a big patch of her hair and the vet called it a stress problem, she is doing so much better after the Bonner's Coconut oil treatment and her hair is even growing back nice and thick.It is just one great product!

I like that it comes in a glass jar so no contaminates develop like it would if it was in a plastic container.

Love, love the taste and quality of this product!

I really like the flavor. A bit nutty, and sautées well.

I just got my jar in the mail today. I originally bought it for my hair, but after doing some research I'm using it for many other reasons. I started losing my voice last night and today it only got worse. I put a tablespoon in with my tea and within 10 minutes my voice started coming back! It's amazing. I also used it as a conditioning mask for my hair and now my hair has more volume and is very soft. I also used it for oil pulling  (yes, I went VCO crazy today) and the taste was almost non existent. My pest control guy came over today and saw my jar and told me he has lost 13 inches around his stomach just by having 4 tbsp of the VCO everyday so I also ate a tbsp. So far, in the few short hours I've had it, I love it!

This coconut oil is really fantastic! It smells amazing haven't cooked with it yet but on your skin and in your hair it's another world. Leaves my skin soft and my hair with a wonderful shine said lush softness

Great product and fast shipping!

This product is amazing !! I use it on my hair, my skin, for cooking, for salves and tinctures. It really is a top quality product.

Wow, I heard it said that you can tell the difference in really good coconut oil and the crummy stuff, but this proves it to me. You see, this is hugely expensive and I almost didn't try it, but I tell you, the first time I made a simple stir-fry of pork, water chestnuts, zucchini, and bamboo shoots sauteed in Dr. Bronner's  (I'm very restricted right now), well, it tasted like I used a whole can of coconut milk in the recipe, the flavor was that fantastic! I meant to keep leftovers for the next meal, but I couldn't stop savoring those great flavors made with this coconut oil. In my case, I probably won't be able to purchase this again, or very often, due to cost, but suffice it to say that I will if I can, its that yummy!!

I’ve used this coconut oil for last seven years. I’ve have tried others but I always come back to this one.

Perfect for skin, hair, and internal remedies!

In my opinion, this is the best organic, cold-pressed Coconut Oil I have tried.  And I have tried most sold in U.S.  I use it for oil-pulling, in my Vegan/Keto Coffee, Protein Shakes, and all my cooking.  It blends well for cold and hot foods.  I like that it is in a glass jar instead of plastic.  The flavor is mild.  The light aroma is pleasant.  Once you try this brand, you will not settle for anything less.

While I love coconut I love that this brand is not overpowering my my recipes.  I don't use this for moisturizing only for cooking

Just opening the jar caused my mouth to salivate for the rich nutty taste of this product. The moisturizing affect left my skin and senses in a luxurious state and a craving for more!

Best Coconut oil on the market. The purest and the best for the environment!! Dr. Bronners is the best quality and is fair trade which is important to me.

I love  this product for overall health. I actually stopped eating butter and put this oil on my toast. DELICIOUS

The flavor is very good and I'm looking forward to the desired memory and cognitive function improvements that are possible, but the packaging needs to be improved to avoid glass breakage during shipping

This is the best. Costco sells the same thing, 84 ounces for the same price as Dr. Bronner's 30 ounces at Amazon. Costco's is very good. It is not whole kernel, and it is not Free Trade. Everything else is the same. Dr Bronner's is a treat to the pallet. There's no match for the taste of Dr. Bronner's. I consume a lot in my food preps. and straight out of the jar on a butter knife blade. So, when it's time to enjoy the delicious Dr. Bronner's flavor, preparing popcorn for example, I use the Doc.. When in other food preparations, I use the Costco. I've cut my monthly bill in half.........good luck........b

Have been using this oil for seven years. Love it for stir fries and deep frying. Also use on wooden cutting boards and spoons.

The absolute best and only multi use product for my family. Used for cooking, skin moisturizing and hair grooming. Keep in your fridge until ready to use and it'll soften in your hands. Already purchased this coconut oil 4x and I'll continue buying this here on Amazon!

I actually use this as a skin moisturizer.  It’s smells wonderful! Aside from using it on my skin I occasionally add a tiny bit to my hair to prevent dryness. I have purchased this before for myself and have given it as a gift a few times.

This Product is Excellent. You can use it to cook and to moisturize your’e skin.  I’ve been using this product over 5 years.  You will not be disappointedIt’s wonderful.  I give it a A+.

This brand is the best tasting coconut oil I have tried.  I bought a different brand at Sam's Club and it tasted like motor oil!  There really is a huge difference between brands.  Dr. Bronner's coconut oil is smooth, rich, sweet, creamy and delicious.  So yum.  I have not been eating as much coconut oil since I discovered coconut butter, so I am sure this will last a good long time.  I did find a better price at my local health food store on sale, but you can't beat the convenience of Amazon!

Smells amazing

Best of the best coconut oil

I acquired this per recommendation from a natural chef and self care motivator to improve ones overall oral condition and health. The flavor is like toasted fresh coconut. My mouth feels fresher and moister.

Out of the dozens of coconut oil brands I have purchased Dr. Bronners is by far the best.  It has the smoothest texture, melts easily and tastes great. I use a bit in my coffee every morning. Keeps skin and hair moisturized from the inside.Highly recommend for chronic constipation as well.

The tea is great. I don’t recommend buying it from Amazon. They sent the wrong tea and won’t replace it or let me return it. I have not opened the box of tea.

Doesn’t taste the same as the boxes I get in the grocery store. These have a “burnt plastic” almost gassy after taste.

Customer should not waste hard earned money on this product...Worst sleep ever.Want a FULL REFUND!

I hate mint, and I won't drink or eat anything with it, and this is basically mint tea with some notes of other flavors, rather than tasting like passionflower.

I'm assuming I'm having an individual reaction to the ingredients such as Valerian root, but this tea keeps me awake 🤦‍♀️ No issues with this tea company in general. They are high quality tea for a great price.

Though I do not have smooth good night sleep, I usually sleep around 11:00-11:30 PM.  When I received this product, I was looking forward for a good night sleep.  I use three tea bags and drank them at 7:00 PM.  At 11:00 PM, I was wide awake. It kept me awake until almost 4:00 AM.  Perhaps, this tea gives me the adverse effect.  It made me cannot sleep.  After about 9 hours drinking the tea, I was finally able to sleep.  Perhaps, eventually, the tea's substance effectiveness (keeping me awake) wore off.  And since 4:00 AM was pass my bed time, I finally able to sleep for two hours.  Somehow, my body reacted differently than most people.

I don’t think this is the real Night Night Tea. It tastes different and the box is purple instead of blue.

If I could give this product zero stars I would. I tried this for the first time last night, optimistic it was going to help me sleep better, it had the effect like I drank a pot of caffeinated coffee. I twitched the entire night and this morning almost 12 hours later I still have a horrible taste in my mouth from it and I feel hungover from such poor sleep.  It’s definitely not the product for me to help me sleep better.

Seriously.

did nothing for me :)  I am sorry to say.  I dont even see an 800 number to call to make customer comments.Will not buy this brand again,

Bought this for my teenage son who has special needs which make it difficult for him to sleep.  After we started giving him this tea at bedtime, his teacher told us he was sleepy and falling asleep in school.  After two Google searches, I discovered that this tea contains Valerian.  WebMD says Valerian may cause excitability and insomnia.  The box says it contains "passionflower" and a "proprietary blend" of herbs.  If you have a child with special needs, learn from my mistake.

Not even half a bag!

Granted, I have not tried it yet...however...VERY disappointed on how it arrived!  The box was totally smashed and tea bags were falling out, one even opened and tea leafs were everywhere.  Great presentation!! Really??Let's HOPE they taste better than they looked :(

Disgusting taste. Did not work.

Great tea before bedtime. However, this shipment was poorly packaged in an envelope. The tea box was completely crushed.

I love traditional medicine teas in general this one I just did not like- was just disappointed with flavor

Didn’t help.

This takes like warm pee with a mint aftertaste.

This doesn’t help me sleep at all. In fact, I was more awake after drinking it.

Damage  open box

Flavor changed like it has valarian in it.The last 2 weeks I've been having on and off allergic reaction type symptoms"Breathing issues, racing heart, histamine production..etc..etc"I've even fasted "but allowed tea" for a few days to eliminate possibilities, I was "sure" it couldn't be the tea.Well at first after fasting I was thinking it had to be a external influence but started to realize that I was also having some stomach issues with holding air, acid reflux, stomach cramps..etc .etc along with the others mentioned and it magically disappeared for a few days.Today I was researching some investment strategies, drank some coffee ate some breakfast..etc, feeling pretty good and around noon I make a teaAlmost instantly I could feel a burning like sensation as I drank it but was thinking cause it's hot and all that.Within 20 minute of drinking a half cup I start having breathing issues and the rest againI found that taking ALOT of tums, drinking water and almond milk kind helped in the past so I do the same and it starts to go away.Currently it's getting better as the time passes to get it out of my system.I'm almost positive this tea has changed somewhere down the line.I've taken passionflower and what nots plenty of times as a naturopath person and never had this reaction.It tastes pretty bad now also.So I don't know if they accidentally added valarian, or if received a contaminated crop?Just don't do what I do and drink it fast, and feel it out to see you're reaction.

It has an unpleasant sweet taste

I used it to help me get tired at night but unfortunately it did not work for me

I bought this specifically to help me get a better nights sleep throughout the night.  I wear a fitbit watch; so I can honestly say there was zero difference in my sleep pattern when I drank this tea before bed.  I tried difference variations of drinking an hour before bed, 10 minutes before, etc....didn't matter. My sleep was still horrible.  The taste was good; but not worth the money.

My item was delivered in a smash box with one of the teabags busted and all the dust was all over the rest of the products so how to throw  One out and put the rest in a plastic baggie due to the box was destroyed.

Well, if it worked for me, I'd give it a five-star rating, so....

The tea taste good but it didn't help me sleep....in fact it makes you frequently have to urinate. Don't waste your money.

Taste is horrible, at least for me. Didn't help with sleep at all. Positive is the box and bags came intact. Might work for others. Everyone is different.

The flavor tastes like weeds or dirt. It does work however I prefer a more pleasant flavor for my palate

The flavor was nice but the tea unfortunately didn’t work for me

This didn’t work for me and the flavor was just ok. I wouldn’t purchase again

I wanted to try this as I heard so many good things about this tea. I was excited when I got it. But unfortunately I did not like the taste.

It is not as effective as other sleepytime teas.

This did not help me fall asleep but did have a subtle calming effect.

It has a nice taste but it didn’t help me sleep.

Didn't do anything fo me, and I didn't like the taste.  But if you like the herbal tea stuff, you might like this.  Seems otherwise to be a quality product.

I was hoping that with this tea, I could get away from taking Ambien nightly. Maybe I'm just a difficult case.  I don't know.  A friend of mine recommended this highly as aiding her sleep. It simply didn't work for me.  I don't know if it's fair to downgrade my rating on this basis, but I wouldn't want to create the impression that the product worked.

Taste is pleasant.  Relaxes me and helps me fall asleep.  I'm waking up after 5 hours of sleep and cannot go back to sleep. I was hoping the tea would help with this issue but it's not.

I feel terrible the next morning from this product. Super groggy every time I take it.

Shipment came in small bag. The box of tea was crushed. Tea bags do not appear to be damaged.

Maybe this is best for people who don’t take medication to help them sleep at night. This is for people who don’t take anything sedating that is prescribed. I noticed no difference in anxiety or sleepiness. Taste is what you’d expect from herbal tea.

I got this because I have problems getting to sleep and from all the reviews it seemed like this tea would take care of it but alas it was not so.  There is nothing wrong with the tea itself it just did nothing to help me sleep that is why the 3 stars other than that it would of been a 4 or 5 star because it smells ok and tastes decent for a herbal.

Steeped it for about 10 minutes with no darkening of the water.  The flavor is the lightest I have ever tasted.Disappointed as I love this brand.  Their teas are normally very flavourful

It’s ok

The tea is fine. But came in the envelope,  so the box got smashed. Poor packaging.

Product as to be expected. Poor packaging- the box was extremely smashed and tea bags out of box.

Product is what it is but product came NOT sealed which was bothersome..

Good flavor

Ok tea

Excellent. Except for the taste, it's a little strong.

Won't knock you out..... But ..... It will relax 😌 you.

I usually don’t use anything to help me to fall asleep but lately I was having a very difficult time falling asleep, so I decided to give it a try, well so far it works. I am able to sleep in about 10 after started drinking it.

Tea is amazing. But the shipping of this product was way below satisfactory! They shipped this product in a padded envelope! Needless to say the tea box was totally destroyed! Tea it self was ok to use.

Didn't help me sleep like i expected

I did not appreciate that the box that I received was broken, but for sure the tea must be good,it have good ingredients

Takes a little getting used to, but it does seem to help my mind and body relax. It does upset my tummy a bit, though.

This herbal tea is very helpful on those nights when insomnia is knocking at my door. It has a pleasant scent and flavor, not sweet but calming.

The tea relaxed me but really didn't help me sleep.

helps calm anxiety and enable you a good night sleep .

I had unpleasant dreams

Good

A great product.

sleepy tea is tasty, the color is too light, takes too long to get color

I love the calming  effect ,since I started using it I've been able to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep. love the taste  😋 best quality tea.

I am currently recovering from an accident and when I came back home from acute rehabilitation I was struggling sleeping, I would would stay awake all night trying to get comfortable. Due to lack of sleep I got other health issues and a friend recommended this tea. I drink one every night before going to bed and it does relax me and I can get better sleep. Easy to use and it doesn’t taste bad. You can add honey but I drink it by itself.

Love it

I use this tea to help relax me for sleep. Tastes good too. I recommend this herbal tea

It works for me!!

This is great to drink right before bed. It's relaxing.

I love my tea and drink it nightly before bed. Can’t go without it.

I have tried both Sleepytime Extra and Unisom. Neither has been working for me. It’s been very hard for me to sleep lately with work and relationship issues but I drank this tea last night and it is the most calm and restful I’ve felt in a really long time. Grateful for whoever came up with this.

I love the balance of the mellow flavorful herbs in this tea.

This tea really is a great relax and fall asleep tea ..it workes for me . My new relax drink !!

Great taste and fully soaks unlike others that don’t turn the water a tea color.

I found this product helped me to relax and fall asleep.  It has a nice flav9r and definitely lives u0 to its purpose

Tastes great and drift me off to sleep peacefully.

So soothing and relaxing. I love drinking this team to help me sleep instead of taking melatonin.

Love it!

Loved the tea. Really relaxed me.  Really  good.the best I’ve ever drank. Sleep So well!

This tea is exactly what I was hoping for. I enjoy the flavors of spearmint and lemon verbena and it was very relaxing. I recommend this’

Several family members and I all swear by this tea as an aid to sleep. I think it tastes great but I do use honey in my tea, can’t speak for how it tastes without honey…

Great sleep aid.  doens't knock you out but helps you drift off

Excellent service, quality product. Thanks.

Tea is soothing before bedtime relaxing and puts me to sleep

This was recommended to me by an acupuncturist. It works well and tastes fine, rather mild. Occasionally I add a sweetener and some lemon. But most importantly it helps me fall asleep and go back to sleep quickly when I wake up in the middle of the night. Plus it’s organic. This variation is Much Better tasting and smelling. Than Nighty Night Extra.

The product works for me. I can feel relaxed after drinking.

Not only delicious but works! Improved my sleep..reduced water retention..feel calmer..will definitely reorder!

I been having difficulty sleeping , and staying asleep. I been drinking this tea, and I been sleeping through out the whole night. It’s great value , and taste pretty good.

Very effective as a sleep aid. Slight grogginess the following day.

I enjoyed the tea. Was outta my sleep gummies and by golly, the tea did the trick🫡💜

Sipping this tea before bed, along with turning all electronics off and reading a few pages of a novel, has improved my sleep. I’ve been able to fall asleep faster and sleep longer.

I am going through a hard season and this PUTS ME TO BED. It’s a lovely hour before bedtime habit  - I’m on my second box :)

I have a hard time falling and staying asleep at night. Usually my mind wont slow down. For the past few weeks I have been drinking this tea in the evening about an hour before I goto bed and it works!  Highly recommend!!

I didn’t have any expectations for this tea- I just thought it was chamomile, tbh, I don’t really have sleep problems. I just fixed myself a cup for something to have one night. And BAM, I slept like somebody hit me on the head with a 2x4. My husband even made fun of me for sleeping so hard that I was all wonky in the bed, like I just fell into it. I have had it several nights now with the same result. I wake up very refreshed. The only odd thing I notice is that I have either more vivid or more memorable dreams, but not nightmares. I would definitely recommend it, and am ordering a box for my insomniac parents.

worked ok i drink afew cups before bed it is also cheaper on here than my local store.

Nice flavor

I wake up during night& stay up. I drink this,appears to help. Nice flavor,good price.

I loved it all.

I have a cup of this before bed and it really helps me to go to sleep!

Good

Whenever I have stress, I would drink a cup of this tea before I go to bed. I noticed a great difference on the sleep quality from this tea. I also recommended it to a friend who has trouble sleeping at night and he said it does help with his sleep. The only thing I don't like much is the smell of it but it's tolerable.

As described by seller. I recommend it.

I don’t usually write reviews, but I love this tea so much. The flavor is unmatched, and my favorite is that this night time tea has the mint as well. I always get bad headaches at night so having a night time tea with the spearmint leaf as well is a huge bonus and helps my head a lot. I have had the best sleep since I started using this tea. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

I drink this tea about an hour before I get into bed.  I've noticed that I'm more relaxed and ready to sleep than I had been before I began drinking Nighty Night tea.  Perhaps it's my imagination, however, I do think my sleep is more restful and I'm waking more refreshed.In addition, I like the taste.  I've tried other nighttime teas. This is my favorite.

good taste and works

I forgot how helpful this tea is, helps me relax if I drink in hour before going to bed. Add a teaspoon of good honey. Works for me.Restful Dreams

Nighty night

Good tea. Wish they made more sizes. Works to get you to drift off to sleep, or calm you at work. Drink it all day to be a mellow person.

Box arrived smashed and sticky. Product unusable and now I’m finding out that the item is “not returnable”.

would not buy again

Very stinky tea that my bf told me not to drink and made my lady parts taste weird

Woke me up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. Trash.

Did not taste good as other have described. It tasted like dirty water and smelled like oregano. Worst tea I've ever tasted...

This box of tea came squished and ripped. As if it had been ripped open or someone drove over it. I taped it back together, so I don't have a photo the original condition it was in. The tea is fine, but it was pretty smashed upon arriveal.

This tea doesn’t help you sleep but it tastes okay. I would not recommend it and would not buy it again.

Tastes okay. Doesn't really work but that's probably because I lose most of the tea in every single bag. What is the point if a teabag if literally NONE of them are sealed? Every single tea bag is just "open" on the inside and the tea is lost. Won't buy again.

Did not work very well for me.

It’s yucky. And sticky.

Not saying it's bad, but there's something weird about it that kept me up trying to figure out what it is....which defeats the purpose of a sleepy tea, entirely.I'll stick with Herbal Essences sleepytime detox

Love this blend

This is a nice light tea, perfect for drinking before bedtime.  Unfortunately, it was shipped to me in a bubble envelope.  The envelope was intact, but the box was crushed.  I should be able to save most of the teabags, but I sure can’t give it as a gift!  Hopefully, I can find it locally ( or buy it from someone who will ship it in a box).

An ok tasting tea, just not helping me much. I will keep trying.

It’s a great product - fresh and flavorful soothing tea. But when it came, the box was completely bent and ripped and the teabags were scattered.

would have wanted it to be a bit stronger, even if before bed

Depending on the brand and the amount of valerian in the mix, some of the nighttime teas taste pretty bad.  This strikes a good balance; it seems to have enough of everything so that it works well as a sleepy time tea, and it also tastes quite nice.  It’s now my go-to.

Helps me sleep

Delicious tea! The package arrived crushed, but the teabags were fine.

Smells awesome, the valerian root is pretty strong so it’ll relax the heck outta you. I was having a hard time sleeping for a while and my therapist recommended valerian root as an alternative to OTC drugs. Let’s just say, VALERIAN ROOT DONT PLAY NO GAMES. it’ll knock you out (in a most blissful slumber way)

It has no scent to it, the taste is mild and sweet almost like chamomile.I grab two packs per serving at night time and I sleep like a baby!Completely recommend

Makes me drowsy every time. And taste great. A win win 🏆

I have fibromyalgia which brings sleep issues. If I forget to drink this tea I have trouble falling asleep. I have recommended this tea to others and they agree it has made a positive impact on improving sleep.

Seems to promote falling asleep and staying asleep. Like that it is all natural.

Absolutely love this tea. Not a huge fan of tea packets but these ones are for sure eco friendly and organic so win win! The flavor is delish

Pukka is one of my favorite brands. I'm never disappointed.

Flavor is pretty good.

Sweet bloom on tongue

This is my favorite flavor by this brand, though the package was crushed when I got it.

I love all Pukka teas

Great product!

Amazing taste, quality tea. It's cheaper at the grocery if they carry it where you are. If not, still worth ordering

Love the taste.

Best nighttime tea I've ever come across.

I was sceptic but my daughter bought me a box to try , I’m so thankful the blend is one of the best relaxing teas I ever had .I’d recommend this to anyone for sleep, relaxation and anxiety , it tastes great with hints of the licorice to give it a sweet snap no worries on tasting or smelling valerian kudos to puka .I have used all ingredients separately though the combination is the magic bullet .A loyal customer for ever .

I bought this to put in a gift basket for a friend who says that she struggles to sleep at night. Though I'm not sure how she likes it, she got excited and definitely seemed to appreciate it when she saw it . Now, since reading the ingredients before purchasing it, it's time for me to get some for myself. Will try to remember to update my review once I've given it a try.

Taste delicious, and smells great!

Had to get it for my friend; it's her favorite.

You can literally give me a horse tranquilizer and I can't sleep lol, this tea knocked me out! Made me so relaxed and sleepy so I stocked up! Love it

horrible taste, do not believe this was fresh three mint, no mint taste

It seems like the ONLY fresh and minty tasting tea I have purchase so far is the MINA organic Nana Moroccan tea. Every other has been great disappointment.

This order was not complete - I only received one box when the order was for three boxes of tea.

I only received one out of three Pukka three mint orders.

For having 3 mints disappointed. No flavor. No fragrance.

Didn't like it

I was hoping to buy some tea with Great rich flavor, like their page said.  This had none of this and was probably the most bland tea I have ever tried.  "Made with organic peppermint, spearmint and fieldmint."So what is Fieldmint anyway?  Never heard of it.This is a fake description and product in my opinion:* Good news for refreshing the palate* Made with organic peppermint, spearmint and fieldmint* Three types of mint for a vibrant cool and Supreme sweetnessI DO NOT RECOMMEND!

This tea tastes good.  It's too bad you'll only be able to drink tea from half of them.  As soon as you add water the bags open up and leaves go everywhere.  I will not be buying this brand again.

If you love this actual tea and the brand, go for it. I was expecting more of a peppermint - strong mint flavor being that it has 3 different mints... but its more of a herbey mint flavor. grass...pass. Not here I am stuck with all these teas...

There’s no flavor to this tea

I haven't had any tea as I may need to return this package that was not as advertised.

NOT a 6 pack!

The tea has a weak taste. Not happy with it. I won't buy again.

I normally take Moroccan mint teas. I ran out on my normal batch so I ordered this for a try. This is very mild tea. If you are looking for that coolness on your throat from the tea, this is not it. Very very mild. I mean it is fresh, but very mild. I will probably finish this pack but I wouldn't buy a send one. I'll go back to my Moroccan mint. I like to stong minty frangrance on my tea and that coolness that mint tea gives you when you drinking it. A bit disappointed.

This item was shipped in an Amazon bubble envelope allowing the box to be crushed and torn. The tea is still usable. This was planned for a Christmas Day treat. The tea bags are still sealed but the box doesn’t look presentable. NBD but if the tea was damaged be aware there’s no returns. Gave middle ratings for flavor and warmth. I haven’t tried it but am required to rate it.

Gave this a try but the flavor was super light I put the tea Bags and barely any flavor mainly water it didn’t have a strong flavor.. I like more flavor in my tea.

Need a lot of imagination to find a taste of mint.

It is not a strong mint flavor, and it is best served cold. I probably won't repurchase it.

I expect a stronger taste for the goodness of 3 kinds of mints.  Disappointed!

It's a great product with a great taste, but unfortunately the Best before date is a week ahead of the receiving date.

Okay, but very light and had to seep a long time.

It took about 2 cups of tea to get used to the taste but then I enjoyed it and appreciate the quality of the tea

Fresh n tasty.

Good stuff, but it’s definitely one that can take a longer steeping time. The package arrived smashed in a torn plastic mailer bag, but the tea itself was undamaged.

Great tea ! I love it!

I always made old fashioned red rose tea with mint added.I now indulge in Iced Lemongrass,Green with perhaps 2 to 3 of these 3 mint teabags.A bit of citrus (Lemon or Lime)The Best for those hot summer days.

I love mint tea and drink about a cup or 2 daily. It's extremely good with honey and some crystallized ginger. Sometimes almond milk and a dash of cinnamon

My favorite tea. Helps settle my stomach and is delicious. I wish it was less expensive.  But my favorite mint tea.

Popular among your local supermarket all over the UK. Missed them so much after moving back to the US, and I can’t find them anywhere except for Amazon.

I bought this for my son, who loves green teas and mint teas.It was robust but not overwhelming, but the right amount of mintiness.He and both love to put a bag with a bag of gree in a large travel mug- great flavor, and a touch of caffeine.It's a wonderful product.

I had been buying 3 Mint aqt a local store. That store closed.  Other loca vendors have Puka, but not 3 Mint.  So I turned to Amazon.

My daughter loves mint tea. I’ve bought Tazo, Traditional Medicinals, Yogi, and a few other brands I can’t remember, but this one is her favorite.

This tea is getting harder and harder to find in stores. So glad I found it here at a decent price!

If you like mint tea - then this is definitely for you. I find the flavor of the three mints calming especially if I’m stressed or have nausea. It’s a great go-to to have in your cupboard for anyone who likes tea or for health purposes. I’ve been drinking it for a while, so as a repeat buyer of this flavor, and brand, I highly recommend trying it. It’s good hot or cold.

Such an intense mint tastes.  Love it, my favorite tea ever!!!

Trusted brand, great value. Very good

the best herbal tea for calming my digestive issues

Love that mint tea.  Great taste and great value for your money

Great flavour

I try various teas and often get tired of them, but this one has stood the test of time. One of my favorites.

I have sent this tea to loved ones and it has become a favorite. I love the quantity and value for the price.

Tasty and calming before as it has no caffeine. Also works well to settle your stomach.

I tried many mint teas and this one is by far my favorite. I highly recommend drinking it with a splash of oatmilk!

Delicious mint herb tea. I was worried about it being too weak or taking too long to brew from some reviews, but nope, brews fully in less than 2 minute. Also it tastes very fresh and naturally minty - no hint of any chemical, stale, or other off flavor which I pick up in so many purported herbal teas.

Was dubious about effectiveness for nausea...but it works !!!  Flavor is far superior to other brands of Peppermint teas.

My flavor

I recently read mint can help reduce inflammation, joint pain, and acne.  It is working for me and the taste of this tea is minty and rich.  It’s the best mint decaffeinated tea I’ve tried.  I’m also a fan of the tazo zen mint green tea, if I want something caffeinated.  This tea is slightly more expensive, but very reasonable considering it’s fairtrade and the packaging is environmentally friendly.  Will continue to purchase.

We drink this tea at night when it’s cold out. We absolutely love it. I’m a huge fan of the tea bags as well, please keep in mind that not all companies use - non plastic tea bags. Plastic tea bags are Not good for your health. Stay safe everyone

Nothing more to add, for me it's the best blend of different mint teas that I could find in the US.

Refreshing iced and soothing hot.

Love it, the mint is well balanced and the flavor isn't intense. Works great for stress and upset stomach. Was also carefully packaged so none of the boxes were damaged.

This is such a nice tea and while we love it because of the flavor, my friend is Persian and says it is good for stomach upset with nabat.

I love this mild, gentle mint tea. It soothes my stomach and refreshes when I drink in addition to just being delicious!

Personally I’m a huge tea fan. Like that this one is non-caffeinated and offers 3 different flavors within one bag. You can definitely taste all the flavors. Perfect choice for a warm and healthy nightcap.

It's very smooth and has a Great taste. My favorite mint tea. It's hard to find in the store.

I love all tea,  this was super delicious. Very nice flavor, smooth.  I am a honey lover, but don't need it with this item.

Mix it with chocolate rooibos and it will take like peppermint barks.

Best mint taste I ever had

Love the taste. Very refreshing.

Great flavor blend. I will be purchasing this again. I would very much recommend this product.

Great for stress, relaxation, and soothes the mind, stomach, and the soul. This tea brings peace.

Nice tasting mint tea. Not overly minty. More gentle taste and smell.Great brand of teas...

I haven't had a Pukka that I didn't like, but this one is extra delicious!!

I drink this every night before bed. It settles my stomach and lets me unwind. If I don't drink it, I am a wreck the next day

Tasty tea with a well balanced blend of mints. Soothing for a sore throat

The blend of flavors is really tasty.

Nice packaging, good flavor but I expected more

This tea has a lovely scent and wonderful flavor!

The best tasting and highest quality of all of the mint teas that I have tried.

I love this tea

Best pukka peppermint tea! Great price in bulk!

Love this tea. Again , and again new customer.

Really nice mint tea!!

I thought this tea sounded delicious. It ended up being so bitter...so disappointing

Is this deceptive advertising?  I received one stinking box when there are supposed to be a pack of SIX  boxes.  I am complaining and returning.

Love this tea but for some reason not as good as from the store...when I received my package it smelled heavily of taco seasoning. Don't get me wrong, I'm no lunatic, I love tacos, I even buy my taco seasoning via subscribe & save from Amazon, but this is a review for chamomile tea, a far cry from tacos, I think. Anyway, I curiously opened the envelope and took a deep whiff of the 6 boxes of tea I'd just purchased -- yep, tacos. "Taco tea?" I asked myself? I dunno...maybe it was just shipped with some strong stuff....I decided to chance it 'cause I really like this tea. Well, you'll never believe it, it's actually quite a bit bland compared to what I'd been used to from the store. Takes two bags to get it where I like and still cheaper, but at least it doesn't taste like tacos.

This did not taste like chamomile, vanilla, or manuka honey to me, as the licorice flavor was overpowering. I ended up giving it away to someone who does like licorice, so I can't attest to how well it works sleep-wise.

I was expecting a bit more flavor with this particular brand.  It was more of essence of than actual taste. I am hoping it is not the same with the other herb flavors I ordered

My favorite tea to help with sleep. Having difficulty finding it elsewhere, this is quite overpriced.

Great product but- it arrived in a large soft sided envelope and was crushed so bad the box couldn't be used, had to put them in a zip lock. l

This was a gift.  The box was totally crushed, very disappointing.

It’s got a mild flavor but an unpleasant licorice smell

This is my favorite night time tea - a cup is relaxing and calming at the end of the day. The flavor is great, with a touch of sweetness so no additional sweetener is needed, and I just add a splash of milk to make it perfect. I have gifted this tea to others because I like it so much. It feels like a little bit of a splurge, but is totally worth it to me.

Good tea, nice flavor

I hate tea, but when I have a sore throat or bad cough, this soothes it better than anything else I’ve tried.  Sometimes I add a splash of vanilla cream to it and it tastes like dessert, which is great when you have strep or the flu and all you can eat is toast or broth.

Pukka offers some of the best herbal tea blends I've ever had. I first found them in the UK and I was happy to find they sell here too! They have a large selection of black, green and herbal teas.Chamomile and Vanilla flavors complement each other very well and the subtle taste of Manuka honey makes this a great non caffeinated blend. They were packaged carefully and were delivered without any problems.

At first I didn't like this tea much.  I actually put it away and was going to toss it once I hadn't drank it for a few months.  It was far too licorice-y for my taste and not enough of any of the other flavors so I was disappointed.A few weeks later, I was looking for something different from my current selection and saw this one again.  I thought, let me give it another try.  So I did... and I love this tea.  I'll tell you what I did wrong.  The back of the pack says to steep up to 15 mins.  I normally steep most of my herbal teas for 5-8 minutes so I took 15 mins as a suggestion.  It is NOT a suggestion.  If you like licorice tea, steep it for 5 mins.  If you want the actual flavor of the tea with chamomile, vanilla and honey and barely any licorice, steep it no less than 10 mins.  10-15 is best.  I promise, if you like the flavors mentioned in the name of the tea, you will love this tea if you just steep it long enough.

Great tea - love the flavor!  While the packaging is pretty, I wish they would put it in a smaller container. Save the planet on cardboard as the box is not full. And lower the price. But all that said, I keep buying it because it is so good.

Like the flavor it’s a good tea!

Pricey but exactly what I wanted. I received a sample in the mail and loved it but getting more has proved challenging. I found it on Amazon but it's a bit expensive. The flavor is fantastic for someone like me that is picky about tea. It's very relaxing before bed.

Delicious, and soothing!

With having use of a coupon it was a great buy. Make sure you follow the directions on the package because it makes a difference in the flavor

chamomile + vanilla + manuka honey = perfection, especially since it's all organic. thank you to pukka for creating this tea!

This is a very warm cozy tasting treat before bed. My ritual in the evenings always includes this tea.

This is my favorite chamomile tea. It has a lovely soothing flavor, smoother than more flowery tasting chamomile teas.

I discovered Pukka Herbal teas and I Love them. This is one of my favorites

My favorite night time tea. Delicious and calming

Great tea

One of my favorite, chamomiles, along with Taylors and Wissotzsky.

This is the best chamomile tea! The vanilla and honey flavors come through. I love giving this one as an add on for gifts for Mother's Day, teachers, etc. Everyone loves this tea and wants to know where I get it. I've only found it at amazon and central market. I might start buying in bulk to stock my gift closet...

Lovely flavour

false advertising nothing special

Worst tea I’ve had..

Okay but expensive

I did not like the taste.

I was not expecting one of the main ingredients to be black licorice. Nasty stuff🤢

Ok

I know these two herbs are very good for one's immune system, but I cannot get past the horrible taste.  In the garbage, ugh!

The Pukka Elderberry/Echinacea tea is sweet. If you like a sweeter herbal tea, this may be for you.  My personal preference is for a stronger fruity flavor. The elderberry flavor is not dominant, much to my dismay

I actually like the taste. I added a little honey and some fresh lemon. However, I think this tea made my tummy hurt. Maybe I just have to get used to it? Not sure yet. I’ll update this once I try more of this product.

I only purchased this tea due to Covid 19 and to build my immune system. The tea itself doesnt tastes the best in my opinion. Its sort’ve grassy/woodsy flavored.

The taste is different

So I will drink it because echinacea is good for you, but the flavor is just tolerable, not delicious.

Once I got the replacement from the wind blowing the first one off, it was excellent.

Bought other Pukka teas. this one's flavour is a bit too subtle. It's still fine but not my fave.

The flavor is delicious. Super yummy taste.

Great taste

Very good brand, flavorful

The original stuff is soft, sweet and incredibly biologically friendly, even for me. I am starting to see it disappear though. I don't know if it's a supply issue, or they're getting rid of it or something, but it's incredibly frustrating. There aren't a lot of teas I can drink, and many of them I can't drink for long before my body throws a fit. They are now bringing into circulation something with 'Wellness Support' in the title and it's awful. The taste is so overwhelming that I feel like my head gets overheated and muzzy and my stomach doesn't like me very much. The boxes are similar so watch out!!!

My favorite tea to have with honey before bed. Tastes great, feels calming and helps my digestive.

This flavor is good

The only complaint I have about this tea is the fact that it took 2 months to get it. Well I guess if we get sick again we'll have it in advance.....

I really like this product and the variety of flavors.  I often give the variety package as a gift.

Delicious tea, just add water and honey

This Tea makes me mellow and calm ! It's great before bed!

This tea is what my household drinks when we need a boost or when we are sick. It has a great flavor and helps the body really well

Very strong but delicious got really bad covid and it was just what I needed and very strong for my messed up tastebuds

This help me get knock out my cold w/in a few days of drinking daily. The flavor is okay with honey. I also feel like Amazon overcharge for some of the products

Loved this tea....I put a fairy-free creamer with it with it and it felt very comforting. I loved the almost fruity, earthy flavor of it...will order again.

This is the greatest tea has a wonderful flavor

Tea bags damaged grains all coming out

My husband loves to drink this before work.

I love the tea

This tea is more like a dessert! So tasty and feels good in my system...

It was so good but when stewing it had a funny smell kind of like plastic

Flavorful

I love this tea, especially if you feel a cold coming on.  Its very comforting.

Unfortunately, before I bought this, I did not do my research. Google: Using yerba mate long-term, especially with alcohol or nicotine, has been linked to an increased risk of various types of cancer, including stomach, kidney, lung, and mouth cancer. Don't confuse yerba mate with caffeine or other caffeine sources, such as green tea, black tea, and guarana. WASTE OF MONEY CAN'T RETURN.

It was delivered inside a mailing envelope that was in perfect condition and another tea package also in perfect condition, therefore it was already broken when it was placed in the mailing envelope.

product arrived ripped open and not usable. Might as well burn your money instead of buy this. Was so looking forward to trying this product as I thought it would come in an intact safe product to use, but recieved a ripped open bag that I cannot safely use, nor return or request a replacement. I want a replacement 😩 bummed it came damaged! Do not buy!

I’ve had this tea before from Whole Foods and it’s very good.But, I would be careful ordering it because the packaging is sooo light it will easily rip. Literally, it’s so fragile that just pulling on it a bit will cause it to tear. Mine came ripped and it probably happened from the driver simply handling it. They need to spend a little more money and make secure packaging.

The package came opened and is not eligible for replacement.

extremely weak , not what I expected. I would not buy it again

Years ago they used to be my favorite brand of yerba mate and I don’t know what happened if they just don’t have enough people Buying from them to get rid of their inventory, but I bought three bags and they are so stale and dry. It’s like they’ve been sitting in storage for years so I’m very disappointed. I can pour literally boiling boiling water on them and steep them for 10 minutes, and I still barely get a taste of the maté

I am always hesitant on ordering this tea because while it is a great product, the way it is packaged and shipped is always dicey and I don't know whether or not I will get a sealed product or messed up packaging. This time, I went with a different buyer and while the correct measure was taken to seal the package in an airtight wrapping was taken, either the person/robot sealing it ran out of plastic wrap or it was ripped haphazardly before shipping 😒

I would not recommend this to any one with a weak stomach.  These are hell on the stomach. I just wasted my money since Amazon will not take them back.

No complaints.  It's excellent any time of day.

I Iove this company who hasn’t sold its soul to cooperate greed. Keep it up! Great yours and tasting room if you ever visit Sebastopol Ca.

First time I tried this I felt the effects for 3 days.  Might be my biology, but this stuff gives me a huge hit, totally not like coffee.  It did disrupt my sleep a bit, but the energy and focus were worth it.  I drink it now every few days, can't do every day.

This is my first time using this and I love it. I was afraid I wouldn’t like the taste but it’s not bad at all. I use this  everyday n will continue drinking this daily.

Excellent tasting tea. It arrived quickly and is in a sealable bag. Will definitely buy again.

Really love this tea- alot in the package- nice light taste and definitely suppressed appetite in the evenings. It's a winner.

Good quality tea.

Will buy again!

My husband drink tea everyday at work.

always good gentle pick me up

I like the taste and the healthy benefits of yerba mate tea.

Tried this brand and was pleasantly surprised about the smooth flavor. Great Green Tea!

Came individually wrapped in a sealed bag.  I like the taste and convenience of it

This product is great. I do notice that I have more energy when I drink it.

This large pack of tea was a good deal.  I like the health benefits and the energy boost from this tea.

This right here is literally liquid smoke to me and felt amazing for non smoker. I felt energized keeps me going and focus through the day. Overall satisfied and amazed as yerba mate drinker.

One bag makes several cups. Good taste, just enough caffeine

Great tea, I feel the effects.

This is just what we were looking for. Has a nice kick but doesn't give you the gut ache that coffee can

Arrived quickly. Very satisfied

I really like the taste of this product

The bags are well packed, fresh and tasty

I love this tea

great taste. great energy. great smell. LOVE THIS TEA

Better vibe than coffee with more antioxidants

Good stuff

This gives me great energy and mood enhancement to start my day. I have chronic illness and fatigue and this has made a difference in my mornings.

This is my hubby’s favorite tea.  Always have it on hand.

Love this tea

I've drank this for years now, love it

We use this product almost daily.

Good tea, I have a cup every morning with some raw unfiltered honey

Every single day I look forward to waking up and taking my first sip of yerba mate, specifically the mint flavor. Absolutely the best 11/10 I love it so much. I can safely say this drink brings me JOY ❤️

Healthy alternative to drinks out there.

A friend gave me this same tea as a gift and I loved it so much I wanted to buy more. I was excited to share with my friends. However, the tea I received, which shipped from EU, barely has any aroma when you open the single wrapped tea bags and virtually no flavor when brewed. I opened two of the boxes- same problem.  The box is stamped with origin, dates etc that all seem good, but there's a quality problem somewhere in the supply chain. The item is not eligible for refund.

This tea used to be awesome. After loving the first batch I ordered, which had a very predominant rose flavor, I ordered a 3-pack of the same tea and it tastes completely different! This time, only the chamomile comes through, and honestly just I’m not a big fan of chamomile. The very reason I ordered this tea was for its rose flavor that originally far outshined the chamomile. Makes me wonder if the company behind this brand has adjusted its formulations or raw material sourcing to reduce costs, like so many companies do when they grow. I want to love this brand, but I’m very disappointed by this discovery and regret my purchase. Probably will not explore the other Pukka varieties as I’d intended to do.

Very weak herbal flower tea.

This tea caused a bad reaction in my throat. Throat was itchy, hoarse & I could not talk. I thought I was getting covid. But after drinking this tea twice & then stopping, I realized it was the tea. Had to throw away the 3 boxes I purchased. Waste of money. Such a shame, I usually love Pukka teas which is why I bought 3 boxes without trying it first. Won't be doing that again 👎

This was supposed to be 3 packs of 20 tea bags. I only received 1 pack of 20 tea bags. When I tried to do a refund request the request would not go through. I filled out all fields but when I clicked on the continue button, nothing happened. I just want either the 2 missing packs of tea or a refund on the 2 missing packs of tea.

I used three bags and steeped them a long time. Pukka teas are more often than not… weak and tasteless.  I was hoping this would differ and now have three boxes to get through. :-/(I love Big Heart Tea and even Tazo herbal tisanes, which have more body.)

I really wish I would have read the ingredients on this before I purchased three boxes. Very misleading as the box has roses all over it and it's the first ingredient on the front of the box. IT HAS LICORICE IN IT! YUCK! Kind of misleading.

I tried a sample a couple of years ago at a Natural Products convention in Anaheim, CA. It was wonderful! I finally bought the Puka Love and I’m so disappointed! The teabag has no aroma. I steeped the tea for 15 minutes as suggested. It only has a faint chamomile flavor. It’s a one note tea. Big bummer!

This is my first time buying this tea. The taste of the tea is very strange, like medicine, I can't swallow it, but because the package has been opened, there is no way to return it, I regret it very much.

I have purchased many Pukka teas.  This is my least favorite.  It is largely flavorless and I have to use three tea bags at a time.  It was not returnable.  I love all the other products this company makes.

I bought a three pack and received one box that has been crushed open. Extremely unhappy with my order.Edit: I ordered a replacement and once again received only One Box. I added the second picture as proof of this as well. I'm amazed it wasn't crushed in this mailer.

Only received one box of tea NOT the 3 boxes advertised. Amazon tried to replace it, and once again only sent me one box of tea. So now I've paid for 3 boxes and have only received 2. Amazon won't give me a refund since they already "replaced" the first mishap.

The product advertisers as a 3 pack of 20. I received only a single 20 packUpdate: requested a replacement as I was shorted 2 boxes. I received one additional box and am not permitted further action. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!

I did receive all 3 boxes. Saw some reviews saying otherwise.Pretty packaging, but did not like the flavor of the tea. Tasted bitter and expired.Will not buy again.

The product is great!!!! Seller however ONLY delivers ONE product instead of the the THREE that is described. I tried having the problem resolved and the product resent and again only ONE box as shipped! This is a total rip off!!!!!

I can taste a bit of chamomile, but that's about it. No color, no taste. Very disappointed.

This showed up with a messed up box and yes ONE box of tea-Not 3 like it says. Do not buy from here.The tea itself is great, one of my favorites.

I did not receive the 3 boxes of tea that I was suppose to. I only received one.

I love this tea. It is delicious, soothing and great to drink before going to bed.I purchased a 3 count pack and I ONLY RECEIVED ONE PACK!!!!!! Where are my other 40 sachets!!!!!

I love this tea but was charged $15 for one box!!!!!!? Not right I've ordered this before and think my order was mixed up??

Pukka Love, Organic Herbal Tea With Chamomile & Lime Flower (3 Pack, 60 Tea Bags)  ONLY RECEIVED ONE  NOT THREE

Only received one pack. Should've looked at the reviews before buying. But delicious.

Only received one box. Not three as is shows on the description and photos

THis is advertised as a 3-pak and I was sent 1 box of tea.

I bought this 3 box pack but one 1 box came.

The taste was like old shoes boiled and the smell was wet dog.  Trashed.

I only received one pack. It was supposed to be three.

The description says 3 boxes and I only received one

Barely you taste the flavor, takes so long to see the taste and color in the hot water

Received the wrong one!! Not happy

Very weak taste.

From the pretty pink cover, you'd think there was a nice flowery, rosy, maybe even a berry tea. It's mostly chamomile.  And very weak flavor.  Like drinking chamomile water.  I wanted to love it but don't.

The tea is great, it's one of my favourites. But this listing is a scam! The image makes it look like three boxes but you only get one, which makes this ridiculously expensive. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.

misleading photo of 3 boxes, messaged amazon but nth changed.just avoid

SCAM!!! The photo shows 3 boxes. Only 1 box is delivered

First off, I want to say. I adore this tea. I have boughten Pukka tea multiple times and my favorite is the Love Tea. Highly aromatic and tastes wonderful.That being said, the last 5 orders I’ve ordered have been missing 90% of the order. I am only shipped one item out of a multipack. This is with all my orders not just this tea. In this case, I ordered a multipack of the Love tea (comes with 3 boxes), and I was shipped one. It was shipped with other heavy items I ordered separately and was smashed upon arrival. I have contacted amazon with each order and continue have these problems. If you want to order, be sure to order ahead of time to ensure you have time to complain and get a replacement. In my case even replacements have not been shipped out properly!

Barely flavors the water. Super mild. Can’t pick up on the rose taste. Basically just a watery chamomile tea.

Ordered 3 boxes for 60 tea bags, only received 1 box for 20 total tea bags. Good tea, but dsappointed to not receive my full order amount!

Don't buy on here. It's listed as a 3 pack and I only received one. You're best to go to the store and get off Amazon.

Too mild and rooty for my taste. Now I’m stuck with 3 boxes. Great packaging and message though!

Soooo keep an eye on that especially if you have allergies!

Little bit too bitter tasting to me .

For me I did not care for this as much as other ones from Pukka.  I have the same flavors in other brands that I like better because I enjoy a stronger tea. If you like mild teas this one would be for you

Imo I enjoyed the taste. You taste all of the tea. Tastes decadent with vanilla almond milk added. Great value for the money

I like Pukka Love, rose, chamomile & lavender.  Got it from my daughter before.  Remember how much I liked the tea.  So I found it in Amazon and placed one order of 3 packs at once.  One order of 3 packs was too confuse for the shipping department.  It took 3 times for me to get my completed ONE order, 1 pack each time.

It's very light. The chamomile came across the most to me but that was light too. I did enjoy the Love and will have it again, as well as gifting.

Comforting tea

I usually drink chamomile tea after dinner. This is a good option.

No overpowering taste or smell, just a gentle relaxing experience.

When it comes to tea, I am usually very particular about what I chose to drink and the taste. But I am a huge fan of Pukka brand and the types of teas it makes, which is why I bought Pukka Organic Love herbal tea. I love the chamomile, rose, and lavender combination. The perfect tea to enjoy with my husband and when friends and family visit. Great evening tea to relax and unwind after a long day. Smells amazing and tastes delicious. I highly recommend this particular tea and plan on purchasing more. It's caffeine free and smells incredible! Just place one tea bag in a cup, infuse it for up to 15 minutes and enjoy! Easy to open packaging and steeps well.

It’s hard to critique a tea flavor. This is one of my favorite of all time. Very yummy and relaxing.

Extremely floral with a very nice rose aftertaste.  My favorite tea flavor!

Just sad I have to order it and can't find it in stores anymore

I love taking herbs in the for of teas. Herbs have amazing benefits. I like the flower teas. This one has an enjoyable floral flavor. Yes to this one. Health is wealth.

UPDATE: Changed to 5 stars. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. They sent my missing boxes of tea. They want to know if there is a fulfillment issue.Would be 5 stars, however like so many others, I received ONE 20 count of a pack of THREE. . Please contact me for my order number and ship the other TWO boxes of 20 count. The "LOVE" blend of Chamomile with lavendar and rose tea is delicious.

Love this tea! Great flavor!

This tea is so yummy and relaxing. My daughter said "mom we need to stock up and always have this"

So happy with this tea! Can't say enough!!!

I love this herb tea. It has a hint of sweetness and smells great.

This is a wonderful way to sync your mind and body! Light taste of warming flavors & you don’t have to add any sweetener to it, tastes great by itself, it’s calming and puts everything at ease & its ingredients are wholesome & good. A sensation for the entire You!

This tea is wonderful! Pukka makes great teas and I have no problem with that. The problem is what I got which was one box when I brought a set of three boxes. Please look at your orders when fulfilling them. Amazon your service is usually great, but not so today.

Just came in today and tried it and I love it the combination of flavors are great will definitely be buying more soon Really good value to originally onley whanted one box but glad their was three of them good value to

arrived quickly , great product

My favorite calming herbal tea. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of chamomile but the lavendar and rose give it a lovely taste and aroma. Boxed with the word "Love" prominent it is a cute gift. It's terrific that it is organic but it is kind of spendy. I'm still a fan.

This tea is one of my favorites. It’s sweet, aromatic, not perfume way different,  and the packaging is so pretty. I’ve even given this tea as a gift because I want others to enjoy it as much as I do.

I discovered this tea in NYC back in 2016 and i have been hooked ever since. Now i have my bf, family, and coworkers hooked on it. Their matcha one is excellent too

This herbal tea is the BOMB DIGGITY. It makes a great warm treat with no caffeine.  It has a very subtle sweetness worth noting. I usually sweeten tea to taste but "love" needs no sugar. It can be hard to come by but not on Amazon ;)

I’m so obsessed with this tea. It’s seriously all I drink and I’ve tried a ton of different teas. Extra bonus: I always sleep better after having a cup or two of this.

Sadly I only received one box...I am sure I had ordered a three pack...bummer because I love this tea! 🫖

Love it, albeit Pukka teas are expensive.

Absolutely delicious, gentle flavor.  With a name like, "Love," what's not to like?

The most delicious tea! It has a perfect balance of rose, chamomile and lavender-with a hint of licorice so no sweetener needed. Big fan of this relaxing blend.

I tried this tea at my moms house and fell in love with it. Very floral and lovely. My new favorite

Love this tea!  It has such a nice mellow taste and I feel very relaxed when I drink it!

I love the flavor of this.

It has helped me to relax before going to bed, and I am able to get a better night of sleep.

everything about this tea is wonderful. taste and it is very relaxing

Best relaxing tea around!

It is quite expensive

I like it as something different than my normal high caffeine intake. It was pricier than average, and even higher now. I only buy on sale. $5 a box is my maximum as you only get 20.

makes great ice tea...hard to find in stores...happy Amazon has it...FYI...its an herbal tea level...water should be at a lower temperature in order for it to steep properly.

Great flavor, just leave the bag in for a stronger taste.  My new favorite chamomile tea.  Very soothing.

This tea is perfect for a long stressful day at work! You can taste the chamomile the most over all the other flavors. It is a very relaxing tea and it also helps with inflammation. Just dont drink if you are pregnant or planing on being pregnant because chamomile is well known to cool the reproductive organs and also causes early birth contractions.

Great tea for your lady! She’ll never forget you surprised her. Not easy to find in a retail location without paying way too much.

This tea is so good. It has a light, floral sweet taste. I steep mine for 7 minutes.

So delicous.

Use them for mid morning tea break

Didn't realize I was buying THREE boxes of my tea. Not complaining, so it's not a bad thing! Tea is absolutely delicious, and helps me fall asleep at night.

I usually buy this tea when I’m in London, I’m currently a seafarer & came across it on Amazon.It’s truly one of a kind, I feel so at peace when I drink this tea. I can’t explain the feeling. I’m obsessed with it. In love 😄

Great help to relieve stress...must try

Great Product

I purchased this flavor to try because I like the Triple Ginger version, and I add honey and lemon to that.  Thought why not get one with those two ingredients already added?  This doesn’t taste like it has either honey, lemon or even ginger in it.  The dominant flavor is licorice. I’ve been using it up by using one of the Triple Ginger in a big tea cup at the same time since I can’t waste food.  Will not repurchase.

I should have read the directions before purchasing this tea. I didn’t realize it has such a long steeping time.  Even with steeping at 15 min the flavor is very mild. I do not recommend. It says it has honey but I had to add honey and then lemon and and then ginger. So I realize I could just make this tea without the teabags…while I did read the description a little I expected some fancy teabag but it is just like other tea bags… my fault for being suckered by the flowery words.

Terrible. Smells like mold (everyone around ne agreed) and tastes bad. Arrived out of box because box was smashed, and tea arrived late.

I wish I read the reviews before buying this tea.  It was the second box I bought that was licorice forward.  So I went to the website to see if that was the case with all of their teas; and with the exception of 3 of their teas, all of them have a high licorice root content.  You can smell it as soon as you open the packet.  It's misleading to advertise their teas without putting licorice in the description.  So disappointing.

I bought this assuming it would be a lemon ginger tea, you know, like it says on the package. Brewed the first cup only to find out it tastes a little of ginger and mostly of licorice. Lemon was no where to be found. It's probably a fine tea if you like licorice, but as a  lemon ginger tea it's completely awful.

Taste bad

purchased in store at whole foods for nearly $6 and didn’t take the time to read the label which was a mistake. there’s no honey in this tea, only “honey flavour,” which is a waste of money and false advertising. the flavour profile itself is weak. you’re better off steeping dried ginger with lemon zest and adding honey to it. will never purchase again.

Maybe my taste buds are out of whack, but it was tasteless to me.  Wasn't it supposed to have some honey in it?

I was really excited but I think that I would like for it to be sweeter or it could not be sweet and have more ginger or it could have a more lemon flavor. It is so well balanced in the three flavors that it just tastes like it's lacking. It did help sooth the tickle I had in my throat but I don't think I will buy again.

the herbal teas arrived with the boxes broken half open the sachets all crushed and in two packs Two filters were missing there were 18 instead of 20

Love this tea hot or iced

This tea reminds me of an old medicine bomb recipe for illness. This tea is delicious with great natural flavor and fullness. I would repurchase in a heartbeat.

Great flavor and health benefits in 1!

It’s good but not for me. The honey comes through I just wanted more ginger

Been drinking different teas to get off of sodas. I found this one to have a nice favor. It made me want to order more from this brand. Give it a try and you might just find your new favorite.

If you are not used to ginger teas this might be a good way to try them out. They ginger flavor is not that strong, and the combination tastes great. Add a little honey and you will enjoy a nice cup of tea.

I bought this tea when it was on sale thinking of testing it.. I have tried several organic ginger teas in the past and this is by far better than any I have used..Love the flavor and also the taste.. Great combination of ingredients.

I like that it has a very good flavor I didn't even have to add sugar.  The manuka honey gives it a nice touch.  Very good but I think it's a bit pricey.

I have never been a fan of herbal tea but I drink it when I feel a sore throat coming on. This tea is actually good and even better with a splash of almond milk;)

I love this tea

I love tea, I will be adding this one to my list

Love the taste

Loved this tea! Tastes great - it’s a gentle flavor and not overpowering at all. Will definitely stock up on these.

Great tea. Great taste

I routinely buy and drink this brand of tea, so I’m very familiar with how it smells and tastes.  All of the tea bags in this set had an odd “off” bitter/sour smell.  Additionally, the brand tags on the the teabags had a different color and font (this could just be new branding) compared to the tea bags I already had at home.  Finally, I opened them up and compared the tea inside.  The tea in this set was finely ground and lighter in color.  The tea in the bags I already had was darker and had a thicker chopped appearance.  I don’t know what happened, but I wanted to put this warning out there so no one gets sick from drinking whatever is in these bags.  All I know is that it’s definitely NOT the normal Pukka tea I drink.

Very disapointing. The product will expire in 10 days. Please, send a return label and refund me what i paid

I received this today and upon opening it, I was assaulted by a vile, visceral, vomit inducing package of the most putrescent odor to ever violate my olfactory receptors. I haven't wanted to puke this badly since my 21st birthday. I've worked in kitchens while the grease traps are being cleaned, and that is a stench even morticians agree is worse than dead, rotting bodies, and I would gladly inhale that just to clear my nostrils of whatever was in this box. The stench is so undeniably virulent that it melted my brain and made me eloquent. I cannot stress enough just how horrible this product is. It took every ounce of my willpower to keep the contents of my stomach from rocketing out my face and spewing across the room like a scene from a movie about demonic possession. And I HATE wasting money, so I opened every individual flavour and gave them a whiff. Only one of them didn't make my stomach contract like I was hit by a linebacker. I adore tea almost as much as Uncle Iroh and was willing to try the one that didn't cause an immediate visceral reaction. That's how badly I wanted a cup of tea right now. I took two sips. It was disgusting. I feel as if I've been poisoned and I'm running a fever. I've never ordered tea online before and I never will again. I only ordered this because there was a blizzard and the local shop was closed. The package was pretty.

We drink every different type and brand of herbal tea at our home. So when I found this lovely looking tea set, I was hoping to buy more for gifts. I use all of the different brands of teas that help relax and help sleep. I can eat almost anything and never have food or herbal allergies. But the first night when I tried the herbal tea in this set that is made to help sleep, I became violently ill within minutes of drinking it. I don't thorw up easily and have vomited about 6 times in half a century. But this tea had me exploding out of both ends with severe stomach pains. I could not get off of the toilet to vomit so while I was having explosive dairrhea, I was also projectile vomiting TEA and even the crackers I had eaten earlier in the day. I couldn't sleep for about 5 hours because of stomach pain and the explosions from either end. It was horrific! And then I noticed the name of the brand is PUKKA, and I am wondering if this is not some twisted joke by a psychopathic tea seller. I am seriously afraid to even try any of the other three tea sets I bought on Amazon, much less any more in this disgusting tea set.

I have tried six different flavors in this variety back thus far.  Not sure what the deal is, but they all taste of mushrooms and not much else.  I've tried single bags, doubling flavors up, etc.  They're all just weak tasting and not flavorful, at all.  I tried two bags together of the triple ginger and steeped covered for about seven minutes.  I could barely taste the ginger.  Right now I tried to drink the Love variety.  Just tastes bad.  On my way to dump it out.  I've heard good things about Pukka but I won't buy the brand again.

I received my purchase today and noticed that in the back of the box there is an expiration date of September of this year 2024. How am I suooose to finish all the tea bags in 2 months. I am super upset.

I was so excited about getting this tea and what a disappointment it turned out to be.

This was a gift, so no way to return. The packaging was nice and arrived quickly. However, it expires in under 2 mos. That is a short amount of time for 1 person to drink all this tea. Had I known, would not have ordered, or made sure was able to return without having the recipient do all the work. Would not have thought such a short time for the price, and not ideal when giving as a gift. The recipient who is a tea drinker, did not comment on taste, so feeling like it may be an over all flop.Disappointed

I have not taste the tea, however I did not know you can't return .....when I will give this to the people I was hoping to...they will have less than a month to consume it...what a waste

I didn't care for any of these teas and thought the flavors very weak. The package is beautiful though.

This tea is nothing like the Pukka in the store. It has no taste. The box has a Best By date that is different from the tea bags. Do not buy this. It’s also non refundable.

These are all so disgusting I threw them away I wasted my money on this they tasted so bad I should of returned but I don’t drive and I don’t leave my house and for ups to pick up from home is a fee I don’t know why it should be free with membership but I guess either way it’s by preference just cause I thought they were disgusting others might think they are great we all have different opinions and taste

These are the most tasteless teas I have ever had. Even the ginger (I used two bags in a large cup) just tastes like water. Seriously, I I’ll never buy this brand again. This feels like a cash grab.

The licorice tea scent is so strong that it has permeated all of the other tea packets and the boxes that it came in. It is a beautiful set, but ruined because of the overpowering licorice scent on everything.  Unfortunately,  this item is not eligible for return. Only purchase if you REALLY  like licorice tea and want it mixed with all of the other flavors.

I purchased this tea for my granddaughter for Christmas. I happened to ask her about it and she said it had ZERO flavor.  The product must have been old.  I was terribly disappointed. I will not purchase this product ever again

All of the teas taste exactly the same, don't be fooled by the individual packaging. I refunded this, and the other two boxes of Pukka tea that I ordered. Bad brand.

Box contained less teabags than advertised. Where I’m from, that’s called fraud.

This collection of teas is anything but delicious.I've tried hundreds of different teas, and this is one of the worst collections I've tasted.As soon as the box is opened, you are assaulted with the aroma of anise.  I like anise.  I put anisette in my coffee.  But too many of these bags have it in too great an amount.  Or licorice root.  8 of the 9 flavors have licorice root.  Too sweet.The Supreme Matcha Green has 2% matcha, the rest is green tea.  It's ok, probably the least terrible of the 9.I wanted caffeine-free good tasting teas, but I got this, yuck!

This is the first product that I have purchased from you that I am not satisfied with. I can’t even taste any favor to the teas. I have tried several of the teas and none had favor.

i purchased this as a Christmas gift but noticed that the expiration date is Feb1,2024.  That give the recipient only 1 month to use all the teas.  That does not seem right.  Very dissapointed I will look for a different brand.

I bought theses as a gift and the licorice was awful and when i used the green matcha it tastes like licorice. They seem old. I would not buyt again:(

I am sorry to say,This is not good at all! not only do you have to steep any of the teas for five minutes or more. even when you do that it tastes weak and not like a normal tea should. don't get this tea brand. Not worth it.  I usually like any kind of tea but there is just something about this brand. No matter what flavor you try it tastes just of hot water with  hardly a hint of whatever flavor you put!

I just received my package and the tea expires in one month!  Very dissappointed!

This tea gift box cannot be given as a gift, because it expires in less than 3 months.  It is irresponsible to ship near-expired products.

They sent me the gift box and it’s very pretty. Check dor the expiration dat because mine was expiring in a month. Returned.

The teas have no flavor, are very weak, in-fact you can steep for 30 minutes and still no flavor at all, the color stay very light, even multiple tea bags at once marginally improve flavor/strength. Its obvious that the teas have been sitting in a warehouse forever. even when you open the individual packages, there is no scent at all.

For the price, I was expecting bright aromas and flavors. It tastes mostly refill of wood and the flavors scape as very little original flavors

It expires in February 2024.  I don’t want to give as a gift that is almost expired

Almost every one has licorice. It makes the box smell awful.  I had to throw it away. I wish they would have made that more obvious. If you like licorice,  then go for it. But ew.

I was super excited to get this tea! I’ve become a tea girl as of late ! I am going to be honest , it was a huge let down,  no taste at all! I was so disappointed thinking I’d have all this great tea and bam ! Any idea as to why ? Any suggestions on a good brand that is similar w different teas ?

All the teas taste the same which is not a very good taste, so disappointing

I don't know what is in this tea, but it has no aroma and no taste. Three ginger should taste like ginger, but it and the other varieties I have tried from the box all taste like the box. Directions say to steep for 15 minutes, but even after 15 minutes there is no color and no aroma and no taste.

There are only 4 flavors and about 20 tea bags included in my order.

I don't mind licorice root but most of teas are pretty bland and disappointing. Not really a good variety for different flavors and other brands have better flavor. Not really a good deal either considering it's almost double price of yogi or other better brands at store.

Soon as I opened the box, licorice smell is overpowering. Now all the teas smell like licorice. Can’t return it since within 30 days. Don’t buy if you don’t like licorice!

Disappointed with this purchase. The bags are cheaply made so the tea gets all over the place

Rancid horrible cheap tea which went directly into the bin before it nauseated everyone in the house

This assorted tea box is overpowered by licorice.

Three people in my home drink hot tea, most of these flavors were disliked by all

I am disappointed this package arrived without a kosher certification even though it has kosher in its description online. When I tried to return I saw that it is non refundable.

These were just terrible tasting. Nothing soothing about this cup of teas. I dont know whT yo do with all these bad flavors

Everything tastes the same

Tastes quite watery despite the aromatic smell upon opening the box :(

The tea is not very tasty.

I wanted so bad to like the these teas. They have horrible aftertaste and all taste like licorice.

Pretty but terrible flavor

stay away sorry to say

I don’t like it

They all taste the same. Licorice! Yuk

It takes a long time to steep but even then it’s not very good. Sorry.

I red a few reviews and the rave reviews were inspiring and I love tea! I was so excited opening the box and seeing the beautiful tea selection! The only reservation I had was that there was an overpowering sent of black licorice and I am not a fan but I noticed that there was a pack that said peppermint licorice and I was thinking that was what I was smelling. I grabbed the elderberry pomegranate flavor and tasted it and all I can taste is the black licorice. If you like that flavor it's a dream come true but this is stuff of my nightmares. The packaging is beautiful though!

As a hot beverage lover, the variety of flavors "teas" offer are a delight. I purchased this for the variety of flavors. The packaging is a nicely decorated pressed paper box with 9 different slots for each tea wrapped in paper for protection. Pleasing to the eye, and "eco-friendly", you might think this would make a great gift, but sadly, with there being no sealable barrier between each flavor, the licorice, annis and fennel takes over all the other teas...My daughter says she buys Pukka in individual flavor packs and really enjoys their teas, but I really can't recommend the variety pack as I really don't taste a variety...

Tea is great and high quality. Bad part is evey single one smells and slightly tasted like anise/licorice. The packaging does not protect the tea bags and all the choices tasted somewhat similar. Would buy again if the packaging was better.

I love Pukka tea, but so unhappy that the "best by" date for this tea delivered today, December 29, 2023 is on Febrary 17, 2024. How am I going to use 45 teabags in a few weeks? One of the two boxes I got was for a gift. Embrarrassing and disappointing. Tea bags should be good for at least a year.

I was excited to get this, until I opened it. The entire group of tea, all smell like peppermint, licorice, ginger, and turmeric. I tried the one labeled love, which is supposed to be chamomile and lavender. You can’t even taste it because of all of the scent and flavor crossover from the other stronger flavored teas.

Pukka is one of my favorite tea brands, can’t recommend the tea enough. But the package came opened and with teabags missing. There is not an option for a replacement from this seller.

I wish that these teas didn't all have licorice root in them, because it overpowered the flavor of the other ingredients.

We've tried most of the sample set that I got my mother as a gift.  The box and packaging look great, but the descriptions don't seem to match with the taste and smell.  Maybe they need to come with a manual bag set and the spices unground so they maintain freshness.  Fresh ground cardamom, ginger or fennel normally generate rich flavors that do not match the flavors these teas generate.  It is a little suspicious all the packets say 5-15min and 100C, maybe a lower brew temperature or more precise brew time could help.

Nice packaging, but the quality of the herbs in the sachets was very poor - little/no flavor.

Purchased this wonderful collection of tea on the Black Friday special. Received quickly however the expiration date is February 2024, so I have a little over 2 months to use 45 sachets of tea...disappointing.

I am sad these weren't better.  The packaging looks nice and the flavors sounded good but they aren't.  Mediocre at best and the bags themselves are poorly made.  They often break in the cup which ruins the tea.  Flavors are weak and not very good.  The green tea described as 'matcha' is anything but matcha.  It's a stale flat roasted green tea with little flavor.

I was disappointed by how weak the tea is. I had to seep it for 10 minutes to get much taste. I frequently buy high-quality, organic herbal teas, and all of them are much stronger than this one.

This is great tea, but we received it 7/18 and the best buy date is 9/30. I feel like you’re dumping old Tea and the price wasn’t that great for something that was going to be considered old so fast.

Weak. Very little flavor....even after steeping covered for 15 minutes.I like the box & am using it as storage for my incense 🤷‍♀️

The variety of the teas is nice except that they seem old and light on flavor.... had to add 2 bags to one cup just to get the flavor I wanted

Not great tasting. But pretty packaging.

...and I DON'T like licorice at all. Only two of the teas have non-aniseed, licorice or licorice root ingredients. The whole box smells like it.Pretty packaging, and, as I said...if you like licorice flavor--you'll LOVE it!

While this may be a great product for some, I don’t care for the flavors, thus far. I will continue to try the different flavors and may change my rating. So far, I have tried Night time and Turmeric Glow. It did arrive in a timely manner.

For sure a large variety, they all taste the same. Every single tea contains licorice root which overpowers every other flavor that’s in the teas. If you don’t like licorice root then I would not recommend this at all. Beautiful packaging though.

Every tea except for one has licorice root.  Had I known every tea tastes like licorice I never would have purchased this.

The flavor was very underwhelming. I really enjoy tea, & there seemed to be more thought put in the packaging than the flavor.

I thought these would be strong because of the price.  They aren't.  Waist

Looked great but the licorice tea permeated everything in the box and they all taste like licorice now.

I love the tea however everything in the box smells and tastes like licorice it's pretty overpowering

Every tea has anise, it’s yummy but in every single blend? It was to much.

My husband and I are avid coffee and tea drinkers, so I really looked forward to receiving this gift box for ourselves as a little luxury. It's a nice collection, but the teas do not adequately sit in their slots and that throws off the presentation of this gift. If I were giving this as a gift, I would tie each set with ribbon to help them sit better before giving them, otherwise they go all over the place.It should be noted that there are only 5 kinds of tea and they are not equally sorted in the box.10x Turmeric Glow10x Elderberry & Echinacea10x Three Ginger10x Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey5x BlackcurrantI was supposed to get, according to the Organic Listing, "Supreme Matcha Green - Turmeric Glow - Peppermint & Licorice - Detox - Elderberry & Echinacea - Three Ginger - Love - Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey - Night Time". I would not have gotten this if I had known the teas were going to be different than what was listed. "An assorted collection gift set of individually wrapped specialty Pukka teabags, nine different varieties mixed in one box" - this was not the case with my box whatsoever.I give this two stars for the tea flavor discrepancy is not the same as advertised and the fact that there are 9 slots and rather than have a nice assortment of 9 teas, there's a a mismatched number of the amount of flavors.

Feel so bad for my friend that waisted money on 2 boxes of this stuff!  For starters....companies should make it clear if a tea has caffeine or not, after googling (which apparently many, many others had to also) found out the majority of their teas are caffeine free.  I love trying different teas...but....these all smell so gross I was only able to force myself to try two of them, and they were disgusting, one sip I shuddered and poured them out!  Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did not try them all.

There's a time and a place for licorice tea. That's fine.Every flavor tastes like licorice.If you're going to sell me a fat box of licorice flavored tea, just be honest about it. Don't try to be sneaky. It's licorice; I will find out.

hardly any flavor and expensive as a collection. and you can't return this items

The taste was too mild. It barely had any taste at all

The product description does not say the date of expiration.  I buy this product because I love the teas.  The boxes I just received expire June 24 … almost a month from now.  That’s not enough time to drink all before expiration.  I am upset and can’t return.

Bought it 3/26/24 andthe best buy date was june 23 2024. I feel it was too close to the purchase date. Also it would have been nice if the item was shrink wrapped to preserve the tea.

Can't recommend this tea.I had to use two tea bags when I make a cup.The flavor is good but these bags produce very weak tea, like mildly flavored water.

The packaging and assortment is great, but there is not much flavor at all.  Even if you steep the tea for 10-15 minutes it still only produces a very light taste.  If you like a light tea with not much flavor you will enjoy this selection.  Not for me.

It’s probably hard to believe, but I find most of these teas to taste the same. The overarching flavor is licorice/anise. I am not a fan; however, the box is cool. I used the box to make a gift and that turned out well.

I really like the Elderberry blend and the Lemon Ginger Honey is a really nice anytime of day blend. Others I didn’t try yet. Very disappointing that each time I opened a Blackcurrant Beauty that the bag stuck to the wrapper causing an explosion of tea the first time and unable to salvage any of the bags for this particular type.

I thought each individual tea bag was in a plastic type wrapper since they are all in the same box. Because they aren't the scents and flavors have mixed together. And I bought as a gift. I would not recommend.

Tea is super light. If you are an expert in tea! you probably won't like it.

I love all the name& flavors of the tea.but when I made them they all taste the same.but I did like all the cute name of them.

The packaging is beautiful!There is one flavor in the box that I was able to smell outside of the packaging. All of the other teas had a hint of the overwhelming flavor.

Other reviews state these all are heavy on the licorice and they are right. To me, they are all one note and taste very much the same, and I don't like  licorice.

Needed to double bag the tea to get the full flavor. Once I did that it was good. Wouldn’t order again tho

Missing the 5 turmeric gold.

I should’ve listened to all of the reviews. They all say the licorice smell/flavor is insanely strong and I ignored them but they were right. Every packet in here tastes the exact same bc they all have licorice in them. Good if you like licorice

I love the product! However, since licorice is in one of the flavors and they are packaged with other flavors, they ALL end up having a licorice taste.

Had I known it all tasted like black licorice I would've never have gotten it for that reason only... I wish it was flavored differently but everything else was good as far as freshness and the value

For people that have tried dieters teas know what i mean when I say there is a certain “after taste” to these.  Every one of them have that taste to them. It kills the flavor or what the tea is.

Having hot tea at night is nice, helps me fall asleep, but all of this tea tasted to much alike.

The packaging is wonderful, it makes a great impression. Unfortunately literally every single tea bag, save one (matcha), tastes like licorice. It’s pretty disappointing.

Some of the blends are not good to me.  Flavor was just okay.  Great package.

The flavor profiles of these teas tasted like they took random ingredients and mixed them together. Not great.

Most flavors are made with the same ingredients. They call taste almost the same.

Expensive

First of all it’s Fair Trade which is important to me. I received this as a Christmas gift and I was very happy. I especially enjoy a cup of tea each evening, it’s delicious and relaxing. I love the variety BUT whoever said each packet is marked if it’s caffeine free is WRONG. I threw away the pretty box and put the packets in my tea jar and the packets are not marked. It’s important especially when offering tea to a friend or if it’s in the evening. Big thumbs down so stars list for that

Pukka is good quality tea and I've tried some Pukka in the past. What I find is that they use a lot of licorice root in their blends (true with the blends in this set as well) which I find to be cloying. Licorice root can have health benefits so I don't object to the ingredient itself, but I personally am not a fan of the flavor.The teas in this set are not the teas from the current description. The blends are Turmeric Glow, Elderberry & Echinacea, Triple Ginger, Lemon Ginger & Manuka Honey, and Blackcurrant Beauty. My favorites were "Elderberry & Echinacea" and "Blackcurrant Beauty". Although the bags say you can steep these up to 15 minutes, I prefer a shorter steeping time. For me the flavor becomes too much if I do a longer steep.The tea bags were scattered across the different sections instead of being one type to a section of the box. I felt like this was a bit sloppy for a product that is marketed as a gift. The box it came in was nice enough.Overall these are interested blends of tea but they fall short of the mark for me due to the licorice root in every blend + the presentation issues.

I've been slowly making my way through the large selection of tea flavors. The amount of flavors, and their varying taste profiles, really makes this box a collection of hits or misses. On the other hand, such a large variety will allow you to quickly zero in on likes or dislikes and then you can specifically order the flavors that tickle your fancy.Matcha, Three Ginger, and Ginger and Manuka Honey are the clear favorites.  Flavorful with no odd aftertastes, a touch of stevia brings them to life. 5/5If you love black licorice and/or peppermint (which I do), it is very flavorful 4.5/5Then things start to get a little murky and the rest are strong 3's except the tumeric and echinacia  which are 1/5s and tasted very bad.Rose petal is like drinking the smell of rose flowers. At first I didn't like it, but over the years I've found it makes a great mixing tea with other flavors especially strong black teas.Overall, the collection itself is a 3/5, but remember the strength of this collection is you get to sample *9* different blends and decide what works for you.

I am not a tea drinker, but my mother is. I ordered this set of Pukka teas to be given as one of my mother's Christmas gifts. Upon receiving and opening this box, I was instantly greeted with an aromatic herbal fragrance that was very pleasant to my senses. The bags of tea were kind of scattered out of their slots, but otherwise looked fine. Before giving this as a gift, I will have to maybe place a sheet of bubble wrap over the teas to keep them from shuffling around before she opens the box. There was a nice assortment of tea flavors, but I was expecting at least 9 different flavors for her. We instead got 5 flavors, none of which were listed in this ad, so that was a little off-putting, although of the 5 flavor teas we did get, most I know she likes and enjoys drinking anyways. It just would've been nice to get her some new flavors to try.The box itself is very pretty, nicely decorated with flowers and gold foil. Needs a little prep before you give it as a gift, but is otherwise ready to gift.

This review is for Pukka Herbs Tea Selection Luxury Gift Box, Collection of Organic, Herbal Teas, 45 Count. First the packaging on this is very nice and it is a nice tea set. My issue with this set is you are not getting the set in the description or photos. You will actually receive the Pukka Herbs Support Selection Gift Box, Collection of Organic Herbal Teas, 45 Count which is a completely different set that only includes 5 flavors: Lemon, Ginger and Manuka Honey - Turmeric Glow - Blackcurrant Beauty - Three Ginger. Other reviewers stated the same thing so this seems to be a error somewhere in the listing or shipping process. The teas I did receive were good but be aware that you are not getting what is being advertised in the listing.

The tea has special taste. We like different flavor the tea has. However, the paper attached to the tea bag will lose color if it got wet, which is nearly impossible to avoid because I need to pour hot water into the cup. When that small paper lost color, you better don't put it on countertop because it can dye the stone color into the color of the tea, (green, yellow, pink...)

This was a “just because” gift.  It was perfect. Great selection of teas. Beautiful packaging.

The box arrived intact and as pictured. I bought this as a gift and while ordering I decided to try them myself. I’m delighted with these. I just ordered a third one now as a gift for another friend. I’m a coffee drinker but have been drinking tea on the afternoons lately because these are all so delicious. I thought some might taste strong or overpowering but that is not the case. My favorite is the the licorice peppermint. It has a unique and yummy flavor.

I got the tea for the girls for Xmas. They love the teas. Excellent flavors! We'll be getting more

As it’s great product is good packaging for gift

While the presentation was amazing and the smell was great. A lot of the flavors taste similar to licorice unfortunately, but she loved it still.

No complaints.

I bought this for a Christmas gift for my boss and she loved it so much that I bought it again when all the tea was gone. I highly recommend it. It's a beautiful selection.

I love this tea box mix! I first received one as a gift and loved the flavors, so bought another after finishing it. The fact that I can leave the bags in my water longer and get a stronger flavor without that gross bitterness is perfect for me.

The media could not be loaded.
                



The tea is great! You have to make sure it ships in Amazon packaging. It defaults to 'ship in manufacturing packaging' and it really shouldn't. The shipping stickers were all over the decorative tea box. Extra crappy if it's a gift. I managed to peel most of the stickers off, but it's a bummer.

I am not a tea guy, but my friend is. Got it for his birthday and he loved it. Told me all the flavors were good and a nice variety.

This was purchased as a gift so I really can’t review all flavors but the person said she liked it very much. In reference to appearance as a gift… the packaging was nice looking. I paired this with a tea bag holder and tea cup and it made a perfect gift (for a tea lover that likes to experiment with different flavors).

I really like pukka tea.They are good tasting and relaxing.

It tastes great

Package was beautiful, tea is high quality, my only problem was not knowing that nearly all the flavors I got had licorice in them, and I am not a fan, but that's on me. Great product!

cute packaging and nice variety. however, the whole box smells like licorice, and every flavor of tea tastes the same- like licorice. i’m disappointed. i’ve had pukka brand tea before but never experienced this!

Delicious teas for any time of day!  The box is pretty enough to leave out for company.  The variety of flavors means there's something for everyone to enjoy.

Didn't love them all, but definitely found some favorites. Packaging is very pretty, beautifully colored.

Different then what I was thinking, taste is off from what I like, but good variety not a bad purchase just different

Taste Fresh and natural

Delicious. Nice variety

Got these as a mother's Day gift and my mom loved the different variety of tea. I will be purchasing again for myself to try out.

Purchased this box as a gift for someone. For the price it is super cute and the quantity seems fair. Recipient stated aroma is good. Yet to comment on steeping smoothness or flavor.

First of all, the box of teas I received is different from the one shown on Amazon page.  There are 5 assorted teas - Lemon Ginger, Blackcurrant Beauty, Elderberry & Echinacea, 3 Ginger, and Turmeric Glow.  45 packets in all but more of the Lemon Ginger, Turmeric Glow,  Elderberry & Echinacea, and 3 Ginger.  There were only five of Blackcurrant Beauty.The box is absolutely beautiful and gift-worthy.  All of the teas are good.  My favorite is Elderberry & Echinacea.  They are all organic.  Although, the box I got was not the one I expected, the teas are still being enjoyed, and I do like the different flavors.

I really like the box and the presentation of this tea seat, but I was disappointed to find that three of the flavors included turmeric (only one had it in the name) which I don't like. I tried one of the non turmeric flavors (the berry one that wasn't elderberry) and it tasted... interesting. Two other tea drinkers tried some of the teas and seemed somewhat happy, so I am giving it 4 stars instead of the 3 I wanted.

Beautiful tea selection. I loved the box too, keeps the tea fresh. Any idea who makes these tea boxes ?

Box is very nice & appealing, however soon as u open the box all the teas fall down out of its compartment. If they stood in place it would be better so took off a star for that. As for flavor not sure, i bought as a gift for someone.

Good taste, great value for the price.

I found a bag of pukka lemon ginger & manuka honey in my cabinet. I have a bunch of teas and I think the ole lady put it in there. So I'm trying it now! Which is why I'm here, to purchase some more. I like it!!! Very smooth!!! Nice scent!!!

Great for gift

These are so delish!

I loved everything and was excited when it arrived 😊I ordered the tea for my Dad as a surprise gift 😄

Excellent quality, packaging, etc.

I bought for my daughter in law and she raved about how nice it was pkg. and how flavorful they were! Nice gift!

This variety pack is perfect for every mood on different days. The quality and The Taste is amazing.

this is a staple in my home.  Can't live without it.

Overall this product come in excellent condition and packaged well. I did my research with this company. They did a really good job with this. Thank You

The pleasure begins with opening this beautiful box! I love herbal teas and was looking for a good selection  to treat my family and friends and this was a great choice.  The teas are so different that you won't be bored. I really enjoy this collection and my friends liked it too. It can be a great gift to a tea lover 😊

What a nice assortment of tea!  I'm normally not much of a tea fan, but I want to get out of the coffee habit.  I picked this because of the assortment, and as all are caffeine free.  I've only had one this far, but I am so excited!  It tastes wonderful and no chalky after taste!This would make a great Christmas gift for a tea lover or even for someone like me who hasn't previously had good tea experiences!Delivery was super fast, too!!

She loved the variety in flavor and color. This is a really nice gift for tea lovers.

I like the quality of this gift. Packaging is nice and colors are bright and comforting. The tea was enjoyed and tasted great.

I was first drawn to Pukka teas because the boxes are so pretty but the tea is even better.  Such fresh, varied flavors for an enjoyable cup of tea.  The gift box is so pretty and colorful. Makes a really nice gift.

I bought one for myself and also as a hostess gift for a friend. Box is very pretty and it is a nice presentation for guests to select a tea or for yourself.

Wonderful little gift at a good price. I have enjoyed Pukka Teas and this offer gives me a chance to try more varieties. Definitely a winner. Get one for someone you care for. Do it !

I haven't tried all the tea flavors yet, but there is a wide selection. This box contains caffeine and caffeine free teas. I like that the individual wrapping can be recycled as well. The box did have a strong licorice smell, I haven't noticed the tea tasting all the same though.

Purchased for my brother for Christmas and he was extremely happy. Turns out, it's a favorite brand of his which i didn't know. So it was a hit! Nice array of flavors and beautifully boxed.

All the flavors are soo good! Perfect home supply of flavors for guests!

I originally got the Advent calendar for my husband and he liked it so much we had to try more. These are good teas with clearly high-quality ingredients. There is a lot of fennel and licorice in many of their varieties, which we LOVE, but may not be as good for others. We've been quite impressed with this brand and will continue to purchase from them.

We enjoy it

I bought two gift boxes for gifts. I love this brand of tea! The selection is great in the box. The box it comes in is super nice too. Cant go wrong with these.

I love these and highly recommend!

everything arrived perfectly and pukka tea is awesome

Absolutely hands down the best tea ever , wonderful flavors!

When you get the box you can smell the teas before opening! When you brew, it taste great with many different types of sweetener, from honey to coconut sugar. When I drink these teas, with my health problems, I feel energized enough to fo several projects,  go out to shop and errands, or just park walk with my walker. When my stomach bothers me,  the ginger or turmeric help easy the pain or harsh gas. I have bought 3 different boxes, everyone delicious and helpful! My sister and her foreign husband likes them too!

The packaging was lovely and such a nice gift in the ai tee when we all love a cup of tea!

Beautifully packaged tea gift set. It comes with a good assortment of tea flavors in a beautiful box. Great price point!

This is a good assortment of very good tea. Add Honey sticks to make a great gift!

I bought these for my mom as a just-because gift & she drank 3 a day until she ran out.I need to get her a subscription now!

I like all the honeys but with this assortment I can order what I like the most. Great variety pack/

I love the earthy, aromatic teas that Pukka Teas puts together - it makes you feel warm and relaxed. This herbal tea sampler is a great selection of some of the different teas that they create. So far, I've fallen in love with every flavor I've tried, except one (as much as I love tea, there's always that one or two flavors from a brand that I'm not particularly fond of). Also, these samplers come in beautiful boxes that are great for gifting!

Great Christmas present had all the different kinds she loved

I bought this for my mom as part of her birthday gift. She loves tea and is enjoying the variety of teas in this gift box.

Good tea

This company makes great teas. The package is beautiful and worthy of gifting.

I loved everything about this box.  A very nice gift for yourself or to give.  The tea was a very good assortment.  I really felt this box was put together well.  And it gives you a chance to taste to see which ones you enjoy more.  I am getting another box with different teas.

I love these teas and bought multiple sets as Christmas gifts!

I have enjoyed every flavor except Matcha. (Just a personal preference, other people may love it.) All the others tasted rich and flavorful to me. My favorite so far has been to mix tumeric with three ginger. It is a wonderful way to end the day!

I bought these twice before once was just to try them the second time was for my daughter’s baby shower it was a big hit. It’s also nice to have these in case you have guests… I’ve narrowed it down to a few flavors that I like extremely well, do not be afraid of some of the licorice combinations I definitely do not like licorice So the one that’s actually labeled as a licorice I stay away from however it’s in a few of the others and I can’t even taste it.

This is a beautiful box with wonderfully flavored tea. I have not tried all the different flavors of tea but the ones that I have are very tasty. The tea is very fresh. The longer you let it steep the more full flavored it becomes.This box of tea has made me very happy!! This would make a beautiful gift for a tea lover.

Very tasty. I drink these alot now

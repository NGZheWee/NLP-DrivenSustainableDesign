I'm pretty sure that was glue. My other bar finally dissolved and I just used this bar yesterday for the first time. Unfortunately I'm just outside the window of return. Companies shouldn't be able to sell faulty items. Return window shouldn't exist for situations such as this.

I have used the product every day for the last 4 weeks to give it a chance and I tried to give the benefit of the doubt thinking my skin might be experiencing a ""purge"" but it's just not the right product for me. I did see a slight improvement in the first few days but  that soon ended.  It's just too harsh and drying. My skin feels like I have a dried face mask on that needs washing off after I've used it; very dry and tight. The dryness has caused oil production to go into overdrive to compensate and oily skin = spots.  Yes, I never thought a tea tree product would cause spots but it has. It's also caused me to have more papules and flakiness. I do think Dr Bronners soaps are worth it but if you have rosacea or generally sensitive skin, avoid the tea tree one.

I have sensitive skin, so it's important for me that there aren't a whole bunch of chemicals in the soap.Now about my experience: soap copes well with its immediate responsibilities. The foam forms quickly and easily, you do not need to lather for a long time. The fragrance is fresh and herbal, and unobtrusive.After washing, there is no feeling of tightness of the skin, neither on the face nor on the hands.In general, there is a feeling that this is a good old soap that our grandmothers used: no chemicals and flavors, natural ingredients, and even paper packaging.My opinion: an excellent solution for sensitive skin.

Howe,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2014",4.0,"This was on sale at my local CVS a few weeks ago and I'd only ever heard good things about it, so I decided to get it. It was on sale for $3 each. I've struggled with mild to moderate acne on my face and since moving to Hawaii from Seattle, I've developed some body acne (back and chest). I love to use this soap for my body - especially those problem areas. It suds up SO well, which is one reason why I love this so much. I like to wash my body with this almost every day and every 2 days or so I'll use it in addition to my favorite exfoliating towelette (http://www.amazon.com/Salux-Nylon-Japanese-Beauty-Yellow/dp/B007IAE5WY/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) and I have to say, this routine has legitimately gotten rid of 95% of my body acne. I used to have some red zits primarily around my shoulders and now my shoulders are clear and I can finally wear tank tops and strapless dresses without feeling self-conscious. My chest has seen the same results. I've used salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide washes on my chest and back in hopes that they would get rid of acne but they didn't do s***. If anything, they really dried out my skin and made exacerbated the problem. So glad I found Dr. Bronner's. This is my new HG body soap!!!I've also use this as a face wash and sometimes shampoo. It works well and is non irritating (unless it gets in your eyes - holy hell). I previously used Dove on my face in the mornings to get rid of the ridiculous layer of oil that builds up over night, and I honestly still love Dove because it leaves my face feeling balanced and clean after I use it. Dr. Bronner's on my face works great (also removes makeup!) but it does leave a kind of weird residue feeling on my face after I rinse it off. However, when I dry off that feeling disappears. I still use it instead of Dove, though, because of the more natural ingredients. I highly recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

.The last time I ordered Tom's of Maine on Amazon, I was referred to Dr. Bronner's Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile Soaps. I was impressed first by the ingredients and then by the positive reviews and thought to try a few varieties. The first one I used so far has been Tea Tree. I have taken three showers so far with it. I was concerned at first because it had a funky smell, like no other I have used in decades. It was sort of a medicine-like smell. I supposed I am very used to perfumed soap smells. Yet, I found it to be a rich, well lathering, long-lasting bar of soap. I am becoming used to the aroma, but the jury is still out on it (the reason for only 4-stars). I still have to try the Citrus Orange and the Almond that I bought. One thing for certain is that it leaves you with a refreshing feeling after each shower.

Needless to say I was deeply disappointed with this product, more so than I could have imagined.The consistency is very liquidy and watery which was a surprise to me.  I wasn't expecting it to be thick and as creamy as what I normally use, but it was hard to tell the difference between this and water.  Consistency though was not so much a concern as when I washed with it.At first the smell was a bit strange, but then I realized that it smelled chemically and the closest thing I could equate it to was not peppermint but rather far more like vomit.  My hope at that point was to wash it off as soon as I got a lather.  I used this in my beard and my hair initially, and once rinsed out the texture left in my hair and beard was like i had just poured sticky machine oil residue to the touch in my hair.  I then grabbed my regular soap and had to wash out the residue.Throughout the day my skin has even felt warm almost burnt like its been chemically burned from just a minute of having the soap on the skin, and even though I used other soap to wash it out the faint smell of it is lingering throughout the day.  Now I can't wait to get home to scrub my hair and beard again to try to get that smell out.I must admit this is probably the worst shopping experience I have had with a product so far especially since i was excited to use it.  I bought 2 32 ounce bottles based on hope and they are both going in the trash.  I can only assume others must have a different expectation from this product or are used to natural soaps, or the product received was just different.  I wanted to make sure to post my experience though so others can see it.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

The unfortunate part is that there is no mention of formaldehyde in the ingredients.And by the time I got my act together to return it I missed the 30 days deadline and now I'm stuck with it.

Especially impressive, considering my skin is more oily than normal and naturally soft\smooth. However, the complaints that it's too intense on sensitive areas or your private bits seems overblown, at least to my male bits.

I even read a short blurb about it in Backpacker magazine.  I also wanted to reduce my footprint in the wilderness using a more environmentally friendly product.  In my opinion, the lore on this product is all hogwash.  In short, if you’re looking to use this to get anything clean, I wouldn’t recommend it.  I used this on an 85-mile backpack trip in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana.  I used it to clean my person, wash dishes and even to brush my teeth.  When used as a personal body wash, it doesn’t rinse off easily which can lead to dry skin and chaffing in sensitive areas when pulling down long day hikes.  I never felt clean after using this soap and had to use twice as much as other “camp” soaps.  After about 5 days (I was in the wilderness for 12 days) of using this soap to clean dishes, I reverted back to my old standby…river sand and small stones.  Even though I purchased the peppermint soap, it tasted like soap when used as toothpaste.  Let’s just say I was happy my trail partners brought along normal toothpaste.

I like Dr. Bonner's Peppermint Sugar Soap, so I thought I'd try the Hemp version. Waste of money. First, it's very thin and watery (see video). It feels diluted and squirts out at a wasteful high volume. Second, this soap hardens into a plug at the end of the pump. So guess what? You push the pump, and the soap sprays sideways, straight up or anywhere but into your hand. Very messy. I've learned to remove the hardened plug before each use. But sometimes I forget and have to wipe down the wall. Seriously? We've had liquid soaps for, what, decades?This version smells the same as the sugared product, but it's leaves skin feeling drier. A note on packaging: There must be 5000 words on the label, going both vertical and horizontal, all set in tiny, minuscule type rendering it illegible. One line reads: ""Enjoy body rub to stimulate body-mind-soul-spirit and teach the Essence Moral ABC uniting all free in the shepherd-astronomer Israel's greatest All-One-God-Faith!"" HUH??

I've heard it referred to as ""hippy soap"". I remember the ""peppermint tingle"". However, it wasn't until 3 months ago that I actually bought my own. I decided to replace my chemical-laden hygiene products with safer ones - relying on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database to guide me to a better place. There were quite a few items that needed to be investigated...I was looking for a price I could afford, high reviews, and low scores on EWG's Skin Deep. So I found body wash, soap, shampoo, dish rinse, laundry detergent, toothpaste...and then I found Dr. Bronners...one product to handle all those tasks. It sure made things easier!Just think about how all of those products are going on your skin at some point...and then being absorbed...multiple times a day, every day, for years...the bombardment of toxic chemicals is crazy and once you start thinking about it you realize how ridiculous our culture has become with no oversight whatsoever.Dr. Bronner's carries ""Champion Status"" at the Environmental Working Group's website that ranks products based on their danger/toxicity. This means they have signed a pledge to use only the safest ingredients in all their products. On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the safest), this product scores a 1. I think if you averaged the scores of all the products I have replaced with it, you'd get about a 5.I now buy it by the gallon and have just purchased my second one (3 months later). Do the math and I think my girlfriend and I will go through about 4 gallons a year with all the uses mentioned here.DILUTE DILUTE DILUTEBody Wash: The standard dilution here of about 20% soap to 80% water works fine. You can adjust to your liking/lather preferences. I had been using a Dial foaming hand soap in all my rooms and I've emptied those, cleaned them real good, and converted them to Dr. Bronner's foaming dispensers. I love the results. It foams up real good and the lather is good. If you want more, just up the strength (reduce dilution) a little bit. You may find this leaves a little ""tingle"" in certain spots that will be extra-noticeable with cold water/air - you may enjoy this or not...either way it's certainly not a big deal and you do get used to it. The other thing to get used to is that you won't have that slimy feeling on your skin that we've probably learned to associate with being clean. That's just the chemicals on your body...Hand Soap: Using the same dilution (20/80) and re-purposed foaming bottles, I keep this in all bathrooms as hand soap. Not much to say here and people compliment me on the smell of my soap...even if they wonder what the heck it is!Dish Rinse: Once again I go with about 20/80 in a squirt bottle in my kitchen. You'll be surprised how well it cleans. When you start seeing the bubbles/lather reduce, squirt a little more and keep going. Remember you're never going to get that insane never-ending foam/lather without the harsh chemicals, but you'll be surprised with how well it does on its own. I do find that if I wash something and don't rinse it off fairly quickly it leaves behind a little ""oil slick"" that is most noticeable on metallic items...but it's organic and safe...and if you just run your sponge over it real quick and rinse, it's gone. Not a problem at all.Floor Cleaner: Here I dilute it down to like 5% soap, 95% water. It doesn't leave any residue and cleans up nicely - the smell is good too...and it's nice to know I'm not just filling the air with chemical fragrances than can linger in my home for days.Shampoo: I keep some in a bottle at full strength and pour about a teaspoon in my hand, rub together a little, then put it in my hair and clean as usual...you probably need more if you don't have short guy hair like me. I might try to dilute this to 50% only because at full strength it likes to clog the little opening of the bottle with dried soap. It cleans my hair well and I follow it up with
Dr. Bronner - Organic Shikakai Conditioner Hair Rinse, 8 fl oz liquid
. My girlfriend's hair did not appreciate this method as much as mine did and so I've switcher her over to Yes to Cucumbers (or Yes to Carrots) shampoo and conditioner which is great as well!Laundry Detergent: I keep a gallon in my laundry room and put about 1/3 cup for an average large load. I adjust up or down depending on the size. I augment it with some baking soda which is really cheap. At ~$50 per gallon this is more expensive than your typical Tide chemical gallon but once you factor in that you don't really need (or I don't, at least) fabric softener, the price difference is not as large. If you wash with the chemicals you have them on your skin all day long...every time you sweat they're soaking into your skin...no thanks.Toothpaste: this is the only other time I use the product at full strength - and I may well dilute it a little soon. I like about 3 drops on my wet toothbrush. I know what you're thinking ""eww, soap in my mouth?!"" I'm not sure how the other scents would work but with peppermint, I had no problem with it. With just the three drops, it foams up quickly and feels and tastes clean. Brush as normal but one warning: don't take forever. Peppermint oil, especially at full strength, can burn your skin a little if left on too long. I find that if I brush for about 1 minute it's not a problem at all. Two minutes and my mouth is a little burnt - but it's not the end of the world and heals overnight. This is why I am considering going with a 1:1 ratio of soap to water and using like 6-10 drops. UPDATE: I have been combining equal parts extra virgin coconut oil and baking soda + Dr. Bronner's (for the peppermint/cleaning) as a homemade toothpaste and it's working well!",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 1, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

After reading on Reddit that this product is something for which quality has always been consistently high, then reading the amazing Amazon reviews, I couldn't resist. Who doesn't like a great product that is also all natural and not from a huge conglomerate company? But after using this for a while, I'm wholly UNimpressed. In the shower, the peppermint oil feels a bit like a chemical burn on the face (I'm not unusually sensitive by any means) and as a soap this product is so-so. We also tried using it in a foam pump dispenser at the kitchen sink. It works great for foam soap but after you wash your hands they just don't feel clean. I assume it's the oil but I'm not sure. Also peppermint scent is nice until you want to eat something hand-held like a burger or burrito. Then not so much. I have found that I like it as a shampoo but it is very liquid so getting it on your head is a little difficult, and you do NOT want to get this in your eyes. I would not try this on a pet--that would qualify as animal cruelty because I'm certain it would be too strong and give a burning sensation, not to mention the concern for getting it in their eyes or nose or ears.There's a reason that one reviewer found a half-used bottle at a garage sale.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

The clean soapiness smell does stay for a while but the mint part didn't.And I guess because of the coconut oil, I didn't feel as clean as I wanted. My hair felt sticky, I couldn't get my fingers through it without fear of breaking off hair and I'm not used to that. Definitely needed conditioner to make it manageable again. Not a good shampoo, lesson learned.My body didn't feel as sticky but it definitely felt like something was being deposited on my skin when what I wanted was to feel like I was cleaning stuff off. I can't describe it properly. I guess it's like washing your hands with hand cream instead of hand soap. I wasn't looking for dry tight skin but I do admit to wanting the feeling of sweat, dirt, the stress of the day, being stripped off before a sealant was put on.I don't know how I remembered so incorrectly about this unless the formulation changed. It's not bad, just not what I wanted in a body cleanser.Such a good deal on 2 of these bottles though that I will probably use it in combination with something else (as a 2nd step) or employ it in one of the household uses; with coconut oil being the second ingredient after water, maybe the wood floors and furniture Will benefit.",0,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Once I got all that cleaned up, I then had to locate lids that would work in place of the ones that came with the bottles.

McNett,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2012",3.0,"So this is my first attempt at using a more natural soap product.  I read such great reviews and was hoping to replace many different household products with this one.  I'm not completely sold on it but I do like it for a few things.  I have used it to wash my son's soccer shinguard socks which get pretty dirty and stinky.  This gives it a nice minty clean smell and gets out the dirt.  I have tried it as shampoo and my hair felt gross.  I tried it as face wash and liked it but was super worried to get it in my eyes and sting, though it did seem to clean my skin without drying. (Have since tried Dr Bronner's Lavender bar soap on face instead and like it for face wash.)I used it as dish soap and hand soap.  It didn't get really sudsy for dishes and for hand washing it made my hands feel dry.  Overall it did not replace 18 things for me as the label purports. I continue to try it thinking I'll just get used to it.  Hoping to use it in some homemade laundry soap ""recipes"" but no big high hopes.  Speaking of the label I almost didn't even buy it because of some very unusual preaching on the label (spaceship earth?!) but when I researched a little apparently the family left the label design to honor Dr Bronner though they don't necessarily push the same beliefs now.  Fair trade ingredients and a natural product are old school beliefs I'm glad they maintain.Check your local grocery store for the smaller bottles.  I paid almost as much for a 4 oz bottle through a seller on Amazon that a 8 oz bottle costs at Target or Kroger.  :(",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 1, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

Not only does it smell like Pine Sol, it feels harsh like a dish/clothes detergent (which is apparently one of the recommended uses for this product). After just two uses it irritated my skin so much that I had to return in. The label on the bottle is full of religious propaganda to the point that it is completely overwhelming the description of the quality of the ingredients of the actual product. It feels as if the purpose of this product is not to provide the consumers with a quality organic body wash, but rather to dispense the company's religious views and opinion onto general public.

So, I took my bath and washed my hair with this stuff at about 6:30...and now?  I am sitting here in front of this computer fighting sleep!  I started getting sleepy about 15-20 minutes ago and was wondering why I was so sleepy and the only thing I could accredit it to (besides another day older) is this product.  Also, although this is my first time using this as a shampoo I haven't noticed any adverse affects yet (I used an organic conditioner as well, so that may play into the hair being softer part of this).  At any rate, if anyone is looking for something to help get to sleep this may actually help, at least it helped this night owl insomniac.  Peace10/06/13 - I had to come back and rewrite this.  After using this product a couple of weeks, I noticed my skin becoming drier and I found that I definitely cannot shave with it; that is entirely too uncomfortable.  The sleep effect has also diminished but that may be because I have started some new ventures and am making myself stay awake to complete projects.

But the natural lavender does smell pretty pleasant, and I love the natural ingredients. The 32 oz. bottle is very large and well priced in my opinion.So far, I've only used the soap as hand soap in previously used pump dispensers. I diluted the solution with warm water, but it always seperates anyway, and you can see the soap pile up at the bottom of the dispenser bottle. One of the bottles I'm using is one from Softsoap. Regardless of what kind of bottle I use, this soap kind of just shoots out at me. Then if I try to shake and mix the contents, the liquid flies out of the dispenser.The castille soap is pretty concentrated, but can be used on its own. It doesn't seem to mix well even when I use warm water like I'm supposed to. I feel like I'm missing something. I guess I just expected it to mix better with water, instead of seperating so easily.I'm hesitant to use the soap for specific DIY products as of now. But I still use it every day, and it cleans very gently.

Even very diluted for a foaming pump, it still shriveled up my hands until they were tight, itching and then broke out in a rash. Lotion didn't even alleviate this, so it had to run its course which wasn't a pleasant experience. I got the lavender version and though the smell was very clean, it didn't smell like lavender at all.I commend the efforts of the producers and their use of ethical ingredients. However, more specific instructions need to be provided for people on how to use this very powerful soap. It would save everyone a lot of trouble and money. I know plenty of detergents I'd rather use on my skin than this soap.Update: Since I went from my usual moisturizing soap to this and moving on to other soaps, I found out I'm reacting this way with other soaps as well. I'm upgrading the rating from 2 starts to 4 stars, also because the company contacted me willing to show me some attention on the matter which I never cared to resolve.

Previously to using it, I only had Lysol and bleach in my house for cleaning everything. I used a lot of chemical varieties and sometimes felt dizzy from the smells. I saw someone using this product on YouTube and was shocked at how such a small amount of product can go such a long way.I bought this bottle over a few months ago and it’s still almost full, when you dilute it with water a little goes a long way. This is much more economic than buying spray bottles of Lysol and Clorox. It also smells MUCH better- the lavender one is great and fills the space with a subtle but pleasant scent.The only downside is it can leave an opaque film on some surfaces. When this happens I just buff it out with a soft cloth.

The ingredients list is the biggest plus. It has a nice lavender scent, though it does make me sneeze sometimes when I use it in the shower (not sure why). I chose to give it four stars because it is EXTREMELY drying on my skin, even diluted, when otherwise I have normal skin. If I don't moisturize after using this product, my skin gets an itchy, tightening feeling--this doesn't happen when I use any other soap. Almost feels as drying as dish soap! (My hands get the same rough whiteness between the knuckles with this product as it does after exposure to dish soap.)

For years I was picking up products from Dr. Bronner's, looking at the label, and thinking it was some strange ""Santavoodoo"" cult thing and putting it back on the shelf. Then I came across a reference to the company in another context and read all about the background and it is actually a great story from the history of a very ethical company. The original Dr. Bronner had some ""unique"" thoughts about what ails the world and the label reflects some of those thoughts. It's more in the model of eccentric self enlightenment than strange cult, the essence of which is that people need to love more in life. Today the grandson runs the company — with much love — and maintains the labels as a homage as well as all the customers want the original version. The grandson at one point tried simplifying the label and all the dedicated customers complained, loudly!It seems the reviews from all the different scents get shoved into this one list. Be aware that there are six or eight scents and you are likely not going to like ALL of them, but many do like them all. There is also an unscented version if you are sensitive to fragrances. All the fragrances are based on natural essential oils though so they don't use the many chemical recreations of a natural fragrance. No need to pan the entire product line if you run into a scent you don't like.I usually dilute the soap down with three parts water and put it in a foaming dispenser for sink side use. It makes a very rich and luxurious foam. You can buy the foaming dispensers on Amazon. I've just started using it in the shower as well full strength on a wash cloth. I'm liking it in the shower now because it rinses easily and leaves no soap residue. I have sensitive skin and left over soap will give me rashes so usually I have to spend an inordinate amount of time rinsing. Now not so much with Dr. Brenner's in the shower.I like all the scents, though the lavender seems to be getting poor reviews. You should be aware that there are two types of lavender scent that you can get generally depending upon what part of the lavender plant is processed. One is a floral scent that comes mainly from the buds and flowers which many associate with English or French lavender. The other is a more resinous scent that smells medicinal to many which comes from the other parts of the plant. The floral scent is of course more treasured because there is less of it distilled from the plant. The Dr. Bronner's Lavender is a perfect rendition of the resinous scent — which I actually prefer because I don't especially like strong floral smells.All the various versions are good though! Except the rose for me which is a scent that I would never even try. Rose / Geranium Oil is like nails on a chalkboard to me.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

My initial dislike of the castile soaps has changed. I mistook lack of viscosity for insufficient concentration.Although castile soaps are VERY watery compared to the thickness of the chemically processed store soaps, it is by no means deficient as a 'concentrate'.I've found that even by a ratio of 4 to 1 (4 parts water to 1 part castile) I have more than sufficient soapy lather reaction for hand-washing or bathing (I also add baking soda to my bath soap container). I use a soap 'foamer' for hand-washing at my bathroom and kitchen sinks, and it has worked out very well - and without gunking up the foamer mechanism.I don't really care for castile though for washing dishes or laundry, as it builds a film over time - even with a bit of baking soda added.(I'm currently still using a 'chemically manufactured' laundry soap - ECOS. EWG.org only gives it a 'C' score (A,B,C,D,F). I'm only using about one and half tablespoons (with 1/2 cup baking soda) per load. But until my circumstances change (financially) or I come across another (truly) natural solution that works 'for me', I'm kinda stuck with that right now.)This past year has been a real learning - and eye-opening - experience for me. I've discovered soapberries (favorite as my shampoo), and soapwort, in addition to castile. While I use Bronner's (and feel confident to recommend them) in a pinch, my preference is MRH's castile.Anyway, along the way, I've become more convinced than ever as to the danger of chemicals/toxins/pesticides in our products and environment, and equally, more committed to changing the 'way' I 'live' and 'how' I do things. Guess I am (very) happily joining the tree-hugger and ecology-freak ranks for sure.So, the bottom line, check out Dr. Bronner's soaps, but keep in mind that soaps like this 'are' different from the chemically processed soaps available in retail. Bend a little in your 'expectations' and you might be pleasantly surprised.And, fwiw to those who 'do' care - always check out your ingredients at EWG's products database (even some of Dr. Bronner's, in the past, haven't scored very well - but seem to be genuinely committed). EWG has also recently launched a mobile app to help 'on-the-spot' in the store.********Wow. This soap is so thin that it pours like water; it has no viscosity whatsoever.I'm divided as to how well I like it as a soap. My extremely sensitive facial skin reacted like I was using hot peppers. However as a body wash, it wasn't too bad; my skin felt a little 'tight', and only a wee bit itchy, afterwards but nothing that on that score would send me back to the use of toxic soaps that fill our shopping shelves. Also, fwiw, the location where I'm currently using this soap uses a 'water softner'. It is very possible that this might be a mitigating effect in my skin's response to the qualities of this soap. (My sensitive skin reacts to even the slightest changes in tap water that isn't filtered.)I have not yet tried it as a shampoo, so I am not yet able to offer my experience there, but may perhaps edit my review should I try the shampoo experiment.I did find the lavender smell from the essential oil to be a bit overpowering, which seemed a bit ironic since the soap solution seemed so watered down. Another reviewer mentioned that this same soap sold at Walgreens was of thicker consistency, so I might give it another whirl and buy it from them. Otherwise it's not worth the price it's currently selling for (about $16+).In all honesty, for me, I think I'll probably just stick with my soap nuts soap, since they've been SO great for my sensitive skin, scalp 'and' hair. They're a little more 'trouble' (distilling the liquid soap), but, again, for me, well worth the effort.",1,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

One drop for my hair and 2 drops in a small bin to wash my body. 3 drops in a spray bottle to do house cleaning, including cleaning the bathroom. The stuff lasts for a long time. Very concentrated so I know that for some people it may be too strong of a smell.The way to combat this is by adding more water. I got the lavender smell, because it scares away the bugs. Ever since I started to use this, no more roaches in the bathroom, bedroom or any place in which I use this at. I had this 32 ounce bottle for two months now and I only use 3-4 ounces of the stuff. Normally I have to spend so much money for detergents, dish washing soaps, soaps, shampoo, window cleaners, etc due to my sensitive skin and some of this stuff isn't strong enough to clean so I have to use more of it... Dr Bronner ended the hassle of buying so much stuff for cleaning. One bottle... that is all, so I save money and space. I love the fact that this company is very philosophical and it practices what it believes in. It is organic, Fair trade/practices, pays its employees fairly, doesn't test on animals, made in the USA, so much more. I would want to try the other smells to make a decision on which one will be my gallon bottle. I imagine the gallon bottle will last me the whole year.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 1, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

So many chemicals! My skin felt terrible and my hair felt greasy and my eczema was still awful.I have been using this product for shampoo/body soap/shaving/hand soap. I have had it for less than a week and I already feel a difference. My hair feels great and I do not need a conditioner after using the product as shampoo.

Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. Be sure to pick up a foaming pump dispenser. It will clog a traditional dispenser because it doesn't contain any anti-coagulant chemicals :) I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things.

Then, I simply combine these ingredients together in a large mason jar and stir the ingredients together well. Then, when I want to use the homemade laundry detergent, I pour a cup into each load of laundry and let the homemade laundry detergent do it's thing. Sure enough it cleansed the laundry extremely well leaving it smelling fresh and clean.I have also used this soap as dish soap for cleansing the dishes and it cuts grease and food particles from the dishes well.

I've seen Dr. Bronner's brand before in Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and the like.  I decided to give this lavender and hemp castile soap a try.  When this product arrived in the mail I quickly looked up how to dilute and use this soap.  I got an empty spray bottle from the store and took 1/4 cup of Dr. Bronner's soap and filled the rest of the bottle with water.  Once the soap and water are mixed, you can then go ahead and use this as a cleaner.  I've used this product on my furniture (tables, desks, etc), kitchen, bathroom, and I think the uses you can get out of this soap are endless, plus at 32 oz., you'll get a great value from this purchase.

I did not dilute it the first time I washed my hands and didn't like it so much so I tried different dilutions for cleaning, bathing, and shampooing.  Much better performance.  This bottle will last a long time.  Half filtered water and half soap is the one I use most frequently.  I keep small squirt bottles of diluted soap at each sink and in the shower.

Her skin decided to freak out and get super sensitive and, for once in her life, she started to suffer from break outs. Flash forward 3 years and I'm still struggling... until this soap came along. I had always heard that Castile Soap is super gentle. I'm also a sucker for lavender.True to its nature, it IS very gentle. I use it as body wash and face wash. For my face, I use a little bit with my Clarsonic face brush and after a couple of days, I noticed my skin clearing. I've been using it for two weeks now and my face is clear and my skin isn't drying out. I even use it as shampoo once a week as I have found that it does a great job at removing build up. I can't say enough GREAT things about this soap.The consistency is very different.

It is natural, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and smells great with only natural essential oil fragrance. We usually get the lavender but I also really like the almond one. Peppermint is ok too but a little strong/tingly for bathing use for me. My best tip: this soap works well as a hand soap, but is best in a ""foamer"" dispenser - if used in a regular dispenser it gets gummed up regularly and will sometimes come shooting out at an impressive pace and distance, which can get soap on clothes or walls, etc. Consider yourself warned :)I also think using the foamer dispenser makes it last longer and reduces the risk of clogging the drains, which this soap has a tendency to do over time.

Today I was trying to find a way to clean the rings in the toilet bowl. Everyone recommended Borax and either vinegar, lemon juice, or making a paste. I tried all and had zero positive results. I finally grabbed the soap, a sponge and with some elbow effort, I had three toilet bowls sparkling.

I am a man, with short hair, and I use right at a tablespoon of soap for a complete shower.I recommend this soap to anyone who wants an all natural way to cleanse their body. It's the only brand I plan on buying, for the rest of my life.I'm partial to the lavender and peppermint scents. The peppermint also makes a great cooling shave foam.

However, running out before our next shopping trip, I ordered from Amazon.  BIG mistake.  It arrived yesterday so I brought it in and had it sitting on the floor of my bathroom before I topped off the smaller bottle I use.  A few hours later my partner went to brush his teeth and the entire floor was covered in this concentrated soap.  I’m unclear if the bottle was defective or if the delivery driver dropped the box but there is a good third to half the bottle that is wasted.  I put the bottle with remaining liquid, inverted with the cap tightly secured, into a clean wash bucket and it leaked the rest out into the tub.  I don’t have anything to transfer it into, unless I ‘can’ it in mason jars.  And to add insult to injury, there are no returns or replacements on this product so I’m just out the funds.

I ran out of hand soap so i followed the instructions on bottle for hand soap, diluted as instructed but still same results only this time I started to notice that residue on my sink faucet, same residue I would feel on my skin (leaving my skin feeling dirty) residue that wouldn't have shown up on my sink had I used my usual hand soap.

I make handmade soaps and shampoo bars. I wanted to try a liquid baby shampoo that was non toxic for my 2 year old. I stumbled upon this stuff. Issue #1 this is labeled as a ""castile"" soap- a true castile soap is made with all or mostly olive oil!!! The first ingredient is coconut oil with olive oil coming in as 5th ingredient on the label, meaning they probably used a very minimal amount of it and nothing that would make this stuff ""moisturizing""! Coconut oil is not moisturizing. It is very cleansing and tends to strip all oils (which leads people to think its drying, however it isn't). With all that being said, this stuff will be good for cleaning dishes and around the house ONLY. This stuff is far too harsh for your skin and hair, especially for a young toddler!! I used it 2x on my face and it ended up chapping my face (kind of like a windburn) I have shampooed my hair with this and my hair is extremely stripped and dry now and it didn't work on my toddlers hair either. I wont be using this on our hair anymore. I will finish the rest on the dishes and maybe my laundry. I will just make my own liquid shampoo instead of purchasing any more even though I was trying to avoid the whole process of doing that.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": -1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

After reading all the positive reviews online I decided to try this for my 2 year old. I have been using another brand since his birth and liked it, but it did make his skin a bit dry, so after my last bottle of shampoo ran out I thought I try something different . The soap did not cause any skin reaction( and my son has a very sensitive skin) , however it leave the skin very sticky, even my hands after washing my kid are extremely sticky . the soap is very runny, and while it does not generate any foam at all after mixing with water, it make water in the tub look “foggy”, which is odd.The most important thing is the advertised use of this “soap”. The label has so much writing on it that I did not look at anything, but ingredients, and thought they look ok. My husband however studied the label, and while I can ignore and put aside irrelevant religious propaganda printed on this label, the fact that it’s advertises product that supposed to be a “baby soap” as a laundry detergent, floor and dish cleaner in addition to baby soap I found strange at minimum and it certainly made me not want to use it on my kid.",-1,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

We were using California Baby soap but, they changed their ingredients and we decided to jump ship and try this.  By this time, my son was already two years old (we'd faithfully used California Baby up until that point) and he was use to soap getting near his eyes and it being ""okay"".  Dr. Bronners has made bath time unbearable.  After a few times of accidentally getting into his eyes - he's now SO fearful of bath time.  We can coach him into the tub but, as soon as he sees the soap he breaks down, screams and begs us to ""put it back!""=/  I used some on my face and it BURNS your eyes like crazy!!  I would be scared too if I were him.I really don't know where to go from here.  Maybe soap free?  I don't want to go back to California Baby because of their standards and practices.  I think Dr. Bronner's is a fine brand - just find it hard to understand why they wouldn't try to make their baby soap tear free.  Maybe they can't?  Anyway - this is not a good soap for babies/toddlers that might be squirmy and might end up with soap in the eyes.

Soaps usually have a high ph which may be the cause. I normally use a “beauty bar” which uses more mild surfectants as opposed to real “soap,” and has a lower ph which works better for me.

It's not a pleasant smell. It wears off after a couple days, but I think I need to find an essential oil that I'm not allergic to, that will smell better.I used this in a pinch to wash my hands. I literally used a tiny drop (undiluted except from when I wet my hands) and it lathered enough that it felt like soap. I had touched a stinky used sponge, and that smell sticks to me. Dawn doesn't get rid of that smell. This stuff did, and I could tell that the unpleasant smell of this castile soap wasn't just covering the even worse old sponge smell. Then I washed my hands with Dawn, and the smell of the castile soap was lightened.I did make a hand soap recipe (given on the bottle). The unpleasant smell sticks with the dilution of this recipe as well.All in all, I'm not sure if I'll purchase this again.I will use it for my 2.5 year old for all his baths and won't use another kind of soap on his body, to see if it takes care of his skin patches.

Bottom line, look elsewhere. I can't comment on any other use for the soap, and I must point out that this soap does not claim to be sold for cleaning CPAP supplies. However fo those looking for a soap for cleaning CPAP supplies, here are my comments:I read a recommendation to use this as a soap for cleaning CPAP supplies. It is ""okay"". I like that it does not foam as much as other soaps I've used. I have sensitive skin and had absolutely no reactions to it, so great there. I also like the natural, biodegradable ingredients in it, with no extra chemicals added, etc. However, I find it leaves a scent behind that I do not like for my CPAP (not strong, but annoying -- I want to breath air at night not perfumes/scents). It also makes the water surprisingly cloudy, which both concerns me and makes it harder to find small pieces at the bottom of my wash tank. It does not seem to leave any residue, but it did appear to make the plastic of my heated tube cloudy -- I don't understand why it would do this, but also concerns me. I will be looking for another soap.",0,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

First, my hands stayed dry from using this and the back of my left hand broke out in a rash. After a few weeks of treating the rash and it not going away, something told me to stop using the soap to see if that made any difference. Sure enough, once I stopped using it the rash started clearing up. I'm not sure why I had a bad reaction this time. The second issue was it always seemed to leave a filmy buildup in my bathtub.

The soap is gentle, suitable for sensitive skin, and versatile in its 18-in-1 uses.2. **Multi-Purpose Use:** The versatility of this soap is a standout feature. I appreciate that I can use it for various purposes such as face wash, hair care, laundry, and even dishwashing. It's a convenient all-in-one solution for daily cleaning needs.3. **Gentle for Sensitive Skin:** The Baby Unscented variant, with no added fragrance, is gentle and suitable for sensitive skin. It doesn't cause irritation, making it a great option for individuals with skin sensitivities, including babies.4. **Vegan and Non-GMO:** The commitment to being vegan and non-GMO aligns with my preferences for ethical and sustainable products. It's reassuring to know that the soap is produced with these considerations in mind.5. **Effective Cleaning:** The soap effectively cleans and lathers well, providing a satisfying cleaning experience. Whether used for personal care or household tasks, it delivers on its promise of cleanliness.6. **Slight Concerns About Price:** The main concern is the relatively high price. While I understand the value of organic and ethically sourced ingredients, the cost may be a factor for some consumers, especially when comparing it to other multi-purpose soaps in the market.7. **Packaging and Size:** The 8-ounce size is convenient for various uses, but for some users, especially those who use the product regularly, a larger size might be preferred to enhance value for money.8. **Eco-Friendly Initiatives:** It's worth noting that Dr. Bronner's has a strong commitment to environmental sustainability and fair trade practices, contributing to the overall positive perception of the brand.In conclusion, Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap is a high-quality and versatile product that aligns with ethical and environmental values. I rate it four stars, with the main consideration being the price, which may impact its accessibility for a broader audience. If price is not a deterrent, this soap offers a reliable and eco-friendly option for various cleaning needs.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 1, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

This one had a few things that we were sensitive to at first, but we cleared them with allergy elimination treatments, and we now use it every day.  My kids still don't like to use it on their hair, but I do.  It does make the hair feel like there is a residue left behind in it, but there is a rinse for that which can be purchased separately.  Many people report using lemon juice, etc. for this purpose.  I have curly hair, so I don't worry about it.  As long as I just set it while it's wet and forget it, it is fine.  If I have to comb my hair out during the day, it would need to be wet down to fix it.  The rinse has been reported to fix this issue as well.  For the body... I would recommend to use it and rinse it off of sensitive areas right away as it can be irritating if it is left on for too long.  Also, do not get it in your eyes... it will burn like H.E. double hockey sticks.

Velez,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2013",4.0,"I shower and wash my hair with this soap.I do have psoriasis on my scalp and a few spots on my face and after reading so many good things about this soap I had to try it. I ended up loving it. Its a nice mild soap and I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week. As any one with psoriasis knows, this skin disease is still without a cure, it can only be treated. :( BUT, I find that using this soap really takes away the itch and flaking. The redness does fade and the ingredients seem to have a moisturizing affect as well, no more skin cracking and pain. This soap should be apart of a daily regimen to take care of yourself and keep the psoriasis from flaring up, so its no cure obviously, but its a miracle to find, its the only soap that doesn't strip your hair/skin and make it dry like the Neutrogena brand does and it leaves your skin/hair with a very light clean scent where other shampoos smell like tar. The price is very reasonable as well, hold up your thumb-that amount of Talconex (an ointment for psoriasis) cost $500.00 out the door at a pharmacy! So I like this method better. This product has met my expectations and with a healthy diet (If you have psoriasis you know about the type of food you must avoid) you don't need to break the bank with meds.

I can't wait to try it as a detergent and a floor cleaner .. So many great recipes to be find online for this environmentally (and vegetarian) profit! Also, initially it does seem very pricy, but for also every use, you are diluting it. The only downside would be it does burn your eyes so be careful if you use it on your face and despite what many people say, not good in a DIY shampoo. It coats your hair with an oil consistency and does not come out.. It looked like I did not just wash my hair and have me dandruff. Some people swear by it, and good for you if it works for you, but I am sticking with an organic shampoo.

I want to like this soap more than i do. It is great for body soap and hands. While washing it feels wierd but no suds and you dry super fast. Leaves a nice softness to your hands but not oily. So 100% perfect for camper life. Very little water needed to rinse. It works okay for dishes as well. Worked good as far as i can tell for handwashing masks. However i hate it in my hair. It feels heavy and nasty. Feels u washed and gummy and frizzes and tangles. I purchased the hair rinse as well and it doesn't help. So overall it's great for anything except hair.

What truly sets it apart is the use of natural and organic ingredients. Unlike many commercial soaps with synthetic chemicals, Dr. Bronner's uses pure, organic oils such as coconut, olive, and hemp. This makes it gentle on all skin types, including sensitive skin like mine. Another fantastic aspect is its versatility. Dr. Bronner's isn't just for hand or body washing; it’s an all-in-one product. I’ve used it for everything from washing my hair to cleaning around the house, even washing my pets. This multifunctionality makes it incredibly cost-effective and reduces the need for multiple cleaning products. Additionally, the soap is environmentally friendly, with biodegradable ingredients and packaging made from 100% recycled plastic! In terms of performance, the soap lathers well and leaves my skin clean but not stripped of its natural oils. The scents, derived from essential oils, are refreshing yet not overpowering. My favorites are Baby (unscented), Almond, Peppermint, and Lavender. Overall, Dr. Bronner's Liquid Soap is a superior choice for anyone seeking a high-quality, natural, and versatile soap. If you’re looking for a soap that excels in every way, Dr. Bronner's is definitely worth trying!",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 1, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I took four yesterday with the hopes of some nice, Triphala-facilitated XL BMs, but no luck.This is the first Triphala product I've tried. And the little bit of scientific research on the three plants that make up triphala pretty much says its mild, safe, has no appreciable side effects for most people, and may have a two way laxative effect through peristalic stimulation (stimulant laxative) and a bulking agent. I think loose triphala or encapsulated might possibly be better than these pressed tablets. They are smooth, nice looking, and easy to swallow, but they look like they could pass right through some people.I'll continue to take it, and maybe it will work when I get up to ten tablets a day!

And bowel blockages, even the unintentionally self caused ones, can be deadly, not to mention they can be awfully painful. Fiber therapies such as psyllium husk can be downright bombastic, and the brutal effects can come over you in a very unpleasant and unexpected manner; pain, almost enough to match the aforementioned bowel blockages; gas strong enough to tranquilize a triceratops (and who's to say how many homosapiens as well); uncomfortable, abdomen distending bloating, ugh. And, if you're blue collar like me, chances are that you could literally be stuck serving customers while a hot gurgling mess threatens to reign terror upon the masses. Meanwhile, you are left clenching your cheeks and praying for your luck to hold out long enough for a mad dash to the restroom- not to mention long enough to get your drawers down. Nobody wants to be that guy! Triphala can help ease the strain a bit more naturally and much more, shall I say, predictably. I love this stuff. I had concerns that the supplement might result in explosive urges or cramps, but it didn't and I'm glad.

I really like that it’s just compressed material and there is no gel capsule for your body to have to digest. While I don’t mind the gel capsules, if I can avoid the extra material, I’d prefer it. These are a nice tapered shape, thin, easy to swallow, and have a pleasant, albeit minor, smell.The method I’ve settled on for using triphala is to take one of these tablets at night right before I go to bed, just with water. The next day I notice a positive difference, although nothing very major, which is good. Everything just moves along easily. When I first started taking triphala, the following morning my stomach would feel slightly queasy, almost on the verge of a stomach ache, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. After a week or so, I stopped having that feeling. I take maybe 2 or 3 a week, not every single night. I find that taking 1 every couple or so days works just fine for me, and I don’t really have a need to take it more often. While I know this varies from person to person, I have a long history of stomach issues and taking this at this interval seems to produce the best result, such that everything seems to function much better than I’m used to.I’ve also read the claims that you can use triphala as a way to lose inches around your stomach. While I don’t take it for this purpose and assumed it was all false claims, I do have to say that I notice my belt fitting looser and I need to tighten it more than normal. I haven’t weighed myself to see what kind of difference there may be, and it’s most likely just water weight, but it was a pleasant surprise.",2,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 1, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 1}"

I bought it back in December so that I could stop buying plastic containers and just buy in bulk and refill my glass container. I put it away in my pantry for a few months until I ran out of the soap a already had. It was a huge disappointment. I have normal skin, never very sensitive to products, but the first time I used it, it seemed to sting my skin. Also dried out my skin terribly. Only used once and then tried to return, Amazon would not accept the return because it was past the 30 day period(I did not realize it was only a 30 day window). I contacted the manufacturer and Dr. Bronzer would not stand behind its product either. The fact that it was over $40 with tax is ridiculous!

A friend of mine is a mechanic and I convinced him to try this because his hands were always black with dirt even when they were ""clean."" He was shocked that his hands could actually be CLEAN clean.I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works magically. If you used cream or liquid products and left them to sit for a bit, it would help to use a little bit of oil (olive or sweet almond oil are my recommendations) to break it down a bit before using soap. Follow up with a silicone free conditioner for your natural hair brushes to keep them properly conditioned because they are hair after all.I also highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with skin & heat rashes under skin folds or bra areas but use the unscented version. I work with unhoused and elderly people who struggle with this and medicine is not always covered by insurance. I'm not recommending forgoing medicine when prescribed, but this soap may be a great option as prevention and to heal the skin as well.

It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things.

All green EWG rating. If you doubt that chemicals and toxins attach to your cells and cause health issues, you would be mistaken. I had a neuro lipid IGL test after having significant health issues and found chemicals in common products attached to my mitochondria/cells. I now use Suzanne Somers organic cosmetics and go to an organic hair salon. The test revealed quite a bit of info, but seeing chemicals in normal everyday soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, and hair dye attached to my cells was unexpected.

Our favorites are this almond scent and the orange scent. We use the bars and the liquid. They are all fantastic. If I had to find something negative to say, it would be that during the dry winter season, the liquid soaps can be drying to your skin. We add avocado oil to the hand soap dispensers to help with that issue. We use the liquid soaps in foaming dispensers and they foam great. Just add a few drops of your favorite oil to it to help with the drying effects during the winters. Since the oil will simply sit on top of the liquid in the dispenser, we give it a shake before each use to make sure that the oil is in every squirt.

I prefer a more neutral soap.Positive:Packaging is a plus printed with 100% water based ink and definitely support fair trade!

What I appreciate most is that it doesn’t strip my skin of moisture like some other bar soaps. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished, thanks to the organic oils in the formula.Another plus is the soap's versatility.

It’s gentle yet effective, which is a rare find in a bar soap.I also love that Dr. Bronner's is committed to using organic, fair trade ingredients, and that their packaging is environmentally friendly.

Have bought a years'+ supply.  :-)Additional comment added on 8/29/12 - My wife pointed out that since I started using this harder soap, she has to occasionally treat the drain pipe with Liquid Plumber.  (she's very handy with knowing lots of stuff - I'd be lost without her)... anyway, she said that with the Irish Spring, she never had to do that.  It appears the harder soap is congealing in the trap after the hot water has flushed the tub down after the shower, and it's leaving a layer of scum that attaches to the trap as the last of the water cools down.  It's not a show-stopper, but it's something I thought I should add to the review.  I do remember this was a problem in my parents house too, as all soap was much harder back in those days.Original review starts here:I've been looking for a while for ""all natural"" ingredient soaps, and I have bought several to try out.  However, when getting one bar at a time, of a product that chain stores just don't carry (at least in my area), the prices tends to be rather high.  Anyway, I hit on this one, and I really love it.  The scent is pleasant, but not overpowering.  It cleans really well, and most importantly, my skin has improved since using it.  Interestingly, the bars last a lot longer than the commercial soap I used to buy (Irish Spring).  I don't think this is completely due to size, but also to the ""hardness"" of the bar.

I started buying this about 15 years ago when Bronner himself was still running the company and he only marketed by word-of-mouth and didn't deal with chains, along with all the religious preaching that came with it.  I read about the soap in some offbeat magazine my uncle had a subscription to and I liked what I heard.  Apparently supermodels were using it, so maybe it would work for me.  Before finding this, I went through a lot of different mainstream soaps and my skin would always be itchy, especially in the winter.  I remember feeling like a bear in the woods trying to get at the itches on my back with a door jamb shimmy dance I would do.When I started using this (first the liquid, now this bar soap which I prefer), within weeks my itching was cured.  Something they put in most soaps doesn't agree with my skin, and this stuff doesn't have it.  Somehow it cleans the skin without stripping the natural oils.  I've tried other castille soaps that have come on the market since, but they're sub-par based on consistency and smell as well as on how my skin feels.  Those still are superior to the mainstream soaps, but Bronner's is still king in my book.Something of note, in the hopes that someone of import at the company reads this review, is that the marketing has changed significantly since the old man passed away.  It was kind of a quirky thing with all of the ""all-one"" preaching on the packaging, but I really miss reading it sometimes.  I also noticed that I started seeing it at not just chains like Whole Foods and Henry's, but at places like major supermarket chains and the like.  That's all fine and dandy, but please, please, please, I beg of you, don't change a thing about how the soap is made.  There's something almost magical about this formula.  Simple it may be, but changing anything with the soap itself would be a disservice to Bronner's memory in my opinion, and to your loyal customers.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Dr. Bronner's is a good brand we know we can trust, without the preservatives found in breast tumors. These bars are larger than other natural brand soaps we've purchased and last nicely.Last year my cousin's and their parents fought over their soaps, lol. We all have sensitive skin but my cousins use this for deodorant and shaving cream because they're allergic to almost anything else. So this year I went for this six pack, which worked out to be a better value anyway.My shipping info said they'd take over a week but Prime had them shipped to me in two days and in time for Christmas. These smell so intoxicatingly good, even though they're individually wrapped, everyone could smell them through the wrapping paper (I used over the soap wrappers). Again, they were a hit! Smile. Buy with confidence.Christmas 2016 - Another 6-pack to go with gifts and the quality is the same. You can smell them through the delivery box. Awesome soap, gentle but a real treat. Uploading a photo so you can get a closer look. I didn't bother wrapping them this year because everyone knows what they are before they pick them up anyway. Smile.

These are tiny bottles that LOOK just like the regular sized bottles that are four times bigger. And they sell these tiny bottles for exactly the same price as the larger, full-sized bottles are sold in many brick and mortar stores. Is this a coincidence? I don't think so. I believe that they use these photographs and the price of the bottle to deliberately give the misleading impression that these are the regular sized bottles. Unfortunately, these tiny bottles are packaged in exactly the same way as the full sized bottles. This allows the seller in this case to pull off this misleading sales tactic. Save your money, buy the product from another source. I ended up paying a total of $22 for a tiny amount of this soap. The soap is great. The tiny bottle is ridiculous and misleading.

I can't use it on my face because I will breakout with alot of acne. When I used it on my body however..it worked really well..at first....and I was able to see all the dirt coming of my skin..but it left my skin super dry. But at least my legs and back wasn't breaking out in pimples as much..Sadly it didn't last..now I have acne every where and it's not going away..and my neck and chest have become red and itchy and scaly and feel sensitive to the touch!

I’ve used this on several flowers as well as some vegetables and the issue I had is now pretty much obsolete so I would recommend. I needed something that my dogs wouldn’t be drawn to and that wouldn’t hurt if they tried but none of the 3 are interested in. I got the mint which also helped deter deer which I’m not sure if I got lucky or they don’t like the scent. I think great alternative to insecticidal soap.

I was delighted to find this one available on Amazon. It is a great product, gentle and effective and makes you smell wonderful whether you are using it to shower, shampoo, wash dishes or clothes while camping, or a million other applications.

The trouble begins when you start to wash your skin, at least on much of mine.  Almost immediately after the first application, my skin began to burn like fire, especially on my face and groin area.  It was so painful that I had to use another soap and a lot of water to get the residue off as soon as possible.  Even then it burned for a few more minutes before going away.Reading all of the other compliments posted here for the product, I notice one other commenter that barely mentioned this problem.  This is totally baffling.  For me, it meant throwing the stuff out.  I was so annoyed that I didn't even save it for something where it might work well, like a flea bath for the dog.

The smell was so refreshing, I picked some up at the local store, even though I was a little dubious about the packaging. And I've never looked back, although I've been shopping in all sorts of sort of stores looking for more.The great thing about this soap is it's not cologne or perfume, so there's no strange tang, no incense smell, no after taste. It's made from oils - the label says ""organic oils"" (not sure what ""organic"" really means but it sounds nice) and it's biodegradable. I love the freshness, and what my nose tells me is the authenticity, of the peppermint.  I've also tried the Lavender and Eucalyptus and like them just as much (I may like the Eucalyptus even more, but the hubs is a little reserved about koala smells).And, although the hubs is really picky about soap, complaining about pine scented holiday soap (I do not care - it's important to enjoy the holidays in every room), non-anti-bacterial soap, overwhelmingly anti-bacterial soap, unscented yet somewhat scented soap soap, and ""flakey"" soap (not clear how to deal with that), he actually requests this soap.

Then, the product itself was RUNNY and did not lather whatsoever.  It actually didn't do much other than turn my bath water into milk.  When you first apply it on your skin, it's silky, but as soon as it's rinsed, you're left with a film on your skin - and in your bathtub!  Even the cup I normally use to rinse was coated in a white film.  Ew.  I made the mistake of using it as a shampoo; OH MY GOODNESS NEVER EVER USE IT AS A SHAMPOO!  It left my hair tangled, limp with the aforementioned film, and I looked like a hot mess.  The only positive I can find is that it smells lovely - but I love Almond anything, so it might be overpowering to some.  It was nice to shave with.

Davis,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2016",1.0,"My review is for the NEW LABEL.  The soap inside the bottle is, of course, as wonderful as ever.  I hate the new label.  All the interesting, fun, inspirational, and sometimes wacky sayings and statements from the original Dr. Bronner label are gone.  They are replaced with a label filled with nothing but statements about ""fair wages for all workers"".  Don't get me wrong, I support fair wages, but I do not want to see it on the label of my soap, especially when it is replacing the beloved traditional label.  Plus, this seems like the wrong group to preach this message to, since I am guessing most people buying Dr. B's soap already support fair wages, so you are preaching to the choir.This was a very poor marketing choice.  The original label was a huge part of the appeal and joy of buying Dr. B's soap.  You made a grave mistake changing it.

I'm not a ""green"" freak and don't care as much as some about chemicals in my cleaners. This item has taken the place of almost all my other cleaners! So far I've made multi purpose cleaner, shave cream, glass cleaner and a bunch of other things. Who knew it could do so much and make my cleaning cabinet so much more spacious! I am now trying out as a ""no poo"" shampoo. If I can use such a small amount to wash my hair and body then I'm in. I can't believe how much money can be saved by going green. Green cleaning supplies are quite expensive, but you can save a ton by using Castile soap with some other cheap products to make your own.The only reason I gave this item four stars is the smell. I'm starting to get used to it, but wish I would have gotten fragrance free and added my own scent with essential oils. I will do that next time. You can add other scents to this, but the almond smell is always there in the background and pretty strong on its own.A few tips for using this product:Do NOT mix with vinegar, it will destroy the oils in this product, many Pinterest pins give recipes that mix vinegar and Castile soap, don't do it! This is not recommended for use on hair due to it being so high alkaline, can be mixed with honey and lemon juice to make a bit more acidic, what your hair needs, and lastly...a little goes a very long way! No need to use concentrated, mix with lots of water, same cleaning power with less waste and your bottle will last a very long time.I've only made a small dent in this bottle after make 3 gallons of all purpose cleaner, 32oz bottle of concentrate hard wood floor cleaner, 32oz bottle concentrate carpet cleaner, 3-16 oz shampoo/body wash bottles (no poo shampoo), 1 gallon shave cream (will last DH and I at least a year!) and several other cleaners I can't think of off the top of head right now.I will be getting another bottle of the baby kind next time so I can add whichever scent I want without having the almond smell lingering in the background, or forground without adding a ton of essential oils!

Price for volume, it comes out much cheaper than most soaps and similar to what other reviewers have said, you really don't have to use much at all in order to lather up a storm, so this bottle should last me for at least a couple months.As far as quality of the product, the smell is pleasing (at least for me) but is a much more muted lavender than most other lavender smells, even more so after finishing showering and drying off. I have noticed immediately after rinsing, unlike other soaps I've used, there is a somewhat sticky or rubbery feeling on my skin which slightly irks me but the sensation fades quickly.Even though I bought this to be used as a body soap, I got curious about all the 18 uses it claims it has and did some searching. Turns out it can be used to wash clothes, floors, or even to wash your teeth (though I haven't brought myself to try it in that regard yet).I'm extremely happy with this purchase and definitely will be buying more when it runs out.

I thought ""maybe this product isn't for me?"", but I decided to give it one more chance and I'm so glad I did!The second scent I ordered was Rose, and this one smelled amazing! Now, it's my new go-to.The lather on this is top notch. The product is concentrated, so you can get away with using small amounts but still creating a bubbly lather.The cleaning power is great. Skin feels squeaky clean WITHOUT it feeling dry or stripped.In fact, I think this works a bit too well? Because I use self tanner, and this product washes my fake tan off in a week! (Prior to using this product, I could get away with doing a fake tan every 2 weeks, but I guess this product is doing a superb job at getting rid of dead skin cells).I LOVE that this company is vegan, cruelty-free, organic, and fair traded- It's a brand you feel good about supporting.My only concern is that this soap is pretty much made up of several organic oils, which may be a concern going down the bath drain?

Started with peppermint of course, then later almond, eucalyptus, and finally lavender. It has kept me clean of body and mind (well, no, not really of mind) for the past half-century. It's mild but incredibly effective, with no harsh chemicals, weird ingredients, or irritants. I have tried it (diluted) as a mouthwash (effective, but YUCK, it's soap!), and it even works on squeaky hinges. The peppermint is truly rejuvenating, and lovely in a warm water foot soak. Lavender is actually a very calming scent, good for an evening bath or shower. There are other flavor, my spouse likes rose, and there's even an unscented version.

You do not need much as all, so it lasts for a long time! I have a little pump bottle in my shower that always has the lavender scent in it. In the last 3 months, I have tried many different versions/recipes to use it as a shampoo (including rinsing afterwards with an apple cider vinegar rinse and diluting it significantly with both water and coconut milk) and it just didn't work for me. My hair was all ratty and knotted, which isn't usually a huge problem, and it felt pretty dry and brittle. But that doesn't make me love it any less!TIP!When using this as a body wash, I don't love how thin the consistency is because I feel that I use more than I actually need. So what I have begun to do is thicken it at home! I simply use magnesium chloride flakes (which you can find here on Amazon, and which I choose to use because I can always use more magnesium in my system, as I don't get enough from my diet most of the time) diluted in water. You could also just use table salt! I take 1 TBSP of the magnesium chloride flakes (or table salt) and put it in about 1 cup of water and stir it until it is thoroughly dissolved. Then, I add the saltwater mixture about 1/2 tsp as a time to about 1 cup of castile soap. Be sure to add just a little bit at a time and stir the soap thoroughly between each addition of the saltwater or it will ""break"" the soap and won't have a uniform consistency. I usually use between 2/3 and 3/4 of a cup of the saltwater to get to my desired consistency. It's a thicker, white, lotion-like soap instead of a thin, tan-ish water-like soap. It's not as creamy as a synthetic lotion would be, but I really like it and it doesn't take too much time and saves the amount of soap I use as a body wash over time!",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 1, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It’s soap.Nothing really to explain, except that I DILUTE THE LIQUID SOAP with water almost to a 3-1 ratio of water to soap… so it lasts a lot longer, of course, but PRIMARILY to prevent it from drying inside the pump nozzle, thereby clogging it completely.I mean, I was already diluting it on my hands by wetting them before introducing the soap, so there’s no downside to adding a relatively small amount of water to the dispenser anyway. I now have the habit of squirting it on my hands before adding water from the faucet.Much better than manhandling the dispenser only to shorten its life, and to shooting a solid lump of soap clog out the nozzle followed by enough soap to wash a small car.Anyway, if you like the smell of eucalyptus, which is admittedly a bit astringent and not for everyone… and you’re willing to accommodate the challenges of any liquid soap… there’s nothing to dislike about this.They even still have the dissertation on essence gospel on the bottle for all you customers who miss reading cereal boxes.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

We were excited about its multiple uses, and decided to use it to refill our pump hand soap dispensers. BIG MISTAKE. If you read ALL of the fine print, you will see a note that states that it will clog pump soaps. THEY ARE NOT LYING. We had noticed that the soap dispensers were a little clogged, but kept rolling with them for some time. Eventually, I went to get soap one night and a large amount of the soap went directly in my eye. Per the fine print that we found (after reading that it clogs pump soap dispensers), I flushed my eye for 15-30 minutes. I woke up the next morning with a horrible migraine and a beet red eye. While I don’t blame Dr. Bronner’s for this, as the fine print does state that the soap will clog dispensers, I wanted to make sure to warn my fellow human beings who may not read all the directions!!As a body wash and household cleaner, it works wonderfully.

We are a family who has become enlightened to all of the chemicals in our lives. We chose to give up the chemicals and experimented with a few products. This product is OUR FAVORITE. We use it for shampoo, body wash, hand soap, most house hold cleaners (great mixed with vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon), leather cleaning, detailing the car, dish soap, and carpet cleaner.It has a great lather for everything. I would say that you have to get used to the texture of your hair when using it as a shampoo. It cleans really well but your hair will not feel slick like with other chemical filled shampoos. I use coconut oil BEFORE washing and then wash 2 times and I love the way my hair is after words. I do not blow dry so it gives it a wonderful soft natural look.Skin care is great with this product. We have sensitive skin in this house.. later found out that we just couldn't tolerate the chemicals in other products. It washes off great and leaves the right amount of natural oils on the skin. No tightness or drying effects like usual products. (We also use coconut oil as lotion nothing else.)A little bit goes a LOONNNNG way with this product. The price is well worth it because you can do SO much with it. I have had this bottle for almost a month and have barely even used an inch (from the top of the bottle) and have made 1 bottle of dish soap, 2 bottles of cleaner, 3 weeks worth of showers (we take daily showers), and detailed our cars, cleaned the carpets, well you get the idea. It goes a LONG LONG way.Lastly, I will mention that it smells GREAT and is good for the environment. What's not to like about it??? Try it, and you will love it to.

I mix a capful with water ( you can find the ratio online), and after a few spray treatments, the aphids are gone! I like not dealing with harsh chemicals and this is safe to use around children and pets. This  quart size container is a money saver and I trust I won’t run out anytime soon.

I actually had the chance to try before buying (at my local co-op).  The bad part is, I was fooled into thinking this product worked.  It appears to moisturize for about 5 minutes, but I've now come to realize that after those few, spare minutes, I must reapply.  It leaves a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes me think that the ingredients aren't being absorbed.  My skin still feels very dry.  The fragrance is simply OVERPOWERING.  I love patchouli, and I even bought the lavender scented lotion, and they are both extremely loud - some of the most highly scented perfumes I have ever used.  The first time I applied it at home, my boyfriend asked if I had sprayed perfume.  I am so very disappointed in this product.  Never again will I purchase anything from Dr. Bronner's.  I think there is so much fragrance in this, it is actually stinging my skin.",-1,-2

My biggest grievance would be the oily residue it leaves, both my hands and everywhere they've touched has a shine to it now.If you're looking for a moisturizer, there are many products which far exceed this one.

If you just love the smell of patchouli, this IS for you!I've become more cautious about how much and when I use this lotion after a number of people (including a stranger at the store!) have commented on my scent. Mind you, this is long after I've applied it and honestly can no longer detect the smell myself! And, as another reviewer mentioned, the scent does pass on to clothing...people have been able to smell patchouli on me even when I'm not wearing the lotion, due to the scent transfering onto my sweater or coat. I LOVE the smell of patchouli oil, but realize not everyone shares my affection for it. ;)",-1,1

It doesn't have scent to bother my allergies.  It cleans well but is also hydrating and gentle enough that I can even use it regularly to wash my face.  When I had very short hair, I also used it as shampoo.My only complaint with it, and the reason I can't give it five stars, is that it tends to break in pieces about 2/3 of the way through the bar.  I end up trying to fully use crumbled pieces of soap and way too much of it ends up in the drain.  With how pricy it is, this waste is painful.3/16 update: I wanted to post an update because I still use this soap and it no longer breaks the way it used to.  So upgrading to 5 stars and adding this note.",1,2

The scent pours out of the box when you open it, but by the second or third use of each bar, the scent exponentially drops off.  It seems like all of the essential oil is in the outer layer of the bar - perhaps a manufacturing quandary.  This is not much better than unscented castille soap that can be purchased for a fraction of the price.  Sadly disappointed.

The liquid Castile soap you could use as a shampoo, body wash, hand soap at the sink, overall degreaser…we used it in the kitchen, around the stove and to clean the bathroom. And we would dilute it so a little went a long way. I believe a full bottle back then was about $7.50 (it’s now about $14)So I tried the bar soap…not impressed at all. Seemed to dry out my skin, I can’t imagine using this on my hair. Certainly can’t use it for much else than hand and body so it’s not versatile like the liquid soap.And the price! My bar lasted me for about 2 weeks of daily use and then when it got small, it broke apart into pieces too small to use.At full price, this is about a $6.50 bar of soap that will last 2 weeks of daily use.Dr. Bronner’s went from being the cheap alternative organic multi-use to severely overpriced hipster soap. Fortunately you can get a generic version of the liquid Castile soap for about $9.00 at Meijer that smells similar and works just as well. That bottle will last you for 5 months and it’ll work al through the house. Do the math.",-1,-1

I use it for everything...everything. I could list so many things but I think I will just give a couple of ideas people might find helpful. This is great for people who have REALLY dirty jobs or greasy jobs. A friend of mine is a mechanic and I convinced him to try this because his hands were always black with dirt even when they were ""clean."" He was shocked that his hands could actually be CLEAN clean.I use this to clean my makeup brushes and it works magically. If you used cream or liquid products and left them to sit for a bit, it would help to use a little bit of oil (olive or sweet almond oil are my recommendations) to break it down a bit before using soap. Follow up with a silicone free conditioner for your natural hair brushes to keep them properly conditioned because they are hair after all.I also highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with skin & heat rashes under skin folds or bra areas but use the unscented version. I work with unhoused and elderly people who struggle with this and medicine is not always covered by insurance. I'm not recommending forgoing medicine when prescribed, but this soap may be a great option as prevention and to heal the skin as well. Just make sure you dry the skin very well and apply something like Aquaphor as a skin barrier after.",2,2

No obnoxious fragrances! Doesn't dry out your skin! Cleans surprisingly better than most other soaps, and I'm mean for blue collar stuff like automotive grime. Great for people with multiple chemical sensitivity or fragrance allergies. I especially like the almond. It's subtle and pleasant. Not that it matters that much, the scent doesn't stay on you. It washes away with the soap like it's supposed to ;) I wish this was the soap found in public restrooms. Actually, most public bathrooms aren't as bad with the fragrances. It's the private bathrooms that are the worst, when you are FORCED to use soaps that make you hands smell LONG after you wash them. I hate that! Anywhoo, I love this soap! I love the company behind it too. Be sure to check out the work the company does lobbying against the DARK act (Denying Americans the Right to Know) and to help Fair Trade amongst other things.

The test revealed quite a bit of info, but seeing chemicals in normal everyday soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, and hair dye attached to my cells was unexpected. I use EWG to rate products and I steer clear of all products that have unnecessary chemicals.

Our favorites are this almond scent and the orange scent. We use the bars and the liquid. They are all fantastic. If I had to find something negative to say, it would be that during the dry winter season, the liquid soaps can be drying to your skin. We add avocado oil to the hand soap dispensers to help with that issue. We use the liquid soaps in foaming dispensers and they foam great. Just add a few drops of your favorite oil to it to help with the drying effects during the winters. Since the oil will simply sit on top of the liquid in the dispenser, we give it a shake before each use to make sure that the oil is in every squirt.

Since coming out West, with the dry air and hard water, my hair has been limp, to the point I could see scalp and thought I may have been losing hair. But since using this, my hair is very full bodied and it is easy to manage. The first time I tried it, I had doubts, because when I ran my hand through in the shower after washing it with this soap, and my hand barely moved. You could say it was squeaky clean. I like the peppermint scent. I also used it as a body soap. But where this product really shines is as a  natural shampoo. I ordered the bar because the website said the bar works better with hard water. It lathers easily. I ordered the recommended Dr. Bonners citrus rinse but haven’t tried it yet. All in all, I’m really happy with this purchase.Update: Although I still like this soap, I don’t think I’ll be buying the bar anymore, because I found that it doesn’t last long. It disintegrates fast, into a soft sloppy mess. I’ll try the liquid.",1,1

The first time I tried it, I had doubts, because when I ran my hand through in the shower after washing it with this soap, and my hand barely moved. You could say it was squeaky clean. I like the peppermint scent. I also used it as a body soap. But where this product really shines is as a  natural shampoo. I ordered the bar because the website said the bar works better with hard water. It lathers easily. I ordered the recommended Dr. Bonners citrus rinse but haven’t tried it yet. All in all, I’m really happy with this purchase.Update: Although I still like this soap, I don’t think I’ll be buying the bar anymore, because I found that it doesn’t last long.

My son is 4 months and I’ve been using it since he was born..in the beginning everything was fine I would bathe him daily with this soap with no issue. However, lately I’ve been noticing his skin is getting increasingly dry. I stopped using this soap for about a week and I noticed his skin is more supple and less dry.Now for me, I don’t think my skin has ever looked better lol I noticed my face is so much clearer since using this soap. I suffer from very oily skin but this soap just seems to balance out everything. So I found a soap for me but unfortunately I have to keep looking for one that will keep my son’s skin healthy.*PS-this soap is not tear free and don’t even think about washing inside your vagina with it or you will be burning lol",0,0

I used it again just to check if it was in fact the soap and not something else and as soon as I used it again the rash came back.

It burned and my skin was so tight I was putting moisturizers and oils on 3 or 4x a day just so I didn't feel uncomfortable. So then I said I'll try it in the shower. Just as bad, I could feel my skin tightening and drying out in the shower. I bought a two pack so I have two bars of soap i can't use. This should not even be a bar soap.

You feel clean and not filmy as with most soaps.Cons:* Price! You would think that a soap without the additives that drive up cost would be less expensive than its peppermint/wintergreen siblings.  However, not so.* Lasts no longer than other commercial soaps.  At this price you would hope that the bar would be denser or longer lasting, but (again) not so. I've had some milled french hotel bar soaps last longer than this bar did.Best uses:* Folks who have skin or allergy issues that are willing to pay a premium price for a soap with no additives.* Hunters who want to be scent-free in the woods.I'm happy with its performance, but its a niche product and not a good value. Cut the price in half and then let's talk. Otherwise, a bar of Ivory is a much better value.",0,-1

As I had a mild reaction to it. I believe that reaction was caused by the citric acid content.  This reaction was localized to my face and privates and not the rest of my body.However, I tried it on my face again, and had no reaction. I am now using it regularly on everything, and love it.  It is a very mild bar; doesn't dry out my skin, yet still effectively lifts dirt and unwanted excess oil.It holds up well to water as well. Making it a great value. Highly recommended.",2,2

I have weirdly sensitive skin even to completely natural products and even when I find a product that doesn't react with my skin usually if I use it for a while I then become irritated by it, go figure! I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and have had no problems it has also left my skin feeling SUPER soft, very very clean and has been reducing my breakouts massively! It has no smell which is great, the only downside for me personally is when you wash it off it has that not very nice feeling that happens with virtually all bars of soap when your skin gets very grippy (the only way I can explain it) apart from that I will be reccomending this product to everyone I know!",2,2

Easy on my ultra sensitive skin. I’m a long time Clinique ultra mild customer (15 years?) but wanted to make the switch to bar soap to lower my plastic consumption.

Watson,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024",5.0,"I transitioned to this soap about 4 months ago because I wanted to get away from toxic soaps.  I have always had to do unscented soaps, so it was a task finding one.  This soap leaves a dry film feeling to my skin, but it does not irritate me.  I was happy it was sold on Amazon because when I went to Walmart to get more they were out so while standing in Walmart I ordered from here and was glad they offered a 2pk option.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a natural nontoxic soap.",2,1

I have the bar soap because I thought it would last longer & be easier to work with (for my specific needs) rather than the liquid soap; however, I would like to also try the liquid baby mild soap. I decided to purchase it to use on my 4 month old son. He has very dry skin & several rough, scaly patches (I believe it may be eczema but he hasn't been medically diagnosed yet) and I brought the soap in hopes that the Castile soap would help his skin retain moisture. At the time I was using Aveeno baby soap & lotion, and I felt that it may have been drying his skin out. So far I've been using dr. bronner's for about a month & and I've definitely noticed a difference in his skin. I've also changed the lotions I use on his skin. Along with using this soap to bathe my son, I also use this soap to scrub out poop stains before putting the clothes in the washer machine. I breast feed & my son has frequent (about 1-3 times per week) blow out diaper messes. When he has a blow out I hand-scrub his clothes in the sink, before putting them in the washer. Dr. Bronner's removes poop stains better than the baby dreft laundry detergent that I use !! It removes the stain phenomenally. And I've never noticed any damages to the color or quality of his clothes' fabric.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this soap for bathing, as well as a clothing stain remover. I look forward to using other Dr. Bronner's products & exploring what other uses they may have.",1,2

Tons on the ears, a nose, and nipple piercing. You know the confusion around what to use, right? Some say use Dial Gold, others say only salt water, some swear by the H2Ocean spray. I swear that I’ve tried them all and this soap is by far the BEST. After two of my latest piercings, my new piercer recommended Dr. Bronner’s and said don’t fall for the BS products like H2Ocean spray and I wish I listened to him. I’ve dealt with keloids galore but this soap (and only using this) has made the healing process super easy and FAST. The soap goes by a little fast but not as fast as some others I’ve tried like unscented Cetaphil soap bars. From now on I’ll be using it every time I get a new piercing and I think you should too if you’re in the same boat.Also I have eczema and the last few years I’ve only been using unscented soap and this is so nice to my skin and never causes a flair up.",2,2

Just a little tidbit for those who have my skin conditions. This soap comes in both a bar and a liquid form. I can use the liquid on my face (I really like it as a hand soap) but I can only use the bar on my face.

In my opinion, it was a fairly large bar. The first time I used it, I liked it. It felt wonderful on my skin, washed off well, and left me feeling clean, soft and smooth. Not dried out at all. I kept running my hands over my arms because they felt so great.Even though this is an unscented soap, it does have what I would call a typical soap smell to it. It's not unpleasant, quite nice, and I assume the 'unscented' means they didn't add any scent to it, so you're just getting the natural smell of the ingredients. It makes no difference to me, but if you want a product that actually has no smell, this won't be it.The bar is lasting a good while compared to what I'm used to. It's a pretty hard bar, not soft like some of them that seem to wash half away the first time you use it. I've taken many showers with the same bar, and still have many to go.I think this is a great soap, and I will definitely be buying more. I will probably also try some of Dr. Bronner's other varieties.",1,2

No. Want to use it as shampoo? Definitely no. My hairs feel horrible while using it and after. Want to use it as dish soap? No! It doesn’t clean at all.

I bought Dr. Bronner's ""Baby Unscented"" Pure-Castile Soap because I wanted to make my own foaming hand soap. It actually creates a great, light foamy hand soap when used with the
InterDesign Foaming Soap Dispenser Pump, for Kitchen or Bathroom Countertops- Clear/Chrome
(less than 1/5 liquid soap to 4/5's water).I got some sweet orange and lemon grass essential oils to scent it with. Loved the texture of the foam, however I found the dispensed soap had an underlying unpleasant scent. I assumed it must be the mixture of the two citrus oils and, not wanting to waste the entire contents, I tried to put up with it for about a week before I finally decided to dump it and try the sweet orange essential oil, which I really love, by itself for scenting the soap. After making up a second mixture, I was disappointed to discover the foam still had the same unpleasant underlying scent.I got the bottle of Dr. Bronner's out and took a sniff - and found the source of the unpleasant odor. The soap itself smells akin to rancid vegetable oil. Not surprising, I guess, considering all of the oils that go into making it (coconut, palm kernel, olive, hemp, jojoba).With all of the good reviews, I have to assume that I just got a bad or ""old"" batch of Dr. Bronner's ""Unscented"", but at almost $20. for a 32oz bottle, I really don't want to take the chance on another purchase of the same. Though it makes a great foaming soap, it leaves my hands smelling like rancid vegetable oil so, as far as I'm concerned, it's unusable. But, I love the quirky label and that earned it an additional star.",1,-1

But you like to think that maybe it just smells that way in the bottle and that if you bathe with it than surely it should be fine and the smell wash off with the water, but no. My husband and I washed our baby in this and my mom held her afterwards and had an asthma attack because of the strong smell of this stuff, and the smell only came off when baby was washed off with something else. If you want something without a smell or that smells good or you have asthma, than you should definitely keep looking. Very disappointing.",-1,-2

My reason for a 3-Star rating is not because I consider this to be a poor product, but rather because I think it is promoted as a moisturizing, balancing skin cleansing option when it is not. This duly noted, plenty of people will use it and have no problem whatsoever - but this is the case with nearly any product we look at. In the case of liquid Castile soaps, these soaps perform the duty of cleansing in a very serious way. Any product that can effectively clean your floors, dishes, laundry, etc. and also doubles as a skin cleansing agent - may just turn out to be somewhat too harsh on skin. I love the fact that this soap is easily used as a base to carry lovely fragrances, and it is definitely affordable. However, for people who struggle with any dry skin concerns, this soap is far too detergent in nature to be used on a daily basis, and as a licensed esthetician, I advise against its use as a daily soap for body or face. If you do plan to use this for body, please do dilute. Full strength Castile soap is far too stripping for the skin. The skin is a living organ with a delicate pH balance and natural fats that are important to keeping it soft and supple. Cleansers that effectively remove ""everything"" remove all the ""good things"" too. Again, this is a great soap to play with, to make interesting concoctions with, and although many people swear by it, I have it to be far too drying and the source of patchy, itchy dry skin far too often.",0,0

And I apparently wrote that a few days ago before I wanted to use it!  (I have memory problems.) NEW INFO;  I don't remember if the bottle was shrink wrapped or what, but it wasn't spilling.  I put it in my bathroom and when I went to use it, discovered that the flip top had been torn off, and I didn't do it.  There's a hole in the screw on top lid to get the soap out, but no top of that lid to flip down over the hole.  Two problems w/ that.  Arthritis and I drop things. Soap spills when it's open.  Also,  If you don't put the ""lid"" down, the soap will congeal and stop up the hole out of which the soap is dispensed.  So I will be spending a lot of time with a pin and hot water trying to clear it.  I suspect that someone returned it???  After breaking off the lid that closes down over the hole?

I use it for so many things and I love it. Dr. Bronners soap gets 5 stars. But I purchased this specific one because it says it's unscented, and I like to mix my own soap mixes and essential oils for various scents. So I figured unscented would be the way to go. It's not overpowering of a scent, I couldn't even describe a particluar scent: but it's overpowering in another way where most of my essential oil scents get blended right out with this. I can mix essential oils with Dr. Bronners lavender: and end up with a beautiful smell, not even lavender: because of adding my own oils. For some reason, this one however just unscents everything right out. Sure, I could use a crazy amount of EO's but they are expensive, plus that much oil adding messes up the compound of whatever it is I'm making. Still works as Dr. Bronners soap is expected, just disapointing that it's overpoweringinly ""un-scented.""",1,1

So that's pretty good. I used it for showers and for cleaning socks. Next time around I plan on going for a different scent. ""Baby Mild"" has been okay, it's pretty neutral if not kind of gross. Next time with a different scent, I'll perhaps dilute it so my supply so it will last even longer (more value!). Think about the price I paid, (18) divided over a year... that's a pretty good value already. I always use vitamin E moisturizer directly after using it on skin, but even when I didn't, I didn't have problems. This soap is always good (and natural).If there was one thing I could change, what would it be?:Easy. The cap. Only a month or so after using this bottle, it fell and the cap was destroyed. This was very sad because I was unable to find a replacement cap anywhere at home. So I went ""capless"" until I was able to transfer the remaining soap into a new container.Anyways, I don't plan on ever using a different soap for showers ever again.

I will get use to the fact that you don't have to have sudsy foamy soap to be a good product.  Use on face, body and hair.  Loving it.  Just took time to get use to the change.",1,1

One bottle of this will last you months. (Maybe weeks if you have an exceptionally large family of cleaning freaks).When I started down this path, I only used it for refilling my hand soap containers. I dilute it at about 10 parts water 1 part soap - it makes for a very liquidy soap, perfect for the foaming containers which I have since confiscated from friends who still *gasp* buy new things of soap when one goes empty. Before I had the fancy shmancy foaming pumps, I just used the normal soap pumps. It worked fine, but it was runny which took a bit of time to get used to.But because it is so diluted and still cleans very well, I had a crazy amount of soap on my hands. So I started using it to clean other stuff. Dish detergent was the next thing on the list - I dilute it maybe a touch less than the hand soap (maybe 8 parts water to 1 part soap) and it works equally as well as the name brand dish soap that I used to buy. Only a few times have I felt the need to let things soak a bit longer than I would have otherwise, but even then I tended to soak overnight, so no real change. If you're as crazy as I am, you can add some citrus essential oil to it to help with the degreasing aspects. Just 20 drops or so. It's not necessary though - just gives it a nice scent and I like to think it helps things along a bit. I probably do this about half the time.Still so much soap left and, well, I ran out of some all purpose spray. Made my own with a bit of Dr. Bronners to a 50/50 mix of water & vinegar. Works AMAZING. I now use Dr. Bronners for just about any cleaning that requires soap. If it's a tough job, I don't dilute it as much. If it's a light job, I dilute it a bit more. If it's something that won't be rinsed (all purpose spray), I dilute it significantly. (Tip on stuff that isn't going to be rinsed, use distilled water if you have really hard water. Otherwise you might feel a bit of film. I just boil some in my electric kettle and let it cool. Works fine.)Infinitely cheaper, over all, than the stuff you buy in the store. And, bonus: not as many chemicals. I'm not anti chemicals or store bought cleaners, but I've come to the conclusion that they don't work significantly better (if at all), they're more expensive, and they're not any more convenient. It takes all of a minute to fill an old spray/pump/squirt bottle with water, add some Bronners, maybe add some fragrance, and move on. One bottle to do almost all. Never going back.If you've never used Bronner's in this way, you can easily find loads of tips & suggestions on the Google. Lisa Bronner even has a blog and has posted a chart with dilution rates. And dilution isn't an exact science. You don't have to measure it all out. I just eyeball it.",2,2

The replacement soap cartridges for this dispenser are expensive (proprietary design) but there are a few YouTube Videos showing how to open these cartridges (running cover under very hot water and prying off with flat blade ""butter type"" knife) or you can refill using large basting syringe with brass tip fits into top of cartridge, just hold open silicon air release valve with toothpick careful not to pop into jar (if u do then u need to remove top with heat to retrieve and insert back into top otherwise will not function properly in dispenser) - anyway back to soap - I fill 10 oz jar w/ 1/3 Castile soap, 6 drops of vitamin ""E"" oil, 1 tablespoon of Almond oil, then use high quality essence scents - mix as u like (Lavender, Seet Orange, Rosemary, Tea Tree, etc.. some have natural germ killing properties) depending on essence I add 3 to 10 drops of each (2 to 3 scents mixed) - then fill the rest of the jar using DISTILLED water - approx. remaining 2/3 of the 10 oz capacity jar - then turn upside down, right-side up, several times until mixture is blended - you don't want to shake vigorously because you'll get too much foam inside jar, mix gently. I write down my ""formula"" on the jar with a sharpie because it is hidden under the Superhuman dispenser anyway and it reminds me what's inside the jar so if everyone likes it, I can repeat formula without having to memorize or look for a piece of paper somewhere. The sharpie washes off with some elbow grease and chemical cleaner if you want to change it later on.  This blend with the Almond and Vit ""E"" oils keeps skin smooth and soft especially for hands in harsh chemicals/detergents or greasy/dirty from yard work etc.. It cleans well, is gentle, and smells unbelievably good - you can alter scent essences for male or female preferred scents. Rosemary, Tea tree, and Orange or Lemongrass work well in ""Boys"" bathroom, while Lavender, Rosemary, is a good start for ""Girls"" - let the wife and kids pick their favorite scents - My Blend FOAMS Great with this Superhuman dispenser, some dispensers like less soap / more water, mine likes this 1/3 soap to 2/3 water ratio, I tried different ratios that didn't seem to foam properly (too loose or too firm) - Amazon sells everything needed- although local stores like ""Whole Foods"" have some all natural scents and oils for soap making as well. - I like the unscented Castile Soap because I like a blank slate - but you can get the pre-scented Castile and save $$$ and hassle of creating/blending  your own scents. - EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE.To fill cartridge using the syringe type baster (or if you pop top off instead) - the baster can also be used to clean the Simplehuman Dispenser using the included vinyl hose to connect to nipple inside the bottom of the dispenser, fill syringe with very hot tap water, turn dispense on and squeeze syringe to feed and flush out the dispenser as the internal plumbing does eventually get clogged and unit will not work correctly, and may not dispense foam (air venture gets clogged with soap) - just liquid soap - so this syringe has a dual purpose - it can be used to fill empty cartridges if u don't want to pop top off with very hot water to soften top - and it is perfect and fast to clean out internal plumbing, valves, venture etc.. - Operates like new after cleaning - about every 3rd refill - cleaning necessary. Here is link to syringe baster I use - from Amazon its only $8.89 (at present)-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFTYIMO/ref=sspa_dk_detail_5?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01HFTYIMO&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a54d13fc-b8a1-4ce8-b285-d77489a09cf6&pf_rd_r=NQ7837VHW3GX4J5TMAZY&pd_rd_wg=pQmPM&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&pd_rd_w=mhgJ0&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pd_rd_r=86e369e4-ab64-11e8-ab28-01ad97aa66bb",1,2

I don't have to worry about scary chemicals or bad reactions on her sensitive skin. She is three-years-old now and she still uses this soap. I use it as a body wash for her skin and a shampoo for her hair. A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last you a long time. It's baby mild, which is why I have purchased this particular kind ever since she was a newborn. She doesn't cry when this gets in her eyes, but it still hurts; then again, water hurts her eyes, so I can't say if this hurts more than water. It has a faint smell, but nothing fancy or putrid. It just smells clean. When she was a baby, this soap allowed her yummy baby head-smell to shine through rather than masking it with that baby shampoo smell (which is a nice smell but not as nice as natural baby head smell). My daughter's hair still looks as healthy as baby hair and I always feel as if it's because of using this soap her entire life instead of damaging it with chemical shampoo. I have noticed how different her hair shine and texture looks compared to the other little girls in her church class. She also gets lots of compliments on how beautiful and healthy her hair is. Her hair is also silky soft.  I buy castile soap in place of my own body wash and shampoo, but I choose the black soap variety for me. This one is perfect for children and babies. This soap works up a decent lather but it's not like regular shampoo that lathers well because of chemicals. This is a large 32 oz bottle and that size will last for quite a while and can be distributed in smaller bottles if you prefer. I distribute this into a small squirt bottle that I keep in the shower so my shower rack isn't stuffed full. I use this big bottle as a refill.This soap can be used for more than body wash or shampoo. You can use it to clean your house, do dishes, laundry, and all sorts of things. If you look up the uses for castile soap, you'll be surprised. I have also used this soap to fill up the soap dispenser in my bathroom for hand-washing. This soap is runnier than regular hand soap, but it dispenses perfectly and is better for your hands than hand soap. Also, it's not as drying to your skin. It's totally worth the price.",1,2

I add distilled or boiled water leaving enough room inside for the bulky dispenser top. I then add 2 tablespoons of Dr. Bronner's  liquid soap. 1/2 tsp. of almond, jojoba, olive, or argan oil (use your favorite). I also open a vitamin E oil capsule, then add a few drops of my favorite essential oils. During cold and flu season I will use thieves oils or lemon oil for their germ fighting properties. Then add the top, and gently shake to mix. Just make sure you add the water first or you will have a foamy mess! :)This soap is very nice and feels great on your skin.

The distilled white vinegar is optional, but it helps the soap rinse out completely, is a natural fabric softener, and no, your clothes don't come out smelling like vinegar, in fact, they don't come out smelling like anything at all, which is more ""unscented"" than any unscented (free of dyes and perfumes) product I ever used or tried.",2,2

I have been using it faithfully for the past 3 years or so. You can, literally, use it for anything. I use it as a body wash, an all--purpose cleaner, a floor cleaner, a dish soap, a laundry detergent, and a hand soap. For the laundry detergent I do mix it with washing soda, so I can't attest to how it does by itself. I do use it, however, for treating stains on my laundry, and I am always very impressed with it; I just have to make sure that I soak the stain as soon as possible. I did try out Branch Basics to evaluate the difference between it and Dr. Bronner's, and I just feel like Dr. Bronner's is such a better deal. To me, it seems far more concentrated, and it is sold at a much lower price. If you want to cut down on the amount of household cleaning products (especially those that are harmful) you are buying, then this is definitely your best bet. Look nowhere else. I usually buy mine from Vitacost if I am looking to get the gallon. It is usually a better deal.",2,2

It's what I continue to use.Started doing aromatherapy a little over a year ago. Took two online courses from a reputable aromatherapy institute--Natural Living and Butters & Balms. Make a lot of my own skincare products, including foaming hand soap. You fill an 8oz foaming soap bottle 2/3 full of distilled water and add: 2T of the Dr. Bronner's unscented Baby Castile soap, 1t fractionated coconut oil and 20 drops of essential oil.

You only need a tiny bit to suds up your pup. I have an Akita and a Jack Russell terrier. This is especially great for the Akita, he has a crazy thick coat. Usually I have to use almost a half bottle of dog shampoo on him to fully penetrate and suds up his coat.... but this stuff is like super-soap! Like I said, it suds up really well and removes all the oil, dirt, etc from your pup's coat. However, like any really strong soap, you gotta use a conditioner for your pet after you use this on their coat. I used apple cider vinegar and it complemented the soap nicely (the vinegar smell doesn't stay). Also, this soap doesn't have any strong smell so it's great if you live with someone who has fragrance sensitivities. This soap might seem expensive (I was reluctant at first) but it's lasted me a long time so far. I will definitely be buying this again.",2,2

I also like that it isn’t thick like normal body wash. The soap of course doesn’t have much of a smell which is a plus. I know some people use this as shampoo but I wouldn’t recommend that if you have textured hair. It just will make it kinda tangly and remove some of the necessary moisture of your hair. I still rate this 5 stars though because this is a soap and it does great as a soap!  I trust it on even dry skin areas which I try not to wash as much since they’re quite small and dry out quickly obviously. All in all, definitely will purchase again!",1,2

Sulfates do not get the dishes any cleaner, it is just what consumers have come to expect and is bad for the environment).

After having used this for more than 12 weeks now, I must say, I love the product. Unlike a number of products that brand themselves as organic, this one is true to it's label. Tell tale signs of a soap being organic are the following.No left overs. Highly water solvable and hence doesn't leave anything behind.Doesn't froth much. Just enough to wash the dirt out of your skin.No added fragrance.This ultra high concentrate is quite economical. I use hardly 8 drops (yeah drops) for my son who is 5 years old. This one is going to last quite a while. While this product can be used as a hair care product as well, some of us may not like it's hair cleansing powers or the lack of it. It doesn't alter anything and so may not give a shampoo wash after effect.",2,2

I purchased this because I just got starter Locs. I want to keep chemicals out of my hair. It works well and was recommended by a relative. I have the most sensitive skin ever. I know this will work well. I made a mistake while ordering, I wanted the baby powder scent. I ended up getting UNSCENTED. 😔Definitely not the seller’s fault. That was all me.",2,1

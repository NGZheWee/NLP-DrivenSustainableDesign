A bit overpriced for what they are, but every shop seemed to be out of stock on the island. Coffee must be had, thus they were ordered.Good quality.

Do not leak  !!! Recommend !

Brilliant for use with a single cup filter paper holder.

Unlike the other filter type, this one works flawlessly. I can make a full pot of coffee without any danger of an overflow.  Don't waste your money on anything else.

Double pack offer is good and filters work fine in my machine.

They work as always. Nothing special.

To make coffee the best way.

Excellent highly recommend

Ok

Do their usual good job

The box is crushed and unsanitary

I did not receive the Melitta 102 filters, I did however receive Melitta 1x4 filters with a sticker on saying that they're a replacement for the 102 filters. They are emphatically not a replacement. They're far larger and require considerable amounts of origami to get them to fit my machine.  I could have got purchased to 40 packs of these filters for just over half the price from Tesco.  Not sure I should blame the seller or the Amazon Dash Button for this, but I'm definitely not impressed.

Bad product

First order didn’t arrive, second order arrived next day but is the wrong type!Product itself is excellent.

The product quality is good. The box was delivered crushed, but the filters inside are fine. Amazon says this is a 2-Cup filter paper. However, the size is too big even for my 4 cup coffee maker. The 1X2 coffee filter fits it correctly. I have been buying 102 size for some time. Sometimes Amazon sends 1X2 size for 2-cup coffee filter, and this size is correct. But this time they sent 102 size, and this is too big.

I don't like this item not because of the quality but because of the design of this whole filtering method. Although it is for 2 cups, I would still suggest that you pour water into it several times. Why? It's just the speed that water flows through is not even. If you pour 2 cups of water inside all at once, you'll surely get coffee that is too watery, because the water flows through very very quickly. Yet when the water reaches the bottom, it flows too slowly. I have to honestly say that this design is not as smart as the Japanese drip bags made of paper. It costs an extra ceramic cup, is clumsy, but doesn't do the job perfectly.

After buying I realized the price was the same as in any random supermarket. Still ok.

Box was damaged when we got but still the filters were good.

Fits our 4-cup Phillips perfectly, don't have to trim the paper to size, and no overflow of powder.  The other brand we usually buy is a bit too large, and we have to snip off an inch off of the top of the filter.  But this is 25% more expensive than the other one.  Won't hesitate to buy again whenever the other one is not available.

Good

The product is the same as shown in the picture.

Package is delivered with damaged as photos while product is fine. This is a area to be improved as it is important to keep clean as it is not a washable product.

OK

They're not cheap - but to give them credit they don't fall apart and make good coffee.

Ok

The papers are of good quality, with a natural brown color, and they are free from any chemical residue. The size is perfect, and the brand name is well-regarded. Overall, everything seems great—these are awesome papers and definitely worth it.

Pricy but good quality

Useful

I have been buying these coffee filters for years and they have always been top quality.

I actually bought the wrong size but it turns out their smaller length means there is no danger of the top folding over. When the top falls  down it weakens the coffee.  I will continue to use them.

Glad it’s available on Amazon. Used to get it from Germany earlier. My machine is big but I use 1*2 as I don’t need more than two cups at a time. It has never folded or torn in my experience. Great product.

Perfect fit

Fits perfectly on my 12-cup coffee maker. Quality is fine, made in Germany, worth the money

Delivered quickly and item as described at a fair price. Will buy again

Great filters allow the release of the great aroma of my coffee and very easy to use.I use recently roasted beans ground at leve 8 on my grinder.I also use chemex which is great too and was my favourite quality up to now, but this matches it and I fully recommend it.

I use these on my small pour-over also from Melitta as well as in my small coffee maker. These work great, although I've had one or two of them split when they get wet. For the price there's nothing really to complain about and they do a flawless job of filtering the coffee.

Perfect size for my Philips senseo pod and cone filter machine as 102 or 3 is correct size. Good construction and design . Size 4 paper filters also fit this machine if bottom fold tucked in

I have a Melitta coffee machine which take these 102 filters. Not very available in UK shops, but easy to get on amazon! Just what I need!

Ideal way to make single cup of coffee (with the holder of course) have tried various cup and cafeterias and most are flawed in some way.  Just a simple filter and get excellent results everytime

The original aroma and test is kept with this filter.

Good value for the money. I like that it is not bleached paper.

Good fit for one cup drip. Same size as number 2 filter.

t hese are just perfect for my new melitta coffee machine and eco friendly.will stick with these.

This must be a joke.  The SMALLEST filters I have every seen showed up at my door - the pack is the size of a pack of playing cards.  I started laughing outloud 0-I have bought the exact same filters with the same labelling online and they bring you the ones that fit in an actual coffee machine or carafe. These seem to be about 1/2 the size of a 1 cup personal drip, not even big enough for that.  Not worth returning, but BE WARNED PLEASE.

I didn't see the size listed anywhere for these, I didn't even know that anyone made coffee filters this small. its like they were designed for mice

This product is not the same as showcased in the picture with the coffee machine. I have the exact same machine at home and they dont even reach half way to the top. Extremely small coffee filters.

These were tiny. Very annoyed about the waste of time and money. The size should be made far clearer. Even going back now, only the comments give any clue...and why would you read the reviews for a product you think you already know.

LORT Count of the number times we had to rinse the filters with boiled water before any papery flavor and taste were gone. Usually with white paper filters it's only a couple of times.Unfortunately,  they've now added these aroma pur holes which let in cafestol & kahweol coffee oils.The whole point of choosing the paper filter method is to filter out this gunk these compounds. They might add extra flavor they might add a fraction of extra fiber for some people, but these harmful coffee oils Skyrocket your blood pressure and upset your insides. Stick with the bleached filters

Not what I thought i was ordering.These filters are a mini version of the normal size filters which i was expecting. No good for my machine.

Unusable

Too small to be of any use.

These are great if you have a doll house sized coffee machine but are too small for a normal sized one.  More expensive then the normal sized ones too. I had to re-order.

It’s very small useless for my machine yet bought via buy again link on Amazon. Will not buy this product on Amazon again

Bought these as the 1x2 is no longer available and the photo showed someone using it in a drip filter. Fills basically half the ceramic drip, basically just enough for the coffee grinds. Genuinely don’t know what anyone could use these for

According to Melitta's website this is the next size down from 1 x 4 , there being no 1 x 2 any more. Which is why elsewhere the prices for the 1 x 2 have increased.This thing belongs to a dolly's coffee set rather than used in a 1 x 2 filter holder.

Amazon to blame for this one - I searched for size 4 filter papers and this came up as the 1st option, so I didn't really bother to check the sizes properly.They are NOT size 4 filters! They're tiny. It's also not really made clear anywhere in the description.Waste of time and money unless you have a machine that takes these tiny papers!

Don't be fooled by the big coffee machine picture in the third picture. Just small, cup-sized paper strainers.

They are VERY small, no use for my filter machine unfortunately.

The description of the product is very bad. There is no size and the it did not work for n my coffee maker.

This is the third time I give a chance and at least 30% is the filters come with a hole

not what i expected...these are tiny filters

I've been using the Melitta Coffee Filters 100/40 Natural Brown for a few weeks now, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with their performance. One of the standout features is how they fit perfectly in my coffee maker, ensuring a smooth brewing process every time.

These are very tiny. I have a one cup coffee flask with a tiny conical sieve, my other filters seemed to big for it so I ordered these. However it's very hard to pour the boiling water in without the tiny filter overflowing, so you have to pour very slowly, in stages... a bit tedious and you end up with lukewarm coffee! So... back to the bigger filters for me because the sides are higher and so they hold the coffee better and let you pour faster.

I hadn't realised when I ordered them how small they were.  Nothing wrong with the quality but very tiny.

Good filters, but small. Ordered for a MoccaMaster Cup One, that's a Nr. 1 filter machine. It works, but very little room for errors. The Technivorm (Original MoccaMaster) Nr. 1 filters are a little bit bigger.

Because item is Melitta product, I gave it 4 star. Item was too small for me but quality is still there.

Perfect for the Aromaboy! I only wish there were more in the box to make the packaging and shipping more worthwhile.Do exactly what you expect

A sample pack of five should be included with purchase of new coffee maker!

Do the job they are meant to do

Great value working very well.

ok

The media could not be loaded.
                



Perfect for the aromaboy, as the video shows, some people say it is a little too small, but the tolerance is less at smaller scale. If you grind too finely the water level will rise!

100% positive

quick service very good filters

Mini filter

Top

OK

Good products

Does the trick really, it's a good size for what I need for.Good value for money.

Is perfect

Our Moccamaster is designed for No4 papers, but these don’t reach the top of the cone and sometimes let water overflow when using the machine at full capacity.These bigger papers stick out above the cone — but rinse first and you can fold the edges down. Looks a bit odd but the lid still fits, and the water stays with the coffee.

Impeccable

Ok

Well looks good do not try yet

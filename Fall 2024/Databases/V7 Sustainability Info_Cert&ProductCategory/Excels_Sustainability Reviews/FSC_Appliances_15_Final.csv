The first time I used them to filter just a small amount of coffee grounds at less than boiling water temperature, the bag split immediately creating a huge mess. The same thing happened when I tried again with even less coffee coffee filtered even more slowly at even lower temperatures - the issue was clearly with the strength of the bag. The only way was able to keep to keep the coffee from splitting at creating a huge mess is by double filtering, which meant that the bags were used up twice as quickly. This not only makes the filters twice as expensive per filter as they advertise, but creates twice as much waste per cup of coffee, completely negating any l environmental benefit claimed by the company.

The first box's ""'never break' patented wave seam"" failed every time, allowing grounds to pass into my brewed coffee. Each time I thought that perhaps it was an anomaly and that the next filter would be fine. Nope. The first filter out of the second box failed similarly and, since then, I've been using two filters for each brew.

A few days ago the filter light went off, so we replaced the filter and carbon filter.  Within just moments of putting in this filter and the new carbon filter our room smelled like someone sprayed Black Flag fly spay all over our room!!! Arg!!! :(  We thought it was just the carbon filter, so we replaced that with one of the original Winix filters.  The horrid smell continued.  Then we read several reviews that mentioned the same thing.  We couldn't return the item since we had ordered it so long ago.  We unplugged the air purifier until Amazon Prime delivered the actual Winix brand replacement filter and carbon filters.

I had ordered a replacement online last time I needed one, and thought this was it, but it's a cheap knock-off.  The HEPA filter fits, but no idea if I can trust it.  The pre-filter has a plastic/chemical smell that comes out of the filter when you turn it on.  The dimensions are also slightly off on the pre-filter, I laid it over the original and it was about 1/4 inch shorter.  Will be returning it.  I now realize that I had gotten the legit replacement from Home Depot - if it's not in stock you can order it from their website.

They do come folded in fourths, so installation is a bit of a challenge due to the deep creases.  (It was easier to keep in place under the clips if the crease is on top.)  I tried to install the 3 main filters yesterday, but immediately noticed a heavy chemical smell upon removing each filter from the plastic bags.  After installation and turning the unit on, the smell was quite noticeable.  I took the filters outside and let them ""air out"" for several hours and then placed them in the garage overnight.  I just reinstalled them, and noticed the smell again upon turning the machine on.  I ran the turbo mode for several minutes, and the smell has now lessened, but still remains.  I do not know why they have an order.  I will try placing them outside again today for an additional ""airing"".  Is it the filter itself or from the plastic bag it came in?  Regardless, the smell is a concern (as others have mentioned) and although the price is reasonable, I most likely will not repurchase these in the future.",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

After buying ""the best"" and being hugely under impressed, I ordered the first Winix for less than a third of what ""the best"" cost. We have a resident cigar smoker here--so an underperforming purifier left me gasping and smelling like a tavern. What a difference! How I wish we'd started out with a Winix--or two! We were so impressed, I immediately ordered another for the other end of the room (where I sit). Of course, the filters have to be changed more often than those used in a non-smoking environment. Having two--their brand-name set would be pricey. This set comes with the paper (non-washable) filter and the charcoal prefilter--but not the original gauzy washable pre-pre-filter. When I smell smoke on the porch, I wash the pre-pre- and the pre--and we're back to fresh air. When the paper filter gets brown, time to order more. A tip here--save the charcoal pre-filter for when you wash the current pre-filter because you should not put in it back in wet. When you wash it the first time, a lot of charcoal dust goes down the drain--once it rinses without a tinge of black, it will smell like new. It would be fabulous if the paper filter were washable--but then I guess it wouldn't be a hepa filter. When I write reviews, I try to be honest about whether I would buy an item again if it quit working for whatever reason. I would purchase the Winix (the model with the remote--which will work on however many you have) and these discount filters.",-1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": -1, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

In the first section I share my initial impressions after experiencing a filter blow-out during a brew.  Not satisfied with that alone, the second section comes after I decided to try and re-create the failure.==========Originally titled: Not recommended for use with Flow Control/Prisma caps. [★★★☆☆]My go-to recipe for light roasts is a modified version of Jonathan Gagné's 10 minute brew, and that was exactly what I brewed first to test these filters. The nature of this recipe often produces a heavily settled coffee bed that needs a bit more pressure to get through the plunge phase.  That has never been a problem... until today.The 'hiss' came early.  Too early, and with too little resistance behind it.  I backed off and looked down to see I had only made it through about 2/3 of the brew chamber.  Pressing again, more hiss.  Truly a first for my.  I shrugged and went about my typical clean-up, but had pause for concern when I removed the cap and noticed the filter not looking quite right.  Took it to the sink, rinsed it off, and found a hole bored clean through it.As I write these thoughts on this, the last day of March 2024, I find myself wondering if I need to go panic-buy a few boxes of branded AeroPress filters, as they are scheduled to raise the price, quite literally, tomorrow.For those of you using the standard cap, these are probably fine.  My calipers read 0.005"", same as the branded filters.  Held to the light, these even seem to be of a more consistent thickness and tighter ""weave"" than the official filter.==========It was at this point in the first draft of this review that I decided to try and reproduce the blow-out without any coffee.  Immediately upon filling the chamber with water I noticed strange white markings in the installed filter.  I held the next filter in line up to the light and noticed nothing out of the ordinary, but the instant I placed it into a glass of water, sure enough, more white markings appeared.  I repeated this process for approximately 12 more filters before the markings finally stopped showing up.  By this point I had also noticed something of a film that had begun to develop in the glass of water I was testing with.  This debris was also present in the coffee mug I had been testing filter blow-out in.  Strange, to say the very least.After testing a few more of the filters I decided to take random samples from throughout the remaining filters, still in the box.  Of the 15ish samples taken, I only found one sample that contained these white markings, and filters on either side of it's location in the stack also had them.At this point, I'm not willing to put these thing anywhere near something I'm going to drink, and I am thankful all of this came about with my first attempt at using them, and not some 200 cups in or something.  It could very well be a big ol' nothingburger, but I'll leave that to folks more brave than I to figure out.",1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": -1, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

They are also in a very thin plastic wrap that makes them flop around so they are harder to store upright without wedging them between something.In comparison, these are pre-folded and come in a cardboard box that makes them much more manageable, with a lid to help keep ants and etc out of them.I never could find official Chemex filters for a reasonable price, I get the impression they are much thicker and provide a cleaner cup of coffee than these filters, so if your after something to give you Chemex-grade filtering these probably won't fit your needs. These are almost identical in thickness and texture to my cone filters for smaller pour-over systems, just lager so they can fit a Chemex. If your not a fan of Chemex's signature taste and want something more typical though, these should be fine for that. I always rinse my filters, and didnt taste anything unusual in my coffee compared to my other filters.Personally, the form factor and the box make these a good product for -me- and I'm happy with them, though the price is a little high for only 50 filters at about $7.99.

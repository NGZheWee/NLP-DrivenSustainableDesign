My key functions requires are scanning and printing.  Not a high page volume, but good print quality is important.I do not connect my printers via wifi, I have found that regardless of who makes the printers, a wifi connection is not reliable.  I unboxed the printer, followed all instructions, and hooked the printer up to my computer directly via USB port.  Now on any other printer I have set up, that type of connection is very simple and reliable.The printer did print for me from my computer, but it seems to take a lot of time to warm up and print a page.  Not like 10 seconds, more time than that.  Like when you hit print then wait.....and wait....and wait.....then start wondering ""did I not finish submitting the print job?""  Then you go back, hit print again, then right when you hit print the first job finally starts.  That would be annoying in time.I found the desktop app which is similar to the app I had with my old HP.  I tried to scan and for some reason, the app cant find my printer.  Everything I tried, no luck being able to have my computer and printer communicate to scan.  How can it print but not scan?  I tried the printer controls, incredibly vague and seems to want to scan to email.  What about scanning to a computer?  Its like Kyocera felt that was not important.  Scan to a thumb drive, sure thats there.  But what about my computer?  I am not a spy, I want to scan to my computer.The instructions are a joke.  They only cover 5-6 steps on the install and provide one line of instructions per step.  Then have that translated to 10 different languages so its hard to find anything helpful.  I tried going online, again nothing.I am returning the device and getting something different.  I bet the printer works fine and it requires a technician to install it so it works.  That is kind of ridiculous for no networking being involved.  Even if I bite the bullet and pay the $150 to have a tech come out and install it, what happens when I get another computer?  Another $150?  This is not a device that is easy to set up.  If you have your own IT department, ok it may be fine.

Should have researched more, because it'll cost a lot more in the long run for toner. These need a special chip on the cartridge or the printer freaks out, and if you don't turn off the cartridge ""anti-theft"" option before installing one it locks it to that specific printer. If the printer breaks with a full cartridge, you pretty much just have to throw the cartridge away. From everything I can tell, that's the only difference between this and the 402s, meaning hp introduced a new line and discontinued the old one just to try and force people into buying their massively overpriced cartridges instead of third party ones. Also, the printer freezes up when trying to print envelopes about 80% of the time.

They have their defaults that will tie you up for a half hour before you accomplish (use the term in its loosest way) anything.  It’s working to, I have had to abort every call then 24 hours later I get an email case closed- resolved. Must be nice.the printer is large, and the print quality is good.  Don’t get me started on the chipped cartridges.  Reading that HP wants to ensure its customers only the best quality output and running counterfeit cartridges could lower their satisfaction with HP products is as orwellianly backwards.  I don’t work for a fortune 1000 company - who can afford HP Toner but those that get huge discounts because of the amount of installed units.I have owned the printer for a year and have had constant problems.

There are multiple problems, some of which are systemwide for HP and some of which appear to be that I got a lemon. Lemon Problems: 1) It cycles through sleep/wake up like every minute. I actually timed it once. It goes into sleep mode at 10:19 am, wakes up before 10:20, whirs and clicks for about a minute, then turns off again...then right back on less than a minute later. It was crazy making! I have to turn the machine off when I'm not trying to print or it drives me crazy. So, every time I need to print or scan anything, I have to turn the machine on and wait for it to warm up. PITA! 2)Today, I came into my office (at home because pandemic) and had to print something first thing before settling down to work on a deadline. Printer won't print! I can see the job in the job queue on my computer, I can see the printer view screen responding to the information being sent, but the printer never prints anything. I've tried changing to a different network (I have several), I tried turning it off and turning it on again, I tried changing to direct print. Nothing. Then, in the midst of this, I get a blue screen with an error code. That was the last straw for me. My IT person told me he thought the sleep/wake issue was a sign of a lemon and I should return. So, today, I came here to log a return, only to find out the return window is one month and it's over. So, my only option is tech support and HP has me on hold rn. They told me that *if* they determine replacing the machine is the thing to do, it will be replaced with a refurbished machine, not a new one. That is utter bu11sh1t. I'm pissed. I run a non-profit. We aren't made of money. We had a grant that covered this. Giving us a used printer when this is 100% an HP-cause problem is unacceptable. NOW, for the HP-system wide problem. If you use a MAC, you will not be able to scan to email. In fact, it sounds like no one can scan to email because everyone in the world has updated their security protocols EXCEPT HP. So, there is that. You will have to scan to thumb drive and then plug that in to your ocmputer and then move the files over. Who has time for that?!

It came off fairly easily but did rip in half and get pretty crumpled up which I thought was odd.I proceeded to set up the printer and test everything but when I tried the copier with a page fed through the top tray, everything jammed up.  It's at this point after googling for answers my brain finally registered the ""red circle with a slash"" over the piece of flimsy plastic covering the scanner surface.  I felt pretty stupid until I looked at the comments online and realized MANY people make the same mistake.  Seriously HP... you shower the printer with all kinds of little pieces of plastic protective film and this looks no different, but you highlight this particular piece and actually have a diagram of a hand pulling it off.  I know I should have properly registered the fact that there was a ""circle and slash"" over it, but clearly I'm not alone in misinterpreting this!  How about WORDS that say DO NOT REMOVE!I tried going to HP support and it simply does not work.  I can't log in, register the product or an account, etc.  It's been one hell of a frustrating day with HP!!!  Can someone here tell me how I can get a replacement piece of cheap plastic for the copy scanner head / feeder???  This piece TOTALLY looks like an afterthought fix for something that clearly wasn't working properly.  Who lightly glues a piece of cheap plastic film as a mandatory component to the outside of a very expen$ive printer?!?!?!?

Hughes,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023",1,"This HP Pro MFP M479fdw prints fine until you need to buy a set of replacement ink / toner cartridges which cost nearly as much as a brand-new machine. Then the HP Pro MFP M479fdw becomes nothing more than a paperweight.HP places chips in their ink / toner cartridges and requires you to only use their refills. The problem is that their refills are incredibly expensive, and no better than non-OEM cartridges.There is no way to disable this feature from the firmware, so once you buy the HP printer, you are forced for the life of the machine to pay whatever HP decides to charge. You have no right to repair or replace the HP ink or toner cartridges at all.This printer now costs me more to own and operate than any other laser jet on the market, and I will never again buy an HP-- personally or professionally.

Tech support rarely answers phone.  Finally got a tech support person - in some South American Country.  He was at home with a noisy child in the room and was so distracted that I had to remind him I was still there and was watiing for his next instruction.  He had no interest in the product, HP, or my case.  When I asked him a question, he seemed startled that I was still there and eventually got irritated with me, even though I was the one who blew 1000.00 on a defective printer.  After 4 hours, he basically gave up and said he would have another department look at it.  I asked for the number of the department and he said there is no way to get in touch with them.

It arrived completely useless with a defective fuser. HP tech support agreed. We were able to return it to Amazon, and then we purchased the M479. At first, everything seemed fine with the new printer. I tried to order the optional 3rd paper tray. It arrived, but it would throw a jamming error any time it tried to grab a piece of paper. Again, HP determined that it was a defective unit and it was replaced. The second one has been fine. Now, flash forward to a month or two later:The M479 comes installed with some cheap introductory toner cartridges with limited capacity. I expected that these wouldn't last too long, but we also don't print anything with color in the office. The printer eventually told me they were empty, so we purchased a full set of high-capacity color cartridges (which cost approximately $600). When I installed these brand new genuine HP cartridges, the printer recognized them as having the same capacity as the introductory cartridges (I think it's only like 150-200 pages?). In fact, the embedded web server showed that new introductory cartridges were installed and that they were not the high-capacity version. Weird. I figured it wasn't a big deal, because if the cartridges have toner in them, then we'll still be able to print color. It shouldn't matter what the display says, right?Wrong. About a month later, after barely printing any color pages, the printer again told me that the cartridges were empty. They were not. They were still heavy and obviously full of toner. So again, I contact HP. After hours of troubleshooting and trying various methods to reset the printer, they determined that it was a defective unit and acknowledged that something was very wrong. We were also out of warranty. At this point, the color cartridges had begun to seize and squeak. Even though they were still full, the printer was telling these cartridges to act like they were empty (hence the squeaking and seizing, the grinding, the constant messages telling us that the cartridges are empty). It's important to mention that these noises from the seizing and leaking cartridges are still audible when you're only printing in black and white.So after purchasing 4 separate pieces of hardware from HP, 3 of them were delivered as defective. We purchased $600 worth of color toner and were told ""sorry"" when the printer refused to acknowledge which cartridges were actually installed. We've also seen multiple error messages which indicate a fuser motor defect. This printer is now two years old and has printed 60,000 pages. Sure, it still prints in black and white, but the noises are unbearable. I'm talking about a solid 80-90 decibel screech. You can't even talk on the phone if someone is printing something. HP's suggestion was to replace the color toner cartridges, because they make noise when they run out! Great, so the noises will go away for another month or two at a cost of $600 and then you'll tell us to replace them again when the printer decides they're empty? It is now essentially useless to us and we wasted more money on toner than it cost to buy the entire thing in the first place. We're replacing it with a Brother. I will never purchase hardware from HP again.I'm giving this 2 stars because the scanning/copying features have been fine and have never failed us.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

Then I saw the newer M479fdw was on sale for $398, only $50 more and decided it to buy it, since it was to be a newer better model and with 2-sided scanning. But after using both models for the past week, I can say that the M281fdw is the better built unit, while the M479fdw has some issues.First off, the M479 has a very loud cooling fan that always stays on while the unit is on (even when not printing). The only way to stop the fan is to have the unit set to go into Sleep Mode after 10 minutes of non-use. When printing, there is also a noticeable high-voltage electrical sound coming from the vents on the right side. This is the only laser printer that I've ever heard this type of sound from, and it just sounds like there's an electrical problem. The M281 model doesn't have a loud cooling fan that stays on all the time (in fact, I'm not sure if it has a fan) and there is no high-voltage transformer buzzing when it prints.Regarding the actual printing, for Black Text and basic color documents, both M479 and M281 are identical. But when it comes to printing a color picture, the M281 produces better looking and more realistic colors, while the M479 colors are more dull/faded and don't match the original picture. I made sure both printers are using the same color settings and have the newest Firmware and Drivers installed. But no matter what I try, the color pictures from the M479 don't look as good as from the M281.Lastly, for copying Black Text, both models are the same, with the advantage of 2-sided scanning on the M479. But for color copying, the M479 looks terrible. I tried to copy a few pictures (that where original film-to-paper prints or from an inkjet) and the color copies on the M479 look way off. But on the M281 the color copies are much closer to the original.That being said, the M479 is Made in Mexico and the M281 is made in Vietnam, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.Overall, I wish the M479fdw worked as well for colors as the M281fdw, as I like the 2-sided scanning and the larger LCD Display. But the loud cooling fan and high-voltage electrical buzzing on the M479 are a deal-breaker for me. Between the two, I just like the M281fdw more, it prints better colors, is a quieter and smaller unit, and feels better made.",-1,-1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": -1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": -1}"

I had read some thoughtful reviews that reported difficulties with setup. So I was fully prepared to run into a wall at some point in the process.I followed the instructions about unboxing (in other words turning the box in its side), and removing the tape from various places. I opened up various covers to make sure I wasn’t missing any tape hidden inside. There was none. I inserted paper and plugged it in.It powered up quickly. The touch screen menu is excellent. It is colorful, uncomplicated, and it responds quickly to the touch, like a smartphone.I downloaded the software onto my computer from the hp website and, though it took a bit of time, the software installed perfectly. It recognized the printer and installed itself for wireless printing on my laptop. There was literally nothing else to do. Windows 10 seamlessly recognized the printer and I printed a test page with no problem.I downloaded the hp app onto my iPhone and was able to print a test document without any problem. That was really cool because none of my other computers were ever able to do that.I went to a different part of the house and was able to connect my wife’s Mac to the printer as well, simply by searching for it and adding it.The test pages I printed were laser perfect, as expected. They printed after a few seconds, there was no long wait.When idle, the printer enters power saving mode after about a minute. It goes completely silent and dark except for the power light. At first I thought there may be a problem, but no. It wakes instantly when called back into service.I did not try to set up the fax function (does anyone still use that?), so I can’t comment on how that would have gone. Nor did I try to scan or copy anything.As I said, this is a preliminary review. I will update it as I become more familiar with its features, like scanning and copying, and how it works over the long haul.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Hawks,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024",2,"I started in IT before laser printers were invented and before HP even made printers. When they came out with their initial laser printers, they were the workhorses of the industry and their printers were built like their calculators - tanks. But even then, there were always driver and/or functionality issues. Later in life, after HP had somehow established itself as the defacto standard in laser printers, I headed up a large IT department and HP somehow always convinced us to go with their products. My support team certainly had way more than their share of help desk triage calls to go deal with dysfunctional HP printers. You'd think I'd have learned over the years to avoid these continuously worsening pieces of technological disasters, but no... I have made the mistake several times of purchasing and installing HP printers in my home & office.Now having owned and attempted to regularly use a Color Laserjet MFP M479fdw AIO for a couple of years, it has become my proverbial last straw with HP printers, and most likely ANYTHING HP. This printer has always/continuously had some sort of issue, since day one. These days, it stops working not daily, but literally hourly or less. It is constantly going offline, printing errantly if online, and/or suddenly out of nowhere waking up and printing a document you gave up on hours or days prior, even if you deleted it out of the source's print queue. These machines come haunted from the factory. And the drivers/files are HUGE 470MB just for the printer driver alone on a Mac. IIRC, larger on my Windows PC. It's got a scanner, so add another 190MB for that too - and that's just the install file size. Once it's done installing, it actually takes up far MORE space on your drive.Oh, and HP's replacement cartridge strategy of: when it runs out of toner, we're going to charge you so much to replace the cartridges that you can literally buy a new printer for less, so go do that - is completely unacceptable (which I have fallen for a few times with HP color lasers - what a ridiculously wasteful and environmentally disrespectful approach to printing - SHAME ON YOU HP!) And several times, when we've purchased new HP cartridges, taken them out of the original HP boxes and installed them into this printer, it throws an error stating that the cartridges aren't HP OEM and it will not use them/print at all.Oh, and no Internet connection? Then no printing. It doesn't matter if you elect to go with their online account, or print drivers or print controlling or not, the printer still insists on having an active Internet connection (what kind of data are HP collecting without our knowledge??) before becoming functional.After 40+ years, I'm finally done. I have raged, complained, and dealt with their worst-on-the-planet (lack of) customer service, etc. for the last time. If you call them, they will tell you they cannot help you, and then attempt to upsell you on something, like support or an extended warranty - even if the product you're calling on IS still under warranty. Absurd!Ironically, I still have and love (even though I hardly ever use them anymore) my old engineering, finance, and computer programming HP calculators, and they are still phenomenal. What happened to those days and that company??If you are considering this (or any) HP printer, do yourself a favor and stop the possibility of being driven insane by a device that will work intermittently at best, have drivers that are always a royal pain to install and use (AND don't work/install most of the time), and buy a brand other than HP. What once, long, LONG ago was a halfway decent printing solution company has turned into a money grabbing, unreliable, torture device manufacturer with no support. PLEASE don't do it. You'll be kicking yourself and regretting it (like me) if you do.",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

This printer is in my home with 2 other family members, we have light printing needs, and after 6 months I'm on my 3rd set of cartridges (to replace all 4 are about $500).  The published yield on the 3 colored HP factory cartridges are 2100 pages - the black cartridge is 2400 pages.  Because their printer does not have page counts or any way to actually look at printer use, anecdotally I can promise there is no way I've come anywhere close to printing 1000 pages total - and I'm now on my 3rd set!!!!

Does not wake up for maintenance. - Supports a lot of protocols for printing to the printer (IPP/IPPS, AirPrint, some stuff through HP apps, Google Cloud Print, LDP, and a few more). - Thankfully allows for moderately complex setup of networking (can change hostname, configure/manage IPv4 and IPv6 networking, NTP time sync, etc.). - Wireless connectivity works as advertised. Did not try printing with a direct wireless connection, Bluetooth, or Ethernet (although options for managing all of those exist in the administration pages). - Printing works as expected. Seeing that this is my first laser printer, it is significantly faster than any inkjet I've printed. It doesn't take particularly long to warm up. Color printing of photos works well, although they seem a bit dark compared to a calibrated display (could also be the lighting in the rooms I was looking at wasn't the brightest). Details are sharp, and I'm honestly surprised at the quality. I'm not seeing any artifacting, really. I would still print photos with some other device (say, at Walmart or CVS or Walgreens using a dedicated photo kiosk) to conserve color toner (plus it'll likely be better), but this printer looks to be good for general purpose color printing.The meh: - Support was prompt, but had me follow a pretty basic script to diagnose issues with the scanner. They were unable to fix my issues, and told me to get a replacement unit from Amazon, which I did. The fact that I had to get a new unit was an annoyance, and looking at all of the forums online, it looks like ADF issues with HP printers are very frequent. Either HP sells way more printers than everyone else combined, or HP has a quality control issue when it comes to ADFs. - Installation software for Windows is slow and sluggish (and hung once for me). I expect some of that is downloading a whole swath of archives, but it also hung for about 20 minutes trying to set up faxing (I think, the UI was glitching) even though I didn't need to set that up. The second time I went through the setup the software didn't hang, although sometimes it looked like it did. It went much faster.The bad: - Bug in the web server: if the password for the email account one is going to use to send notifications has an ampersand (&) in it, the web server or whatever service the printer has escapes ""&"" to ""& amp"" (without the space, Amazon seems to be filtering out the & HTML code) (e.g. ""abc&123"" becomes ""abc& amp123""), which obviously causes SMTP authentication to fail. Since the internal software for the printer is closed source, there is nothing I could do to fix that. This is something that HP will have to address. - For my original printer, ADF scanning was tilted/skewed, which seems to be a common problem. Seeing that I specifically bought this printer for its ADF (otherwise I would have picked a Brother with better reviews for a color laser printer), this was a deal breaker for me. I followed instructions from HP support to clean the (brand new) ADF sheet feeder rollers, and to adjust the paper binders of the ADF, to no avail. They told me to send the printer back for a replacement, which I received. The very first thing I tested was the ADF alignment, since if that was bad I was just going to request a full refund and just buy a printer from a different manufacturer. Lucky for HP (for now), this ADF seems to work better.- This second printer developed a squeak when feeding paper through the system. HP support thinks is the toner/drum, but I tested removing one at a time to no avail, and the drum is very securely held in the system so I did not remove it (requires removing parts of the casing and unscrewing some elements and manually disconnecting a bunch of small wires). HP support did send a technician to look at it, and they replaced the power board, which changed the squeaking/chirping noise slightly, but it was still there. The first printer did not have this. In the end, I returned the second printer to Amazon for a refund. -- I did notice something about the ADF which seems like a design flaw, and might be the cause of all of the mis-alignment complaints that plague a lot of HP ADFs. Well, really two things, but related: 1. There is only one motorized wheel in the middle of the ADF to move papers through the ADF for scanning, and 2. it seems like this roller sticks out a tiny amount from where the paper rests in the ADF, so if the paper guides aren't set properly, the paper, once pushed into the ADF securely, will most likely lean to one side or another, likely leading to the skew or tilt I saw with the other printer. The paper guides must be set pretty much perfectly (tall order) to prevent this skew. I noticed this with my current printer, but I took a lot more care to make sure the paper guides were pretty much perfect to prevent the paper from tilting inside the ADF. The way to do this (or at least how I did it) is to take a stack of papers, place the papers on the ADF but don't push them all the way in (so the stack doesn't swivel around the wheel), make sure they stay as much as in a stack as possible, and now adjust the paper guides around this stack (the way I did this was over-adjusting the guides so the papers bent a little, then holding the guides with one hand and pushing the paper flat with the other slowly, so that the guides were slowly pushed to the perfect size). So long as nothing touches the guides after this adjustment (and one doesn't get a defective ADF), there should be next to no tilt or skew.I've taken a few pictures of the print quality report the printer took. The first picture is one of both the original (on the left), and the copied one, read in from the ADF. Notice the lack of a skew. The second picture is a closeup of the original quality report, and the third picture is the copy of the quality report as scanned through the ADF. One thing to note with the third image is  that it seems that with solid colors, the scan produced some line patterns. Since I haven't played enough with the scanner yet, I don't know if this is a limitation of the scanner, the result of some pre/post-processing to ""clean-up"" the image, or just the quality of the scanner. Looking at the quality of the printer, it's not the printer part that's producing those artifacts.Overall: If you get a printer with a decent ADF, it seems to be a good color laser printer for its price. Some units tend to have a bad ADF, and even with a good printer it looks like the ADF has a design flaw that makes it difficult to line up the pages, but it can be made to work. Printer works as expected and I am pleased at how fast it is, and the web administration is pretty nice. I'm taking one star away for the password bug I mentioned and how finicky the ADF can be, and another for HP's bad QA, otherwise this looks like a capable printer. I would like to see HP design a better ADF for future models, though. I'm sure some people will like the printer, but I just don't want to deal with the possibility of getting another bad one, so I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1,0,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": -1, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 0, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Since I didn't, warranty is void and they won't help me.-- PSA watch your new printer purchases.  I bought one that **HAD** to be registered to work, **HAD** to be registered ONLINE, and the registration server was down for 3 days.

And HP has been in the forefront of development of laser printing technology, with literally dozens of models for home/business applications.  This model is a good example of their desktop line of lasers.  Remarkably svelte for what it does (although it does weigh over 50 pounds) - ten years ago this type of printer would have been on wheels, with it's own room and IT staff.  And it does everything - automatic duplex printing, scanning and copying, fax with a phone bypass, 28 ppm output, monochrome or full color (and HP has some of the best color profiles in the business), multiple paper weights (HP has a full line of light and heavy weight plain and photo laser papers), finishes and input options (accessories available for tray expansion up to 550 sheets) - truly business-friendly.  It's a do-everything laser printer.  Setup was relatively easy (more below), the built-in LED screen is fast and intuitive, with a galaxy of setup/input options), and it's fairly quiet for a laser.  Monochrome text is crisp and high resolution, and even larger (8x10) photos print at an acceptable 600x600 dpi with perfect color matching.  Not bad.It's also economical, in spite of the Bentley cost of laser toner cartridges - standard replacements are north of $100 each, and a full set (4) of high-yield cartridges will set you back, shipping and tax, on the near side of $1,000 - the standard toner cartridges are good for over 2,000 pages, and high-yield around 6,000.  As a comparison, a standard business inkjet cartridge ($40) will yield 300-400 pages realistically, between clearing dry cartridges and cleaning printer heads, for a best cost of about .10 per page (it can get worse, because you may need to toss out cartridges that have dried out and are unusable - if you print full color brochures or photos with your inkjet infrequently you may pay over .25 per page).  A high yield toner cartridge ($230+) will yield 6,000 pages, for a best cost of .04 per page (standard cartridges will cost per page about the same).  For high volume business printing, your finance department will tell you it's a no-brainer.  For home use, toner cartridges are pricey, but will require no maintenance, can be left in the printer unused for weeks and will still print perfectly, and will yield the full rated number of pages.  The only thing a laser won't do compared to an inkjet is print large format, high resolution photos on graphic arts photo paper - for this you need a dedicated inkjet, warts and all.As far as the setup mentioned above, my first printer arrived DOA - two screens into the setup the onboard LED read ""Printer Failure.""  HP online support seemed to be under the impression I had a different printer, and continually provided instructions that didn't apply to this printer, so ultimately we declared the printer bricked.  Amazon shipped out a new printer ASAP, which went through the setup perfectly.  Could be shipping - HP laser printers don't like their innards shaken- or could be a manufacturing defect.  Stuff happens.  I should also mention that HP printer construction is not quite as robust as some rivals - thinner plastic and hinges, more movable bits - but overall fine for light business or home use, and does come with onsite support from HP for a time.  If you're a small business, this printer does everything you need, economically, with HP's expansive universal support network available.  If you're currently a home user with an inkjet on your desk, you might take a longer look at this one if you're thinking of the switch to lasers - long-term, it will serve you as well, with less fiddling and maintenance, and even though supplies are costlier on the front end, it really is no more expensive and likely even cheaper for general printing needs, with faster and better output.

I purchased this printer two years ago and have been very satisfied with it.  The quality, speed, and ease of use has been very good.  The toner cartridges that came with the new printer lasted almost two years but I made the mistake of purchasing after-market replacement cartridges and they didn't work in my printer, so be careful when purchasing replacement toner cartridges for this printer.  It sounds like an endorsement for HP, but I recommend using only HP toner cartridges.  The reason is because some of the brand ""x"" cartridges(like the ones I bought), don't come with the computer chip necessary to be compatible with this HP printer.The cheap toner cartridges I bought came with instructions on how to remove the computer chip from the empty HP cartridge and insert it into the replacement cartridge.  Easier said then done.  The chips in the HP cartridges were glued in place, and no amount of cutting, or pulling, or pushing would get them out.  I tried removing the chip out of one of the old cartridges and ended up destroying the cartridge, and was still unable to remove the chip that was essentially ""welded"" to the plastic.  I know that paying $120 for each HP replacement cartridge is a lot to swallow($455 if you buy all 4 at the same time like I did), but I think it's the only way to get a compatible toner cartridge.  If you can find a replacement cartridge that has the computer chips built-in then good for you, but I didn't have any luck with that.",0,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": -1, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

So far it prints perfectly.  The ADF works fine, including the rare feature of 2-sided scanning without having to flip the page mechanically.  After a bit of a false start, I found that I can manage (and selectively disable) its many options nicely through the web interface. I love that is has features like being able to force it to use only black toner even when receiving color jobs, and that can even be done per user (if you're using authN). We have Macs, iPads, Windows 10, and  Windows 8 systems here. The only one that gave any difficulty with setup was the Win8 and it's flaky anyway.  I appreciate how quickly it starts, prints, and then shuts down -- much quieter than the old printer.CONS: The flatbed scanner works great for single sheets on it, but it's designed horribly for scanning from bound books. It looks like it should work, but cuts off more than an inch from the edge, making it useless.  The little touch screen app is not designed well. Even with small fingers and careful use, it's too easy to hit the wrong thing in some places. It's sufficiently functional but could work better.  If you know anything about how to configure networks and devices, you're better off NOT using the terrible HP app for ""easy setup"".  Like most cheapskate companies these days, its toner cartridges are INSANELY OVERPRICED, and it comes with crappy half-empty ones. But I'm hoping that the fact the cartridges include the drum units will help avoid some of the long-term maintenance problems I had with Brother (see below).Background:I recently bought this to replace the color Brother MFC-9840CDW I suffered with for years. Those Brothers have a great ADF but many serious design flaws in the print mechanisms, the worst being defective (real OEM) toner cartridges that spew toner throughout the machine, even when brand new.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

It was fairly easy to set up the software on the primary PC and then to connect wirelessly with the other laptops. I was able to run bulletins for a church service using the booklet mode and duplex the pages while flipping on the short side. The colors were accurate and the black and white was crisp. I had no wrinkled pages and the duplex project completed rather rapidly. The Printer self cleans during sizable print jobs preventing ink smear and dirty copies. There were a few moments when I was concerned during the setup but these problems seemed to resolve fairly rapidly without me having to struggle. The one feature I had trouble with at first was scanning. This was, however, my issue and not the machine's issue. Once I figured it out, and it wasn't really that challenging.  The first scan was slightly tilted but then again, once I used extra care in placing the document, this didn't happen again. The color scan was even better to view on the monitor screen than in the original. I posted a picture of the scan. It was hard to capture but you can see that the screen image is brighter and clearer than the original. In the photo, the original appears darker than it actually was but the difference is still marked.

This printer is not cheap; however, it is already starting to pay itself off on reduced inkjet costs.  Full review below!Setup:The printer was very easy to set up for computers and from phones/tablets.  The HP Smart App was very user friendly and I experienced no issues getting it set up in just a few minutes.Speed:The printer is extremely fast at warming up and printing.  It is at least twice as fast as the inkjet I was using that was only a few years old.  Two sided printing for less paper use is very speedy as well.Print Quality:The printer has a variety of print quality settings, none of which you will use regularly.  The standard setting is fantastic for office level print quality.  For the occasional picture or flyer, it does a fantastic job on the print quality.Scanning:Openly admit that one of the features I had to have was 2 sided scanning.  Why have a printer that can print on two sides if you can't scan on both sides!?  This has just helped cut my paper consumption considerably.Toner:Toner lasts much much longer than any inkjet cartridge.  This is such a benefit to the environment if you look at your waste stream per page.  The toners from my purchase are still going strong after 428 sheets.  I was going through an XL HP 62 cartridge every week prior to this purchase.",1,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

This replaces an old inkjet printer and there is absolutely no comparison.  Making the change to a laser printer was well worth the investment.The colors are vivid, crisp, and clear.  And, purple actually prints PURPLE!  I compare this to the inkjet and laser printers I use at work.  Purple prints as a weird bluish-purple.  It has an automatic sleep mode.  And, it's very quiet when it prints.  So much so that there have been times I sat there waiting for it to print, only to realize it already did!You can copy and scan with this machine as well.  Both features are very easy to use.  A very convenient feature is the USB port on the front of the printer.  This allows you to (1) print documents off a flash drive and (2) save scanned documents onto the flash drive.  There also a fax feature, but I haven't used it.While this is not deemed a photo printer, I did use it to make my 2019 Christmas cards on cover stock paper (which a little thinner than card stock).  No problems printing on the thicker paper.  And, the photos printed completely to my satisfaction.I would definitely buy this again.",2,2,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": 1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

I went ahead and bought replacements cartridges online, to have them whenever mine would be empty. That day has come and today, in need of printing documents before christmas, I installed them. Turns out HP has put in the firmware a check to disable any printing attempted without HP cartridges (which they sell for triple the price, for the EXACT same thing).So now, I cannot print my documents even though I have a perfectly functioning printer and cartridges, just because HP decides that their motivation to make indecent margins at my expense is higher than the motivation they have to put me first.Because now, I have wasted money on cartridges, I have to buy a new printer, and I still won't have my documents printed today unless I drive to town and find a place that will print me copies. So all of this will waste me about $500 plus 3 hours of my time at 150 an hour, so HP's policy of being anti-customer has costed me $950.When a company pretends to put customer first and then does that, you know that they have no link between the marketing values and their actual values. How can you ever buy a product from them knowing that any day, they may upload a firmware update that forces you to buy more from them ?",-2,-2,"{""General Sustainability"": -1, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": -1, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 0, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": -1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

Coming from someone with a fair amount of technology, printer, computer, etc. experience -- this was the most frustrating product that I have EVER purchased and not worth a penny. The customer experience in setup is god awful. The setup book, Apps/Tools and website are all completely inconsistent in how to actually setup the product and make it work. It claims to allow multiple devices over ethernet but that is a complete lie. You cannot use the second tray as your primary, so you have to keep the first flimsy tray open, which is a waste of space and complete counterintuitive to a sleek/small design. The entire experience from start to finish is god awful. If I had any alternative that allow me to wait for a replacement then I would return this in a minute, but unfortunately I need it immediately. Do NOT waste your money, time or frustration.

If you want something to run wirelessly for a small office that doesn’t have Ethernet/ LAN configuration, this isn’t for you. With that said, if you have the proper ecosystem established, this printer is a vertical or tour de force. I have mine configured in my home office running directly to the router hub via Ethernet cable. This would mean that as long as you access the LAN you can send print jobs to the printer.Being a laser printer, it’s blazing fast! The print is crisp and lines are sharp. I use this to print a lot of legal documents and declarations and it’s been holding up incredibly well. It is also very good on toner ( ink) conservation. If you want something suited for small to medium office use or even personal (given the connectivity limitation) I have no problems recommending this.

Both PCL and PostScript. Downside is expensive toner , although you can purchase third party toner (color not as good as oem). Fast double-sided printing. One of the best small office laser printers I’ve owned, and I’ve had HP, Canon, and Dell. Returned HP for this and am very glad I did. Setup was a breeze. Occasionally loses wireless network, but a quick restart does the trick. Restarts fast. Drivers are good, but could be better. Overall, a great printer for a small or home office.",1,1,"{""General Sustainability"": 0, ""Material: Bio Friendly"": 0, ""Material: Chemical Contents"": 0, ""Material: Recyclability"": 0, ""Material: Waste"": 0, ""Packaging"": 0, ""Environment: Bioenvironment"": 0, ""Environment: Climate"": 0, ""Energy: Consumption"": 1, ""Energy: Renewability"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Production"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Worker"": 0, ""Manufacturing Process: Supply"": 0, ""User Experience: Price"": -1, ""User Experience: Quality/Performance"": 1, ""User Experience: Safety"": 0}"

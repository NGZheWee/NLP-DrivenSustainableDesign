First, the positives: I wanted sheer white curtains. These curtains are sheer and they are white. Is that worth 2 stars? I don't think so. Now the rest: we measured CAREFULLY. The curtain rods height were pegged at exactly the height so the curtains would hang one inch off the floor. They were installed to exact measurements using a laser level. We worked out where the rod holders would be mounted so that there was no unsupported rod length over 4 feet, and the curtains would hang properly where we want them to. Each box contained 2 curtains. Each curtain was carefully unfolded and hand ironed. We even cleaned the floor around the ironing area so the curtains would not pick up any dust/dirt. Then they were hung one by one, 8 panels. As we stood back to admire them, I noticed they weren't hanging evenly at the floor. So we set about fidgeting with them, nothing made any difference. Then we measured the drapes, from the perfectly aligned curtain rods to the floor. Oh boy. Some were over 2 inches shorter than they were supposed to be. Some were touching the floor - longer than they're supposed to be. None actually matched. Three of the panels actually are too long on one side and too short on the other side, in the same curtain. We took out the laser level and checked the curtain rods again. Exactly spot on straight and level, even around a corner. Now we knew it was the curtains themselves. It's ridiculous how off they are, it's not even close. Now, floors themselves are rarely level, especially across a lengthy stretch. But...take a look at the pictures. Do you or does anyone you know have a floor that varies by 2 inches at the exact same spot? Look at the curtains. Those are 2 curtain panels directly next to each other. Even the one that isn't too short is too long! The only reason we didn't box this crap up and send it back was because we had put too much work into getting it exactly right. So we took them all down, and tried putting the longer ones together, and the shorter ones together. Even the too-long ones weren't the same! Some were just barely 1/8th inch off the floor. Some actually were bunched up on the floor. That's how "too long" they were. Exact same thing with the too-short ones. It's like they have a different crew of weasels running the machines every day. We did the best we could, and used some furniture/plants to help hide the goofs. But we know they're there, and it's completely unacceptable, hidden by furniture or not. In fact it's so substandard Amazon should probably look at this company and their products, and consider whether this company is appropriate for a seller's spot on the Amazon platform.

I regret that I didn't return these upon arrival. I thought the fabric would loosen and soften with a few washes, but I was wrong. After two wash cycles and two dry cycles, they still have deep creases from their packaging, and they still feel stiff and plasticky. Because of the stiff material, the curtains don't drape straight down. The material is too stiff to bunch properly, so the curtains flare as they hang. Sending these to the donation pile.

They were too short.  The company would not let you return them.  Bad business don't buy from them!They were too short.  I tried to return them.  However. The company would not let me return them.  Bad business.  Don't buy from them!

Definitely ‚Äúfaux.‚Äù They feel like plastic. Some panels had obvious imperfections.

We had a one month return window and, of course, a month and 5 days later, they fall apart. The curtains started separating from the rings up top in 5 spots. Absolute waste of money.

I bought these specifically because my other ones were 45 inches L and I wanted a see through one in the middle the same length well nope they‚Äôre not. These are 47 inches in L. Pretty but description it wrong.

It arrived with a bunch of black smudges on it!And for being labeled "semi sheer," I expected it to be less sheer. I would call these "sheer."

Poor quality. Material very thin and snagged

I received this curtain and sent it to Orlando as a gift but what a surprise!! Just look at the pictures yourself and think about it before buying this! It was used or dirty on some area and the metal rings are falling without even install the curtain in a rod or pull it, just grabbing it to iron it.Imaging if my relative wanted to wash it before using it! This is going back the way it is because that‚Äôs not fair as a regular client of Amazon, this is a shame!

Never opened package and curtain was ripped. It is in a clear bag that I could see the tear.

When I received the curtains I was in love with them! Once I got them hung I realized there were what looked like ink stains on both curtains in almost the exact same spot. One curtain had 2 ink spots, one on each side, and the other curtain had 1 ink spot in the same place as the other curtain. I tried to wash them by putting shout spray on them and then washing them in the washing machine but the stains didn't come out. They also didn't match the length of the blackout curtains that I bought. They were too long even though I bought both the sheer and the black out curtain in 63 length.  I am returning the curtains and ordering a different brand.

This is the third time I've purchased the exact same sheers (based on "Order Again").  The 1st were perfect.  Silky smooth.  The 2nd pair, way different, inferior product.  The 3rd are HORRIBLE.  Feel like plastic.  Not silky at all and the fabric looks and feels more like a netting.  I'm not returning only because it's for my She-Shed, so no big deal.  But if I bought these for my home, I'd definitely be returning.

Too sheer and cheaply made.The material sagged.

Purchased two sets in April 2022. They were good until today. The tag states the curtains are machine washable, so I washed them on a delicate low spin cycle, and they tore all around the grommets. If you never intend to wash them, I guess they'll be fine. However, if you do, plan on buying new curtains because they will be worthless after. I do not not recommend.

The quality is very poor, the seller is bad and sent curtains that were returned by others. Angry at the seller's behavior„ÄÇ

I ordered the yellow and they are actually an orange color. So I can only give a review on the color as I did not take them out of the package. Very disappointed that the color is so far off from the picture. i am sending them back.

The day after I was eligible for a return on this item, I noticed that three of the panels have spots where the fabric has started to separate from the grommets.  Pretty bummed that I didn't notice it a day earlier because now I'm stuck with these crappy curtains that I'm going to have to replace at my own cost.

I  ordered these as semi sheer and the drapes are actually sheer. The material  is not as advertised. I will be returning them.

Too sheer for my own liking, but well it is what is it when you buy things online. I hope they put on HPI rating on the description.

My mistake,  too heavy

I ordered 3.  2 are fine and 1 is the wrong length.  I told the seller and there's been no response regarding the replacement I requested.  This is unacceptable.  Don't buy this product.

I didn‚Äôt expect these curtains to be great, they‚Äôre cheap & I wasn‚Äôt looking to spend a ton of money but these curtains are terrible! They feel almost like a hard plastic, they don‚Äôt look too bad from afar but get close & you‚Äôll notice the very low quality

I just received them. I opened them so excited to take a look at them and SURPRISE!,  they are ripped around one of the grommets! Back to where they came from. PS: They are light weight and the color was pretty what a shame there‚Äôs no reinforcement where the grommets are.

I thought the item I paid for was supposed to be NEW, however, you can clearly see it's been used. If I wanted to save money and pay for a used product I would've done so. This is not the what I paid for.

Thin poor quality

It was thinner than shown in pictures. I‚Äôll have to order a second set now

Not only are these curtains cheap - flimsy, light grommets and cheap feel to the fabric, they are 6-8 inches shorter than the length I ordered. Returning and headed to Target now.

Grommets pulled apart from material in no time! Should last more than 30 days! Had taken them down to wash and try to get wrinkles out and every single one a grommet or 2 had pulled away or completely came out tried to fix and it was pointless!

I ordered these, got pocket curtain instead, decided I liked, ordered another pair, got awful grommet curtains that were too sheer. Now I have to return those and figure out what the other curtain I received instead that I like better. ¬ø

Not happy

Curtains had yellow spotting as soon as I opened the bag

They feel cheap target has better quality for $20

The curtains were advertised as semi transparent. They allow viewing in my windows üòü

1stars because it was supposed to be 2 panels and I only received 1 and I didn‚Äôt realize it until after it was too late to return them.

I bought two sets of these curtains that. When I first got them I would have given them 5 stars. They let in light while still providing a bit of privacy and just are generally pretty.2 weeks later the grommets have started falling off.

Curtains are see through and wrinkly not to mention so thin! Do not buy these

Living room. Curtains were very bad quality and not worth the money.  My room looks very sloppy.

very poor quality‚Ä¶ that's what it looks like after the first wash‚Ä¶ it's not worth the money

Bought these curtains and they have wrinkles in them that wont come out. They will be returned

I bought this thinking it was yellow, it is not is more like orange color

I was very disappointed! There were ZERO grommets in the ones I received. I‚Äôm jealous of the photos with grometted panels.

Need 2

very thin, not protective, showing through the glass

Do NOT purchase these curtains!! I only received ONE curtain and it was 100% opaque. It was also far shorter than the product description!! I am so disappointed- especially since it‚Äôs offered with prime.

Cancelled order

Looks cheap and wrinkles will not iron out. Dont waste your money

Thin like gauze, grommets not lined-up.  Curtains not even at hem.

I would have liked these if they didn‚Äôt come already used or stained. Looks like sharpie or ink of some sort. On multiple spots on one panel.

These are the right length and color. However, these are very cheaply made and doesn‚Äôt quite lay correctly on the rod.

About six months ago, I ordered multiples of these and they were beautiful, white, sheer color. I just received another set but they showed up really dingy yellow. I took a picture of what was sent next to my existing white ones so you can see how they compare. I will be trying to return these and hopefully I‚Äôll have better luck with the new set.I gave it two stars because the first said I ordered were beautiful, but this set is not. This is more of a quality control review, they should inspect everything before they send it out to avoids bad reviews.

The first set of curtains arrived with uneven hems and dark stains across both curtains. I had them replaced. The second set arrived torn by one of the grommets and with the same dark stains on them. I do not recommend these curtains for this reason.

Didn‚Äôt like color or material

These drapes are very thin, sheer and bright white.  The quality just isn't there for me.

I bought two sets of these curtains that I‚Äôve had for about a year now and when I first got them I probably would have given them 5 stars. They let in light while still providing a bit of privacy and just are generally pretty.However after one year the grommets have started falling off. I guess you get what you pay for. These will not hold up.

These are not quite the sheer linen I‚Äôve seen in the stores. They are very shiny. If you like shiny you will like these. I like the more matte stylish linen look and feel. Kind of cheap looking. Well, they were cheap that‚Äôs why I bought them. Haha. Too late to return. They would look better if they were not shiny.

Very nice curtains but hardly yellow gold.  More like school bus yellow.  Looking for a different color.  I do like the curtains very much.

its not really the sheer material im used to seeing it looks like sheer mixed with gauze but i just need it to cover something up so its better than nothing

I REALLY wanted to love these curtains and they are the PERFECT color for what I wanted, I got the olive,  but it was too sheer‚Ä¶I wanted sheer and had sheer before but my other ones has a little more texture to them, so sad but I will be returning.

Has a sewn in care label in a very prominent location, part of which is sewn inside a seem, cannot be removed without ripping that seem, and is very visible through the sheer material. So it looks pretty tacky.

They are all the way see through, doesn't really block any light and I have 4 panels on one window.

I really liked these curtains but they aren‚Äôt holding up well. They‚Äôre ripping at the tops where the grommets are.

The actual length is not 84 inches. When i hang this next to another curtains, it‚Äôs probably about a couple inches longer. Makes my drapery look uneven. Lack of quality control.

Cheap Chinese product worthless

Like the overall look of these curtains and their amount of privacy however they are of poor quality considering they hang at different lengths. This set is almost a full inch different in length so they don‚Äôt hang evenly which I hate.

You get what you pay for. The bottom hems are all different length and crooked. Really awful. I already got rid of all the packaging so I guess I am stuck with them. I will have to cut them to window lenght. Bummer

Definitely not "linen like". More like a ordinary sheet. Neatly packaged. Easy to hang. Using for spare room. I need 45 long, hard to find, so I'll keep them. Just not anything like linen.

I didn't like how see thru they were, too thin , didn't look like that in the photo.

These are very sheer - not semi sheer.

It looks very cheap and not pretty, I have to return it. It doesn‚Äôt look like photos here.

The color is a bit off.  I ordered the gray sheer and it almost looks like a green color.

I returned this item.  It was not as advertised.  No grommets present.

i don‚Äôt hate them but i don‚Äôt love them. they look okay, they feel cheap. kinda scratchy and  stiff.

Very poor quality, ordered navy blue sewn with a light blue thread

The length was good. Quick delivery but the color looks more greenish then gray. I desperately need them so can't return. Will try to get another color.

Wrinkles too set in the fabric.

This is not worth the money at all. Really sheer and can‚Äôt stop any light. Not expected quality.

They aren‚Äôt all the same length which is very disappointing and it drives me crazy when I look at them.

Did not like the shade of yellow

Feels like plastic

They were frayed around the grommets otherwise they would be perfect

was good but was shorter the 63 inch didn't fit right had to send them back

The quality of the fabric is visibly cheap looking. I do not recommend.

The curtains stick together so they look really thin (which they are). They look and feel cheap

Unhappy with quality

Roughest material I have ever felt,  Stiff like a board.  Once you hang them from afar they look ok,  but i was so dissappointed with these, I ordered 10 sets and did not want to take time to return, though i should of.  If you want soft and flowy, as sheers should be,  DO NOT BUY THESE.  I dont understand how everyone on the reviews are giving these curtains high reviews and have wonderful things to say.  I can honestly say that I have bought better quality curtains at the family dollar store.  My review is out of honesty not from anger.  Stiff and Rough is basically what i want you to know about these.  stiff and rough.

Nice quality but too light in color. It's white & not ivory

Perfect item and would recommend for purchase.

I ordered the DWCN bronze colored sheers.  They are nice for the price.  I had to iron them before I hung them.  Easy to hang with the grommet top.  They block out the glare from the sun.  I think I would hand wash them rather than put them in the washing machine because of the grommets.  I would recommend them because of the price.

If you order more than one set...as I did for a very wide set of windows ... Be prepared for them to be different lengths. Otherwise, I like the texture of the curtain and that they are wrinkle free. Always look fresh and hold their shape. Easy to move around.  Obviously..I kept them.

I should have read the entire description but was in a hurry. The pictures look like they are bronze in color. They are silver and don't match my bronze curtain bar. They should change those pictures and they would have less returned product.

I had to buy 2 sets of 2 for these to achieve the dark olive green that the preview photo shows when sunlight isn‚Äôt shining thru - not a huge deal at this price, but just a heads up for anyone who wanted that look too.

Washed according to pkg. Ironed and ironed, steamed...still wrinkled. Glad I didn't pay much. Wish I'd kept my old ones!

Pretty color, just a bit darker than I expected for this time of year. Come the summer when the days are much brighter, I'm sure they'll be perfect.

I don't know if they were mismeasured when they were hemmed or what, but they are 1 inch shorter than the 84-in curtains that I already have hanging.

Quality & material were great.  Color was way off.  Navy Blue turned out to be a wild, loud blue that would not match anything that I know of.  Grandkids may make play canopy out of it.  Did not bother to return.....too much trouble as there was no return slip included.

They don't steam iron well!

They were actually very nice but were to sheer for what I needed.  The workmanship and construction were exceptionally .  Great fabric and a wonderful color.  I may have kept them but had no place else they would work.  You can buy them again and again.  The cost was also unbelievably affordable.

The curtains are fine with a true white color and sheerness. However after washing once, following directions and using gentle cycle and hanging to dry, the grommets on 3 of my 6 panels are pulling off the fabric. One fell off completely in the wash.

Don‚Äôt expect miracles from these curtains. The edges are not all sewn straight and the length is not always 84‚Äù! But let‚Äôs not forget they are fairly cheap so you get what you paid for. I am not overly excited but they will do until I change them again. Polyester at its best!

If you are looking for very sheer - like if it‚Äôs dark outside and you have the lights inside and everyone outside can see inside your house - then this is for you. I got the light blue ones wanting a little bit of light but still privacy. They were basically nothing

I don‚Äôt like how the bottom of the sheers flare out. I like for my sheers to lay nice and neat from top to bottom. The material is okay for the amount I paid. They are light weight which is a plus for me.

The look of these curtains is as expected. However, poor fabrication as many of the seams have loose strings and sown in to some areas are multi colored strings that may have been part of another product. However these are inexpensive and will do for a temporary fix.

I recently purchased about 20 pairs of these curtains. While I love them I had to reorder a pair to finish up a sliding door. When the curtain came it had been repackaged and was certainly not white!! I am totally disappointed. I will have to return and reorder again!

It very pretty my husband also love it, however the white is longer on its lenght, i ordered lenght of 90" and 84" both are longer , the burgundy is same brand same date and time that i purchased with the white.

When I opened the curtains, they had black dots I assumed magic marker. Not Happy about this because they're going to hang on a white wall so you'll be able to see the spots.

Length is uneven. One side was a half inch shorter than the other side. These are also very sheer. I like the way they look at night versus the day. When sun hits you dont see the color very well. Very sheer.

I like the material and did not come so wrinkle. The length perfect. But the color are not accurate of whats in the picture. pictures are lighter green I receive a darker green almost like a light olive color. Disappointed that part.

Sizes are not accurate I bought this Nd some blackout same size Nd this are longer they are nice I would off given it a 5 star if I didn‚Äôt have to return Nd get in a different size

pic lead me to believe the curtains would be more opaque not impressed with description very faulty

Ordered these for my daughters room. One sheer is longer than the other sheer. One is correct length, other is clearly not! Not happy at all

The presentation was okay.  But the material was so thin that I have had to duplicate the order in order to have enough coverage.

Nice curtains however not all same length

Length is longer than stated by over an inch, but curtains are nice if you are using them alone and not paired with another set like I am.

Perfect for letting some light in while providing some privacy; however, the shade of brown is different between the two different lengths.

one of the products I purchased was rusted

Thin

Good but not soft at all but not bad I love then it's not like im gonna be rubbing all over them

They are full and bright white..but more a nylon look than linen as described..not bad,just not what i had in mind..

Didn‚Äôt have a sheer look to the curtains. Should have spent the extra couple bucks to get quality ones.

It is important to note that the red is bright red.  It looked much darker on my monitor, closer to maroon, but it is primary-color red.

Its not for my sliddinf door, i returned it

it's ok but I wouldn't buy it again

Uneven and longer than 63 inches

Too thin and shorter than the windows. üòë

Cheap material.

We returned it.

I was trying to replace some damaged sheer white curtains, I thought these,were supposed to be sheer, instead they were semi sheer.

I did fixed one size total need to finish so I did but i did keep because i need than.

Hemming is Way off

THE COLOR IS A BIT  DECEIVING

I didn‚Äôt really like them. They are very thin compared to the ones l bought from the discount stores. The only reason l kept them is beacuse l couldn‚Äôt find 90inch long . When k washed them they still had wrinkles so l had to iron them and some wrinkles were more difficult to go away.

One curtain is longer than the other.  I just jury rigged the pole to hide it.  They are pretty and hold up well.

Some of the creases are folded the wrong direction

Ordered wrong size there thin but would probably keep if they fit

Worked where I wanted them to

I was looking high and low to replace 6 100% cotton voile semi sheer curtains (made in India) which provided excellent privacy, floated beautifully in the breeze, and were a lovely ivory color -- a color very hard to replicate with polyester. Because voile is very delicate, my old curtains developed holes after many washings. Anyway, I guess I was a bit seduced by the description of these curtains as faux linen and voile like, and they were a decent price for long curtains. I purchased 3 packs of 2 each, and use only 1 per window. When I opened them I was sad to realize they are 100% polyester wirhout a trace if cotton or linen, and the fabric is not soft to the touch. However, the wrinkles from folding and packing were easy to iron out on the "Poly" setting of my iron, and the curtains are a soft white with a little texture to the fabric that appears to provide semi-sheerness while also letting in a good amount of diffused sunlight. Another reviewer said they tested to make sure that neighbors can't see in from the outside, so I'm going to trust that review as my nearest neighbors are well across the street. If I was not budgeting these days I would never have bought polyester curtains, but these work fine for now. As described by the seller, the hems are sewn very cleanly, the grommets are decent, and I only found a single stray piece of thread among the 6 curtains I purchased.

The drapes fortunately are fine, but they were clearly someone else‚Äôs return.  They didn‚Äôt even try to make these look like they were new.  They were wadded up in a clear plastic bag that had a big hole ripped in it.  I was tempted to return them but they seem fine and I can steam out the wrinkles.

The quality is very nice.

These are nice sheer curtains I bought for my dining room. They hang nicely after the wrinkles fall out, however, they aren‚Äôt all the same length. Three of the panels are an inch or so longer than the others. Other than that discrepancy , the curtains are nice. Would‚Äôve given five stars, but the lengths aren‚Äôt uniform

I wanted these curtains to cover my sliding door I don‚Äôt use and instead had to put them in the bedroom because they weren‚Äôt long enough. I realized they didn‚Äôt reach the same length of my bedroom curtains also and my bedroom curtains are 84 inches in length. The curtains I actually received are 73/74 in size. Other than the wrong size sent to me, I absolutely love them!

These are nice and the quality is good, but very sheer.  Will be using another set of curtains over them with a double rod.

I‚Äôm quite happy with the overall feel of these curtains. The fabric is nicely woven and the seams are well done. The only reason I took a star off is because the measurements are a bit off. I bought mine in the olive green color, 45‚Äùx52‚Äù. Super difficult finding curtains that are specifically at 45‚Äù. As you can see from my pictures, my windows are in an alcove so I don‚Äôt have an option to let some of it hang past the window. These curtains measure at least 46‚Äù-47‚Äù. So they pool at the bottom. Not enough of an issue to return them BUT I‚Äôll probably take them to a tailor to get them hemmed shorter for a better fit.Also, as you can see, they are EXTREMELY sheer. I expected that though, so I got a pair of blackout curtains to go over top of them for when I need privacy. The rings are plastic, not metal by the way. Again, for the value, I don‚Äôt mind. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with this product. They add a bit of shade to my room (which gets direct sunlight) but doesn‚Äôt make my room super dark, I love natural sunlight, just not to the level of blinding me haha

To find curtains a certain length that are sheer and grommet style is hard. Glad I found these! Fits my bathroom window perfectly.

I like them. I use them on a dual rod with black out curtains in the front. They were not quite as sheer as I thought they would be which is a good thing. My rooms still receive plenty of light through them and still allow good sight while blocking veiws looking in as long as it is lighter outside than in. They are 100% polyester which I have found to be a benifit as they are easier to machine wash and a quick low setting on the dryer leaves them wrinkle free.Also props to the seller as I made a few step in sizing properly and was able to exchange with no issues.I would post pictures but Amazon asks for to many permissions and acccess to my device that aren't necessary.

Yes, they are meant to be long but wish just a tad shorter if I am being honest. They basically almost touch the ground in my office, which I don't like. Otherwise, I like the sheer that gives some privacy when I am working but keeps some light in as well. Overall, good product but still wrinkly.

I decided to swope out the dated look of vertical blinds to the patio door with these nice sheets. They're a little bling but I like the look and they are just sheer enough to add a little privacy but still allow light in. The grommet hanging make these sheets easy to open as well.

Very nice sheer curtains.

These curtains are about as sheet as you can get without being invisible. However, I like them. I wanted something that allowed me to see out but didn't allow others to be able to see directly into my house. These are perfect for that. I bought 3 pair, 6 panels, for a typical sized front window. I like having them a bit closer together because they are so thin. I haven't washed them yet. I have had only one other set of curtains with grommets and they didn't wash well, so I shall see. However, they are not too expensive and not in a room with heavy use. By the time they need a washing I will probably be tired of them.

Look nice super sheer. Double up on what you think you need. 4 panels even 6 woukd be good for my use. Wrinkle free is nice feature.

Color is a nice warm color.  Hard to steam and get the wrinkles out.  A little to sheer but works fine.  Good price.

The color is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Fabric is a little more coarse than some sheer curtains. Overall worth the money.

They actually go great with the other pair i purchased.

I love my curtains. The olive green is wonderful. However they came folder (obviously) and those lines were hard to remove, and running them on an airfluff with drier balls and sheets got some of the lines out but also made them wrinkly overall. very hard material to maintain. Also a bit more sheer than I'd like, and material was more plastic like than I prefer.However, I'm content.

The color was not nearly as burgundy as I had hoped. It‚Äôs more of a dull red. OK, but now I think next time I will buy curtains in person.

Colors are a lot darker than the photos

I purchased 2 pairs(2 pkg‚Äôs) for my bathroom after a remodel. Unfortunately I missed the return date by 7 days. Very pleased with appearance & quality but 1 pair was shorter. I need to order another pair since 4 panels were not enough. Hoping the shorter panels will blend in once in the middle of the other panels.

These curtains are nice quality for the cost.They fit my hard-to-size window perfectly.The material is very sheer (see through) andcolors could be combined to create laying under heavierdrapes or combined color variation for color and style change.Had they come in colors green or red I would have purchased more.I would recommend this Seller to anyone needing tofind curtains for hard-to-fit windows.

The media could not be loaded.
                



For what I paid I'm very satisfied. They're sheer but not too sheer. They definitely need some steaming and would definitely need to be washed and dried on a delicate cycle.

The product is great. Suites my need.About Amazons Delivery: "It was handed directly to a resident." NO IT WAS NOT!! It was left at the end of my drive where anyone walking/driving by could have easily stolen it. Delivery Driver didn't honk, knock, nothing! Unacceptable.! Watch your deliveries, folks. That's the first this has happened but to note that it was handed directly to me...NO. That person needs to find another job.

These are as described. A sheer curtain with grommets. Diffuses light but does not block light. Not the highest quality fabric, even after washing they are still a scratchy type of material but they do the job for my purposes.  I doubled the number of panels I originally ordered to provide more fullness. I am going to order another set for a companion window.  You can't beat the price.

Love these. Vibrant colors. On the sheerless scale of 1-5 (5 opaque) they are 2.

However, I would prefer if both sides of the curtain were of the same fabric. Only the inside is the fabric and the outside is a white backing which does wrinkle. I would like  inside as well as outside of the window top look the same. Not so with these curtains.

The colour and texture is exactly what I was looking for! Ordered some more so extra fullness. Highly recommend !!!

These are great sheers for the price! Although, when we received them, the length was WAY longer than 95". We bought other curtains to go over them that were 96" and the sheers are still way longer than those. I will have to hem the bottoms of the sheers to fit the window. Other than that, they are great!

I put these in my kitchen. I love the way they look I ordered grey 52'√ó63.I came back to order more and they were out of stock so I'm just going to leave my black out curtains on the end of my windows.I really wanted all sheer curtains

I like this curtain but bought the wrong size.

good product for the money. great color

Would have been 5 stars, but 63" weren't 63 inches.. had to use the 84" I ordered.. great quality, great curtain, the sheer white are REAL WHITE , but like one reader said it will reflect either what is outside or in your room, and it can look gauzy, just wash or iron.if you are going for the sheer look these will work.. .  WILL definitely buy from DWCN again...

The curtains have a good quality. I'm happy with it.

I was surprised to see the silver grommets and not the brass tone grommets. It may be my mistake for not reading the entire description.If the curtains come with this brass tone I would be willing to return that order which I have opened but have not taken out of its original packaging. Please inform me.

Color- it‚Äôs a little more blue than what I preferred. Other than that good quality, beautiful piece.

These are almost impossible to get the creases out of. I tried ironing them and steaming them and the wrinkles are still there. After having them hang for awhile they‚Äôre mostly gone, but they don‚Äôt look as nice as I wish they did.

thought they said semi shear, thought doubling them up would make them less shear. it did not, very see thru, and arrived with deep wrinkles, had to send them back

Was a little too thin but love the wrinkle free

They make my living room look nicer, but they don't do a whole lot to "tint" my windows--was hoping they'd provide more privacy than they do without blacking-out light. They are also a little wrinkled.

These were the only curtains I could find to fit the off size window. Since mini blinds are behind them it provides some coverage. Looks nice but doesn't block view much.

I love the curtains but I ordered 90inch and there not that size

These are great sheer, my only complaint is that one panel is wrinkled and I can‚Äôt seem to get the wrinkles out!

A nice sheer curtain, good price, and seems to be made well. Grommets at the top are securely attached. Decent value for the money.

Thin, cheap, and not bad. Not the most private curtains as you can see right through them but they look nice

Truly sheer curtains.  Just what I wanted to replace winter heavy curtains. They let the light in for my houseplants and brighten the dining area.  I have blinds for the evenings to block seeing inside house.They are very wide and well made.  I washed them with a tiny amt of detergent,  in light cycle and dried them on light settings, and wrinkles are out, only a few.  I don't think the wrinkles will iron out, took the chance and they look great. I also got a great price, however ordered longer than I needed by mistake, will attempt hemming them or just keep them this way.

Just what I needed. They were well-packaged with no wrinkles. Perfect amount of sheer applied while blinds are open. Thin material. Nice quality. I will order again.

I looovvvee these sheers! They didn‚Äôt come wrinkled, and the color is very nice and can match with any curtain. I love the length, I was actually shocked at the privacy these curtain sheers have to offer. It almost gives a filtering effect that makes it to where you can‚Äôt see inside so well. I do recommend

They are so elegant! Thank you! Price was good too!

The curtains are beautiful; I had measured incorrectly.Reordering  3 sets for my guest room. Hangs nicely and looks elegant.

The curtains are transparent, you can see outside, but very difficult to see inside, I love the thickness , wrinkles fell out once the curtains were hung within a couple of hours. Very lightweight and I love the texture made the room look very bright and elegant.

Absolutely as advertised. Perfect sizing and spot on color. Would buy again.

I loved everything about itThe color and I can still see out the window

Almost like a linen look ! Really nice fabric! Perfect coloring, cozy vibe in the bedroom.

Loved them.  Right color, right size. Works great.

Easy to install. Looks great

I love them, the color was what I wanted

Like new. Will purchase again if needed

I love them,high quality, wash and wear beautifully.,recommended them to family and friends.

Fit great

They were the perfect match to add to curtains I already had up. They really added to the looks of my living room.

These curtains are very sheer and light weight.They are somewhat wrinkled from packaging. The grommets are great and the curtain easily slids on. The color is a nice bright white. I was hoping there would be a bit more weight to the curtain and not so stiff. They are nicely hemmed and do let the light shine in while offering some privacy. I do like the overall look of them.

I like the sheerness of this curtain. And its so ight

I love these!! Tge were a little wrinkled but I love them! They are see through but just enough to not see straight in. The light still comes in and its perfect

I bought these to go over our blinds in the bedroom. Perfect accent to the window!

I originally bought 2 pairs for a double window that measures 36‚Äù each.  The curtains are 100‚Äù wide for the pair.  So I had 200‚Äù of curtain in width which would have been okay except you could see inside.  So I needed another pair and hung them up in total 300‚Äù of panel.  It did the job and looks full and still allows light in.  The material is not bad.  It is sewn meticulously.  However, the hems could have been more generous to give it an expensive look.  But all in all, it does the job and looks very nice.  Pleased with the purchase.

Nice looking sheer curtains useful for blocking glare and from keeping people seeing in.

Substantial weight, expensive look & beautiful shade of off white. I'm using these and lieu of closet doors and I was happy to find they came in 90 inch length. I was going to get chairs and I am so happy I went with these. A few dollars more and they are going to look so expensive when I get them up. Thicker than sheers & not as thick as curtains.

measure the length and width you want and you will not be dissapointed! now to the fabric, i love linen and i love wispy and flowing, yet durable and strong and these curtains scored high points on every level! they are semi- transparent, have an  awesome feel and they look great!..especially where you want light to soften a room. love these!

Green is my favorite color, so calming after hard days of work. These curtains are beautiful billowing out lightly with the warm breeze passing through them.

Measurements were the perfect size, fabric was just as described.We had to make two separate orders as they were low on inventory, but received on time and the second order was early!

Good quality very pretty

I recently purchased a set of sheer curtains, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations. The quality is outstanding, and they live up to the advertised promises. The fabric is delicate yet durable, providing an elegant and airy feel to the room. The sheerness allows just the right amount of light to filter through, creating a soft and inviting ambiance.What impressed me most was the attention to detail in the craftsmanship. The seams are impeccable, and the stitching is sturdy, ensuring longevity. The curtains also hang beautifully, thanks to well-designed grommets that make installation a breeze.

I ordered a few pairs for my windows in the olive color. They are beautiful up on the window and allows a perfect amount of light in my bedroom. Very happy customer.

The curtains allow the perfect amount of light and they're very pretty

We have a beautiful, large window in the front of our. We have always loved the view from our window, but we noticed that people could see in as easily as we could look out.When we hung the window sheers, we noticed that we could see out, but no one could see in. Besides the security that we now have, we also have a beautiful window treatment that adds absolute beauty to our home.

These sheer curtains are absolutely beautiful. So elegant, give light to the living room. Great value for the price

Pleased with my purchase. Glad to tear down those dated blinds. Opens up my whole office.

Loved these curtains. Color was just right, sheer enough to keep my sunlight coming in.

Love these curtains. Beautiful color!

These curtains let just the right amount of light in and I appreciate that. I want light to come through our window in the living room, but don't want it to be overpowering. So these have been a great addition to that space.

I love the color

Very nice material order them for my living room now for the bedroom

These are just what I was looking for. Curtains that were sheer enough to let in lots of light, but also gives me privacy by preventing people from being able to look in during the day (I've confirmed this by having someone stand outside while I was inside). These are also reasonably sturdy for the price. I have a cat that occasionally gets caught on these curtains (she gets excited when a bird passes by) and aside from some snags, the curtains have held up and not ripped.Note: If it's dark outside, but lights are on inside, people CAN see in.

Very good.

I wanted shear curtains to be the center of my picture window. They work so well with what I was going for

I bought these for my bedroom, I love them, they were almost wrinkle free, didn't even have to iron. Took straight out of wrapper and hung up.

Quality is excellent for the price - they are very sheer (which we wanted ) and soften the light and the visually hard edges of our back sliding glass door nicely . They did require a wash and a run on the dryer steam cycle to get out the creases from being packaged. Recommend.

They are perfect for bedrooms. They are thin and lets light shine in. Great purchase for the money. Item is as described.

It felt synthetic when I touched it, so for a moment there I had my doubts.It looks beautiful though, it diffuses the intense Florida light sneaking through the blinds. So now, I have less heat inside and more soft white light. It sparkles a little bit too. It‚Äôs not tacky though. I‚Äôm happy with it.I bought twice the amount that I needed, but that‚Äôs actually a good thing‚Ä¶

Beautiful curtain

The material was not good and the hem was totally  uneven.  I sent them back. Not worth the money

terrible

These are not blackout curtains. They are thin. The hems are uneven. VERY hard to iron out the wrinkles. They look awful. Tried for a few days but took them down and returned. Yuck.

I have had these curtains for about a month. I recently noticed a weird smell in the bedroom where these curtains were installed. I couldn't figure where the smell was coming from and never suspected that it would be the curtains. It turns out it was and these curtains came down immediately and I tossed them in the garbage. I don't know if I got some previously returned curtains that maybe somebody had spilled some nasty chemical on them or if its a factory defect...I don't know for sure. These windows are installed on a window that faces the sun in the afternoon so I don't know if its possibly a reaction of the material used with the heat of the sunrays. I really like these curtains but I couldn't tolerate the strange smell that they developed. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THESE CURTAINS TO NOBODY!

They aren‚Äôt blackout at all, very misleading

Was 2 pair of drapes.  Side edged were not straight at all and the bottom seam on one was cut off  really crooked . Looks so bad  would never buy from you again. Looked like a 3 year old made them.

Finally decided to get some new curtains and these were a very good price‚Ä¶ I go to put the last panel up and there is a cut in it.. and no, it‚Äôs not for me.. very disappointed

As you can see in the video these are so thin I can see my hand through then.  They do not block any light at all.  Very disappointed. I had to wait an extra day for them to arrive and I had already disposed of my blinds so now I have nothing to block the light in my bedroom.  Completely FALSE representation of the product.  Returning the curtains---don't be scammed by this seller.

Installed the curtain today. They are 3 inch too long, so laying on the ground and not wide enough.So they doesn‚Äôt fit like expected

The description indicates this is a blackout curtain.  It is not.  I was able to see the light come through the curtain when closed.

I wanted to like these curtains, except I ordered 54" yellow curtains to go with my 54" gray curtains. As you can see in the photos, they are NOT 54" but 56". I am returning these, and going somewhere else. The 1st and 2nd pics are without flash, and more true to the actual color and what reviewers stated. The 3rd pic is with a flash to see better without the shadows. In any case, the size is way off to say the least. Very sad!

This product is 100% not worth your time or money.  We received our product with pristine packaging but both curtain panels were damaged. There were major runs in the fiber down each panel. There were RED STAINS on both panels. We returned this item and opted to receive a replacement assuming this was an unfortunate fluke. The replacement panels we received were ALSO filled with runs in the fabric.Order at your own risk. This has been an ongoing headache and we are still without curtains..... Never experienced such a consistently poor quality product on Amazon. This is absolutely unacceptable at this price point.

I ordered 2 sets (at the same time) of curtains, thinking they would be identical. After washing, to remove the wrinkles, I hung them and I noticed something was off.  The length and sheen dont match!! üòî

I liked the color and size for my bathroom window and I couldn‚Äôt beat the price, so I ordered a set. Arrived on them. After removing and hanging them I noticed very small holes of light coming through some areas. Mostly on the parts where the fold creases were. Upon closer inspection, they definitely had some sort of tiny separations all over the curtains and the fold crease lines are still present even after hanging up for a couple ofMonths. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy again, but they were cheap and that‚Äôs wHat I got.

Don't waste your time and money on these - I bought a set of white 'blackout' curtains, and they block out as much light as your standard notebook paper (NOT MUCH). Now I have to spend my time returning these. 'Thermal Insulated' is also an overstatement, but hey, I guess any layer can be a 'thermal insulator'.

Shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised with what the price was, but tried anyways. Light filters in through the curtains, not that much ‚Äúblack out‚Äù still gets ungodly hot in the morning hours of my bedroom after saying these would soak up some of that heat.. nope. Get other ones !

Black curtains are all crunched up and wrinkled. See through spots, and seem to have glitter ir some sparkling debris on them. The wrinkes are really irritating.

The red 48x54 panels I received are definitely not blackout curtains. Annoying because the last set I ordered from the same brand were fine. I included pictures of the original purchase with the black backing and the newly received panels that purport to be blackout but lack the black backing material. Buyer beware.

Did not fit my son's window.  Too short. Other brands in same measurements fit daughter's window.

These curtains are made horribly! The stitching is bunched, they don't hang straight and I'm very disappointed!!

The curtains arrived dirty and had runs in the fabric.  Very disappointed that brand new curtains had flaws in the fabric.  The color and sheen is very pretty though, and they are soft.  Just wish they were in new condition.

I ordered 2 packages of this curtin, so 4 panels in total.. none of them were the same length and as u can see by the photo they dont darken the room very well.. very disappointing üòï all the hems were different by about 2 inches in length

It was the wrong color yellow. When I opened the box, it was sitting on top of the branded plastic package that it was supposed to be wrapped in. It also had a grey footprint on one of the panels.

If these are Emerald then I am the king of the Leprechauns. These are freaking TEAL and they look like plastic tablecloth covers. Returning. Thanks for the inaccurate description and waiting everyone's time.

I have another curtain at home that is blackout and this one is far from being a blackout!!  false advertising

wrinkled- after over a week I can't get them out!

Don‚Äôt buy it if you want blackout

I don‚Äôt like that the description of the item did not mention that these have a shiny finish.

I would not order this again. There are several little holes and a couple of stains. The wrinkles are also extremely hard to get out. They‚Äôre not truly blackout either. I will say the color is very true, but that‚Äôs the only positive.

These curtains were ordered in red, they came with on pair a different color of red.  The pair of different color are shorter.  Took them down will not order curtains on line again.  Poor quality and service.

Bathroom

Love them but it doesn't black out light. And I ordered 2 sets and they aren't the same color or size.

Pen marks and stains. Was ok at blocking light but not blackout.

Keep the room dark and cool.

These "blackout" curtains are a freaking joke ü§°So tired of bs products.

These curtains are so cheaply made and look so bad. I tried to at least take the tacky silver rings off thinking it would look better and it was like coke can lids and made them look worse. You get what you pay for.

I ordered these because it said it came as a pair. Ordered 2 sets. I received 2 curtains! Reordered and again received 2 curtains, not 2 sets! Very disappointed and very inconvenienced. Returning and will not order again!

The color of the curtains is nice I liked them but they are thinner than I thought and they are not a total blackout you can still see a lot of light through and they don‚Äôt help to keep heat in

I ordered 2 sets of red curtains with grommets. 1 pair had grommets and the other pair does not. Needed them ASAP so no time to returnüôÑ

They wasnt as described.Gave it away

They are totally sheer!

Did not block out all light.

I ordered the "pink" this is PURPLE!!!!!!!

Look like a shower curtain

No blackout at all. No back liner.

Both curtains arrived snagged. DO NOT BUY.

limey-mustard...NOT yellow....yuck...returning

Bought these because they said blackout, but 100% not

We ordered these for my daughters bedroom. They however do not do a a good job blocking out the light which was the whole point. We ordered pink and it definitely needed another layer. I found a different set on here that had a black backside which is what these needed. Don‚Äôt waste your money if you truly want black out

I ordered the pink curtains and they look orange üòëThey block out the sun for sure but I wanted a pretty pink color for the girls room,disappointing.

I bought the curtains for half the price during prime days but these ARE NOT black out curtains.  Good quality and shipped quickly but not what I thought I ordered.  I read the product description but did not scroll through pictures.  There is no black material sown behind the curtain itself.

After much delay I finally got my room painted I proceeded to hang these curtainsThey are not the right color and make the room too dark

It‚Äôs nice

Reads blackout in description. Not blackout. Not even close

These darken the room but are not even close to blackout. They are made of pretty thin fabric that snags easily.  They are not double or triple layered. I will be returning these.

Curtain is nice. Hood quality. Only received one panel. Description of product clearly says two panels. Do not find a way to contact the seller.

I bought these for a blackout curtain but it still filters the light

The only way to reasonably call this a  blackout curtain would be to only use the phrase when it‚Äôs dark outside.  Then it‚Äôs keeping the black out.But it fails miserably at keeping the sun out. Take a look at the attached photo.Waste of money. Look elsewhere.

I already received these curtains for one of my windows but unfortunately this current item here came without the rings where the rod would slide through.. Had to replace it and hoping to get the right item... See the attached images. The first one shows the defected one. I just hung it to see what it would look like but nah.. I can't hang that while the other one is already hanging and looks very good. See the 2nd image for the one that I already have hanging on my other window.. To the seller please send the correct item this time.. üôèüôè

Does not really block much light at all

I bought 2 sets of  one colour and one set in another colour but received 3 different colours..now mixing and matching that will be hideous

They are good for making a room darker, but definitely not blackout curtains. I found that the color really makes the difference on whether or not they are more effective or not. I got the yellow ones and you can definitely see the sun through even at midday when it's not that sunny.

Waited a few weeks to receive these, and while they are nice quality for the price, they came in the wrong size. Disappointing :(

Ordered 2 sets of 42x63 curtains. Set of blue were 2 different sizes and are longer than the set of gray I ordered. Between 1.5" to 2.5" differences. So out 3 out of 4 panels are to size.

My first shipment set was fine. The second set had no grommets or even an opening to slide a pole in to. Thinking it was just a fluke I purchased another and it, too, has no grommets. I would prefer my curtains to match but now I'm thinking I should look elsewhere.

Dirty upon arrival

One set of curtains is about 2 inches shorter than the other, way more wrinkly, and a different color/sheen. One pair is QC 0002 and one is QC0101

Measurements are approximate. Go bigger or buy more than you think you need. Haven't decided if I'm keeping or returning  them. Accurate info would be less of a pain in the a$$

Curtains? Yes. Blackout curtains? Not so much.

I received 1 curtain that was what I ordered and the other was shorter and not the same hanging mechanism on top. Two completely different curtains that were supposed to be a pair. They are nice, good quality curtains, they should match though.

These are typical "made in China" trash items. We really need to stop buying from those animals. They are poorly made and they are NOT blackout curtains. Blackout means just that - no light. Instead, the light shines right through. No point in ever using them.

So I‚Äôve ordered curtains from this company. They all have been the same size, except for these red ones. These are about 5‚Äô longer. I will try and send them back for a new set, and hopefully the one I received was a defect.

These are NOT blackout by any means. Can still see light through them. As curtains they would be nice and a good value, but they are advertised as "blackout" and even with blinds, they are not. I didn't leave them up so I can't review their energy efficiency.

Curtains are nice but it came with 2 different lengths of curtains.

The curtains are too thin to be black out or thermal insulated. Quality not so great.

I am a night-shift worker, so I was looking for real blackout curtains, that would make my room feel like a dungeon. Unfortunately, these curtains let a lot of light through, and the grommet-style isn't conducive to blocking light at the top either.

Package only came with one curtain‚Ä¶ üòí this was my second time ordering I‚Äôm little disappointed

Curtains were ok, but the ivory color did not block out light so had to return.  A bit on thin side too.

I bought these curtains to go in my bathroom, over a window that faces the east. These curtains are NOT blackout

This product says total blackout and they are not. Seriously doubt these are thermal insulation. Very disappointed

I didn't like the material. But.mostly, it clashed with the other color.

Doesn‚Äôt fully block out the light which is why I bought it

Not energy efficient.

Super cute but NOT black out which is irritating since that‚Äôs why I ordered them

The material is cheap I don‚Äôt like it and they not wide enough!

Too bright

Nice rich color.  Good effect; however hemline was uneven.

Color very blue not teal

I do love the curtains but completely unhappy with the color. I was not wanting gold I was wanting yellow, as it shows and say.

Happy with the color being as expected but these are not blackout curtains. The fabric is solid but not a complete block of light. I combine with other color panels that are blackout so works great for accent.

Messing up left and right. product was great. Stillbwaiting forbthe other portion of the order. Been delayed 3 times in a week.

They do darken the room a little bit. But it was hoping it also would keep out the heat. The summer sun makes the room really hot. I guess I just need new windows.

Curtains described as ‚Äúlight yellow‚Äù. Def not, more like mustard yellow/ gold, curtains look like they would be ok but color definitely not as described, so they were returned.

The hems were slightly uneven, correct measuring could have been better. But other than that work like they should.

The drapes were too short.

We really like these curtains. We bought 3 sets previously and just had to replace two (not a quality issue) and were excited to hang them back up but are disappointed in the inconsistent color. We have had the yellow ones and replaced with new yellow ones, however, one set (63‚Äù) is more of a regular yellow (think regular style yellow mustard) while the other (72‚Äù) is a deep mustard yellow color. The shorter set match the original set we still have hanging so obviously there is some kind of issue. While we do like them, we wish there was some care giving with consistency.

Nice curtains but not what I would call blackout curtains they are single lined regular curtains and I would have to keep my blinds shut so will probably return.

Maybe because I ordered such a light color, these are not very light blocking. I ordered the ivory color. Quality is decent, arrived very wrinkled, which is expected. I will be returning these since they do not block the light very well.

These do a decent job of blocking out light, but they are definitely not blackout curtains as advertised. Layering them on top of one another does give the blackout, though! But there is not actual blackout layer behind the colored fabric like usual blackout curtains.

I'm very disappointed by the color of this product.  The color description of "silver gray" should be modified to "muddy gray" because it's quite dingy and dull.  Am definitely returning this product because its color is very unattractive.

I ordered light grey. They are very dark grey. I will use them in another room but I reordered another set in light grey.

If you want something to block out 100% of the light midday, these will not work. They do the job blocking out street light at night though. I'm a little dissatisfied, but not enough to return. Would not buy again.

These arrived with deep creases. I could not get the wrinkles out. I highly recommend washing these before you use them. They were still difficult to iron even after washing but eventually I got the wrinkles out

The curtains are nice, the fabric feels good but my issue was they came 2 in a pack and I needed 4 curtains so I bought 2 packs and when I received them the packs looked the same but when we hung them they were different shades of brown and it was so noticeable. We had to return them for  an exchange.

Just got my curtains thirty minutes ago. First, I saw the spot on the first curtain as I'm taking it out the package and then as I'm looking down I see where the seams are separating from the material. This is unacceptable!! I ordered another that's due to arrive later today. If it's like anything what I just got, get ready because I want a replacement or a refund.Update!I received the second set of curtains later that day. This set was much better than the first. No separated seams in the material; however, the they are very, very wrinkled. Hubby wants to keep both sets rather than send the other back. I really hate keeping merchandise that is flawed.

I bought the light grey curtain.  They do block out the sun on a north window, not sure they would be as effective on an east/west window.  I would not want these in a high traffic area, there are some sloppy sewing on the seams and one panel is not rectangle, the bottom seam is "off" a little bit.

Room darkening, not black out, 3 layers ? Thermal ?  Not sure what happened to the 2nd and 3rd layers, but anyway these are decent inexpensive curtains.  Not shiny material, material is just ok. Light beige has a somewhat of a light green tint, which looks good actually.  Using in a basement room so they'll work.  Probably wouldn't buy again.

It doesn‚Äôt look as good as the picture but good quality.  I like the fabric and make.

Yes, black out and good quality but lots of wrinkles from packaging.  Will be ironing soon and hoping the wrinkles come out....

I like these curtains, but because of the word "thermal" in the title I was expecting something with  a thermal backing.  It does NOT have a thermal backing.  It does do a better job of blocking light from the light outside my window than the blinds did.  In the daytime I can see some light through them, and of course there is light out the top and sides.  Still, they are a lovely color and it blocks enough light for now.  I just don't want anyone expecting something they aren't.

Got two different sets they should of been exactly the same but one set the one panel is about half of an inch longer than the other and the other set we got is about half an inch shorter than the shortest panel in the first set... Not too big of a deal for us because we bought longer than the window and they sit on the floor so you can't tell but for anyone getting them to not touch the floor absolutely don't buy!

Theses curtains have not 3 layers, only one, and thinner than expected- so false advertising. But The ligth blocking is ok.

I order 2 sets of curtains and each were a little different in color and they had different tops.  One set came with the metal loops as in the picture and the other set with traditional fabrics ones.  Did not return them because who knows which top I would get as replacement.

Uneven panels.

Wrinkles DO NOT come out.Says you can iron but you can not. I ironed a tiny corner and it ruined it immediately.I‚Äôve used wrinkle spray and they have been hanging for 3 months and is still insanely wrinkled still.

These curtains are pretty thick and are room darkening, but they are not blackout. They block out about 60-70% of the light. Also, there was a small stain on two of the curtains, but really barely noticeable, so no big deal.

They're ok

These seem like nice, heavy duty curtains, but the yellow was much more mustard than I was expecting. Looking for a bright yellow so these are going back.

Fyi, these are not lined, so whatever color you buy is what the outside of your house is going to be showing

The curtains are the color I needed but there were several irregularities in the fabric. Since I was using the curtains for our bathroom I didn‚Äôt return the curtains.

I'm disappointed.  Love the feel and weight of the material BUT out of 4 panels not a single one measured correctly at a 45" length. All 4 panels have different lengths. 48"/44"/46"/49"

I kept these drapes but they have a shiny ness to them that I personally don‚Äôt care for.

Definitely more of a light grey color. Not white.

did not insulate room from the sun and heat as much i hoped and the curtains are not completely blackout some beads of light shine through

Ordered two sets of the same brown curtain and got one set of the black out curtain and another set that feels silky and doesnt have the rings.

The curtains were ok, but too short for the windows,  I need few inches longer.

These are not at all black out curtains. Definitely takes it down a notch though

What's wrong with this picture?

Cor was different from what we though. Had to return due to being toooo long also

The 2 panels were not an equal length.

White helps lower light but doesn't make room dark in day time

Look nice but don‚Äôt expect blackout

Not as bright red as it looks

Cheap lightweights

Wrinkles DO NOT come out!!!!

These are good for the price. They do block out about 90% of the light. They are kind of an odd length for my window but the window is behind my bed, so it‚Äôll do. Three stars because the material does feel a little cheap.

Had too iron constantly to get iwrinkles out still look wrinkled. Won‚Äôt order again too shiny material also not happy with the rings slide constantly fixing curtains will order rod pocket curtains

So far I like the room darkening and quality fabric. Will see about the heat or cold blocking and noise reducing parts. .One thing I am disappointed with is that these were supposed to have grommets, but they do not. And I need them now to cover my windows so I feel kinda stuck with them. These are rod pocketed and is against the style of every other room in the house.

This curtains do block out the light, but they are not the same shade as the picture and look cheap and nasty. They feel more like a plastic tablecloth than curtains.

I got the black curtains. They mostly block the light but would recommend a liner underneath if you sleep during the day and need it very dark.Fabric is nice, the grommets looked good, and these curtains have helped with my ac in this desert heat.

Got these in the wheat or beige color. They are very nice and the blackout feature is good.  They were kinda hard to iron out the shipping wrinkles so did what I could and hung them. Wrinkles worked themselves out for some time.  Good buy.

I purchased these for a bedroom. The sun sets on that side of the house, heating the room. The curtains do help, but not as much as I thought they would. I still feel the heat coming through them. The color wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, but close enough. It's hard to tell on a computer what color you will receive.

Only complaint is they aren‚Äôt fully blackout curtains but the color and texture is perfect, I expected the grommets to be tiny but was pleasantly surprised they‚Äôre regular sized!

Great quality. Definitely a brighter yellow than I pictured but still pretty!

These aren‚Äôt blackout curtains as you see in the picture with the sunlight coming through; however, they do darken the room.

Arrived on time. Wrinkles from delivery fell out within a day or two. Color was good; no surprises there.

They are really nice the size is perfect they are thick enough that you can't see it of them.

The drapes were darker than the pictures showed

I won‚Äôt return these! They just  hang weird because of the thickness.  I would recommend getting longer ones they may hang better‚Ä¶.

nice product for the price...exact color I wanted...but the polyester material makes it very hard to get wrinkles out with a steamer

These came quit wrinkled.  Since they are machine washable in cold water just wondering if I can just use a cold spray bottle of water on them without ruing them?

I was not expecting the quality to be as good as it was for the price. Used these in my son‚Äôs dorm room and they were perfect!

I didn‚Äôt get these to be black out curtains, just heavy enough and light filtering enough so that the glare from the window doesn‚Äôt prevent me from seeing the tv, which they do! Nice color, arrived quickly!

Was pleased with the curtains for the price,  However, the hem on the bottom was only 1‚Äù .  Hems on curtains should be at least 3‚Äù to look professional.

These curtains do not entirely blackout the light but do help to darken the room. The reason you don't see light come through is due to the vinyl blinds helping to filter the light. That being said, I do like the color and like the way the filtering light gives the room a warm feel. The curtains are not too heavy and will easily slide on the curtain rod. Overall, a good buy, great packaging and delivery.

Not as thick as I had hoped/thought

It dims the room but not Pitch Black but it does it‚Äôs job pretty much.

I love the color and feel of these curtains. It blocks a lot of light. They do not completely blackout the light. They are very uneven on the bottom. Luckily the bottoms are mostly covered so you can‚Äôt tell how uneven they are. This is the case with both sets. All in all I am happy with this purchase.

Would purchase again,  however they come very wrinkled

Before I had too short of curtains. Finally got the right size. They block out the Sun, very soft.

DWCN Light Grey Blackout Curtains Room Darkening Thermal Insulated Grommet Light Blocking Curtains: purchased 6 panels (3 sets). They are only one layer, but they do block the light and help with drafts. They look and feel nice. They‚Äôve been hanging for a few months now and still look great! Nice bargain and product! Thank you!

I purchased the "light grey" curtains. They arrived promptly and washed nicely.  They also fit my 40x66 window perfectly (I got the 38x72 ones) and they're definitely blackout.  However, there's a caveat...these "light grey" curtains aren't so light in color.  When I put these up, I saw that these were pretty dark in color. I was hoping that these would be a light, silvery color. I'll keep these but, I'll be looking for a silver-grey color set.

The material feels nice and the grommets are sturdy.  They cover the window well and do a good job of keeping out *most* light.  There is still a tiny bit of porous light visibility in the fabric and they don‚Äôt hang close enough to the walls to block out all light, but that might be a matter of how my rods are installed.

These are almost perfect.  The color, easy to slide on rod, block light, they seem longer that stated length but work fine.  Had some wrinkles but easily came out with light steaming. The fabric is very pretty

I like the curtains and for the price, they are great. I wish they blocked a little more sunlight than they do--I wanted total 100% blackout and these are not but they do cut back on the sun coming for the most part. But for the price, you can't beat it.  The pink is a pretty pink too.

These curtains do block out the sun nicely. They are a light material  but seem to do the job or blocking the sun. They are just the right length as ordered .The only issue I have is that they aren't as light a gray as I hoped they would be. So that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

The turquoise color matched my accent wall perfectly. Not black out material as I expected but after returning several pairs before these I decided to keep.

There are a few spots of sheerness but nothing earth shattering. Works great for the price!

Very soft! keeps light out.

Love the material, color, exactly what I ordered.

These curtains have a very nice silky feel.  They do block a lot of the morning sunlight from my east facing bedroom windows.  I hung them about a month ago and they still have the wrinkles and creases from the package.  I'm going to run through a short wash cycle, then dry on low to see if that will take care of the problem.

These are nice curtains and the color is exactly as we expected. I reduced one star because they are not lined, and so I think you could debate whether they are truly room darkening. They do let quite a bit of light through still.

The yellow definitely darkens the room but I wouldn't say blackout. Especially when the sun hits the window straight on the room still does brighten quite a bit. But they're fine for me and they make my room look really warm and cozy! Do a good job of insulating too.

After washing them they are still wrinkled like I never put them in water. The creases are still exactly like the fold. You must iron them even through the care instructions say ‚Äúlow Iorn‚Äù. Guessing China meant iron. Mine required high ihear n steam iron.

By far the best black out curtains I have ever purchased. This is actually my fifth pair... had to have them in all the rooms in the house.. totally worth it.

My son has been asking for curtains to darken his room, and these come close. We brought red, which are a very nice color, and the room is certainly darker than it was before. It is NOT pitch black, hence the four stars, but they‚Äôre well-made and help a great deal.  I‚Äôd buy them again.

These curtains aren't truly black out curtains.  They go well in the room.  If you're looking for curtains that truly block out the light these are NOT the ones for you.  If you just need inexpensive curtains, give these a try.

Good Value ! My son is happy with the gift üéÅ. And THAT'S saying something. I ordered twice. But not as heavy as I thought it they would be, but blocks out the light fine.

I love it. I like complete darkness which my old (tan) curtain was not accomplishing. These blackout curtains are definitely doing what I wanted. And the color is bright and rich. Great buy, getting more.

you cant go wrong if you play with the colors. Red is aggressive, that's why I toned it down with a contrast color black. Passion and mystery goes hand in hand. I will recommend this brand. it looks classic.

Material seems to be reasonable thick and for all but the most stringent requirements, opaque.  Appears to be well made.  It blocks the window behind me when I do Zoom video meetings.

Prompt shipping. Item as advertised.

The material is nice, it irons easily. They do darken the room completely at night and keep the sun out in the morning, although you can tell it is light out.

These curtains are amazing.  I really like them, in every room of my house but 2 and when they wear out, those 2 rooms will have them too

I received the lime green really bright and beautiful color large round grommets makes it easy to slide open and shut on the curtain rod. Not full blackout but definitely room darkening

These work great to block out the direct sunlight coming through my window when the sun gets on that side if the house. Before, I was getting blinded while sitting at my desk. They do snag really easy, though. Be careful!

Very nice, but look terrible all wrinkled out-of-the-box. Wash as directed, hang with detail, and they look a lot closer to the ad pictures. Excellent light blocking.

This is the color PINK which was ordered. I love the quality although I wish it were a tad bit darker for bright early mornings. But overall, it definitely darkens the room for our preschooler.

Curtains are very nice, heavy and definitely dark. I have mine across French doors. No sunlight coming in there if you have a room that blinds you, definitely worth the buy.

These are the only kind of curtains I buy for covering bedroom windows.  They are 100% blackout.  Keeps the room several degrees cooler on a hot sunny day when they are closed.  Color is nice and the material is quality.  The wrinkles came out nicely with a steamer.  I would buy again.

Not black out but personally, I don‚Äôt care. The block out the light pretty well. Nice color and they look good. Fabric is nice. They‚Äôre light weight, so easy to open and close. Easy to add to rod. They do what they‚Äôre supposed to.

The reviews were mixed so I wasn‚Äôt quite sold on it. I decided to go ahead and purchase and it Did Not disappoint. They have so many colors to choose from and the material has a high quality finish. Amazing price and would definitely order them again. They get the job done!!

Look good and do dark out!  Second set I ordered would take way to long to get here! So I had to cancel and order same set from different seller but all in all great product!

My mom loved them

These drapes were exactly what I was looking for. Our bedroom window area is an unusual size: approx 48" deep and 9 feet wide. (I'm including the rod width.) I definitely needed two packs of the drapes, and they fit perfectly and do an excellent job of blocking out the light. Highly recommended.

I ordered one set for my living room to see if it would really block out the light and it does. The only place the light escapes is the top where the curtain rod goes because it's not right against the wall and anywhere that I happen to leave a gap but I see no light coming through the curtain itself even with the sun on that side of my home. Therefore, I also purchased a set for my bedroom because I have a schedule that sometimes makes me have to sleep during the day and the only way that again I know that the sun is out is if I look above the curtain. Of course there are ways to get around this by putting something over the top. I  don't need that though because I already need to use my lights when I have these curtains closed

My daughter‚Äôs apartment faces west, so it gets the afternoon sun.  The curtains work great, and even brought the air conditioning bill down.

This was a gift and they love it says they don't have to worry about the Sun disturbing there sleep perfect gift

They were true to size and nice quality. I wish you had it in colors that matched my decor. It was limited.

Freaking love these

Was a perfect fit for my window and I love the thickness perfect for my bathroom.

Perfect! Beautiful fabric.  Light blocking.

Not sure why my home came with a kitchen window but it did and this curtain has made it so delightful. Just love it!!

Love these curtains truly black out all sun light.

Love the color and how it keeps the sun light from beating into my living room room during the day ! Definitely helps keep my house cooler

They don‚Äôt have the lining on the back of them but still work to keep the heat out.  Exactly what I was looking for.  No problems when washed and dried.

Great for blackout use in bedroom. Fabric is soft and drapes beautifully. Grommets are easy to hang and slide on the rod.

Despite the price point, these curtains hit the mark for being blackout quality!

I have had these for a year now, and love them so much. I didn't think they would be able to block out SO MUCH LIGHT. I would buy them again and again.

I really like these curtains. They are nice and thick and have a great blackout feature. Definitely worth the price.

Nice

These curtains work great for blocking out the light.

I loved it looks expensive material I LOVED THE GROOMETS it gives a really nice detail on the curtain very shining thanks!

This are amazing. Really blackout curtains. Look amazing in the living room.

Did NOT have the rubber backing which was disappointing.

They are the perfect color and the perfect length

These curtains were easy to put up (good thing since we had to do it twice because someone hung them backward). They were  exactly the right length for the window. They were a good match for curtains in an adjacent room (open floorplan) and they do an excellent job of blocking the light. The packaging creases disappeared in just a couple of days, so they look nice and frame the window well.

They look nice and helps keep the night chill out

Excellent beautiful curtains I will for sure order again from this exact place Thank you so much

These curtains were way better quality than expected. It blacks out all light and no wrinkles when you take it out of the package.

These are very well made and beautiful curtains. I‚Äôm probably going to order more! I bought the white/gray.. very nice!

They darken and look great on the window

Quality fabric, well-made, but for blackout curtains, I was able to see through them

I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised by these curtains.Color:The color matched perfectly for what I needed. It is more of a mustard/marigold yellow vs true yellow or gold. Which is what I was hoping for. Pretty true to the picture on the site.Black Out:I‚Äôm not sure what people expect from ‚Äúblack out‚Äù curtains, but these definitely block out a lot of light. Enough for a baby to sleep and more than the picture depicts. If you‚Äôre looking to block out all light I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôd go with a grommet style curtain in the first place. And these are not lined on the back...they‚Äôre lined INSIDE. And I can tell you this because an iron fell and burned one lol. So there is a black plastic-like layer in between two yellow pieces. Be careful when ironing üòâMaterial:I had no issue with ‚Äúsnags‚Äù in any of the 4 panels/2 sets like some other reviews mentioned. I‚Äôve had to purchase a 3rd, coming tomorrow, due to the ironing incident so if there is an issue I will update this review. I like the material. It doesn‚Äôt look cheap at all and feels nice. The grommets are also nice.*I hemmed these for safety in a nursery; you can see the length before and after. Likely with the longer length they would have blocked out even more length.

I have very breezy windows and these curtains have fully insulated the wind from blowing through them, they block ALL light out, makes my room feel like night in the middle of the day which is important to me bc i work nights, and theyre like a nice elegant thick silky fabric which is so nice! Id definitely recommend

Feels great looks great really like these drinks

These curtains are perfect in my bedroom, keeps the light out well, & heat in. Made very well.

Material was soft and exactly the size I needed

Very cute and work great

These affordable curtains do exactly what you want. They are true black out curtains and help us keep our house a bit cooler in the summer months. Almost everyone can use help with that. The grommets are well installed. I got the gray and am pleased with the color.

I‚Äôve got 3 windows in my garage; wanted to keep the heat of the sun out. Didn‚Äôt want to invest in blinds for the garage so decided on blackout curtains. These curtains absolutely blackout the Texas sun which reduces the temperature in the garage by at least 10 degrees, if not more. Additionally, when i close the curtains, it‚Äôs completely private from the outside. I just ordered these for my bedroom windows to replace the 50% light filtering curtains I have to keep the lightning from freaking me and my dog out and to reduce the heat of the sun this summer, which will be our first summer in this home. Some reviewers have mentioned an odor on OTHER BRAND darkening curtains. There is NO ODOR on the curtains I bought for the garage. Also, these curtains are so soft to the touch. Excellent value for an excellent product! Thanks Amazon!

If you use the right curtain rod that Curves in towards the wall, these are great blackout curtains!I have one big window and one smaller window in my bedroom and I can wake up on a sunny day and it is dark as night in my bedroom.It's like being in Las vegas! LOLThese are really great if you don't like light to wake you up.And I'm assuming they will help keep the cold air out and the warm air inside, this winter, too.

The media could not be loaded.
                



Great quality, very soft and effective in keeping the sunlight out. The color of the light blue curtains are beautiful and couldn‚Äôt find this color in any stores near by. I definitely recommend and I Will buy again. They are not stiff like some you buy with creases in them. These were straight out the package and onto the window.

Darkens the room efficiently and matches the color accent of the walls.I get migraines all the time and needed something to protect my eyes from the sun (light really bothers my head when I get a migraine attack).These curtains do not mess around with the sun at all. If you are looking for something that blocks out light, get these. They have several different sizes and colors so you are bound to find one you need/like. The only spot that let's in any light is the area above the curtain where it hangs from the rod, but even that doesn't really cause an issue.Don't hesitate, get them.

looks good

Matched the photo for the turquoise! Looks lovely in my daughters room.

I did like them, but you‚Äôre pink is more of a salmon color and I‚Äôm looking for a light pink

I wasn't sure about ordering online because sometimes room darkening curtains can be cheaply made and let too much light through. But I was not disappointed by these. They are made from quality material, and they definitely do the job.Another thing I appreciate is the range of not only length, but width as well! I was able to order 52" width and only needed 2 panels for my large window. Most other brands only offer smaller sizes which end up requiring 3-4 panels to properly cover.

I bought these because I need a three inch rod pocket.  These have a two inch rod pocket -- and I don't agree with the sellers that say, "Turn it upside down".  That's just wrong and it would look wrong on the window.  (Think about a five inch hem on the top and a two inch hem on the bottom.)Also, and I agree with others, these are very, very sheer.

These are stiff plastic curtains -  not "luxurious" as stated in description. I've purchased curtains at half the price that are better quality. Also not consistent sizing (as stated in description) - one panel was shorter than the other. Total rip off. Do not buy.

Sheer doesn't begin to describe this.. it is thin enough to make it look like nothing is there, lol.The material is rough like flax and the holes are too big, so I plan to wash it it Hot, hoping to make it shrink and make the holes smaller.Buyers beware if you need this right away: This order took Two Months to arrive.  The seller just ordered it after I placed the order and someone had to make it.  Seller responded to my inquiry by blaming AMZ, but AMZ is only the shipper and can not ship something that's not there!Update:After one wash, the sides are frayed. All threads came off.

I ordered a pair of these semi sheer curtains for my door, and there is nothing semi about them! Very disappointed in the quality, this sheerness and the feel of these curtains. They‚Äôre more transparent than tissue paper and they feel rough like cr√™pe paper. They‚Äôre definitely going back. They sure were expensive for being so cheap.

Never would have I thought myself a fabric snob. It's apparently been made official after trying these semi-sheer drapes. I can find nothing redeeming about them except the nice finishing and consistent length. These drapes can be hung in the correct rod pocket and still reach the floor. Would you want to touch or look at any other part of them? Not me! They're cloudy, scratchy, and the texture literally looks (and feels!) like a burlap sack. I bought these due to the nice reviews, but IMHO these are no better than the single-digit price panel pairs!

Wrong color . One side 1.5 inches bigger than the other. Looks terrible . Complete garbage.

These are not sheers, more like gauze material!!!! YUCK

I had to purchase two packages to fit my window. The length of the first two panels almost matched. But the second set didn't measure up nor were they even equal in length. Very frustrating. we're trying to cover our windows economically but this is a recurring problem. Unless you custom make your curtains, this is a problem with any ready made panels from China.**UPDATE**I ordered again the same product hoping it would actually be the length it was supposed to be. Received it promptly [thanks Amazon] but incredibly, these panels don't even have headers. Thought the order may have been filled wrong, but the packaging pictured was what I ordered, the product however inside was not. No quality control at all.

For sheer curtains, the material to me feels like it‚Äôs made out of a potato sack. Rough, not like my other sheer curtains.

These have to be the worst privacy sheers I‚Äôve ever gotten. Completely transparent, it‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs nothing even on my window, waste of money

I am very disappointed for the quality of this curtain.It‚Äôs very stiff. It‚Äôs not pleasant to my eyes, it has sort of blue tint to it.I m returning it and get another brand.

The curtains are nice, however the 3 inch pole pocket as noted in the description is not 3 inches. The stitching was is at 1-5/8 in mark from the edge. Making the hole itself barely 1 inch and fitting very tightly on my standard 1 inch rods so they can't slide. Could have been a fluke but it was two sets....Additionally they don't hang as shown in the photos. They hang from the very top of the curtain.

This is the first time in my lifetime and I am 69 years old that I have purchased sheers that have to be ironed.  I normally wash sheers and hang them up wet to dry.  These curtain come out of the washer horribly wrinkled.  Even drying them they are horribly wrinkled.  They are difficult to iron as well.

These shaded the patio nicely this summer but I took them down to wash and store for winter, washed them as directed and the material is fraying away from the grommets!!!???I feel very ripped off!üò°

These sheers are just ok, not great. You can tell they‚Äôre a bit cheaply made.  I ordered two identical pairs of these sheers for privacy and decor purposes-to use behind my heavier curtains in the bathroom. I received two pair, but one set was the wrong length... about 16 inches shorter so it was very obvious.  It is too much trouble and money to send back so I will give them away. I will not order from this company again.

Unbelievable, one panel was completely shredded. Run run away. I have two more packages to check but this is the first one I opened ü§¨ they were all shredded!!

When I opened these up it looked as if they came from a dollar store. I was disappointed for sure. I was expecting more a curtain and not something that looked like a sheet. They need to rewrite how they advertise these!!

not good quality or material

This isn‚Äôt a polyester blend; but 100% polyester.  The material is stiff, wrinkled and hangs terribly.

I received a curtain that must have been returned that included hair and dirt.

They are all one color and very short light blue sheer not darker on ends

Description says linen tag on curtains says 100% polyester

These were horrible! It‚Äôs rare for me to dislike an Amazon product, but these are not good quality. Save your money!

I ORDERED 3 SETS THESE SHEERS , 2 SETS CAME AS ORDERED 60X 80 , I SET CAME & WAS DARKER & 30 INCHES TO SHORT ,

To short reordered more plus extra 2 sets and there to short ! I‚Äôll use one set of reorder the other two are going back I need at least 84 inch in the black out brown I brought

Looks nice but large 8‚Äù tear / rip on a fold. I did not see it at first until they were up and spread out. I order a replacement set from another place and using these until they come in.

Black dot stains on the white sheers... love them but upset about the stains... instead of returning them I decided to wash them hoping the stains would come out,  no such luck üòî I  also purchased 2 red sets and love them!

Rod pocket stitching was undone, a foot from the end.  Also bunched up weaving on panels.  I bought six panels.  Two were bad right out of the box.

I knew it was sheer but I was still hoping the black ones would be a little darker. It's completely see through and not what I expected. Too much of a hassle to return via Amazon so I'll find some use for them. Fast shipping though.

Gross that they would wrap things up with what looks like somebody‚Äôs dried blood from the factory on my white curtains is extremely disappointing

Does not block any light.

Sheers were torn where cardboard was touching it in package

These curtains are awful very rough not what I was expecting! Would never recommend them!

We only received one half of the order.  I ordered two pairs.  I received one pair of the sheers.

Material was awful & color looked almost Black! Terrible!!!

Not was expecting

They were absolutely horrible they were wet coming out of the package and had green mold on them !  They were GROUSE!

I bought them to the length I wanted them but they were a lot shorter and very thick. I dont like them at all...

When they arrived they were horribly snagged Im several places.

Didn‚Äôt offer much privacy. Wrinkly.

Came damaged

Fabric is very thin and flimsy, like gauze. Requested next-day return pickup on December 23rd, and still waiting on December 28.

These sheers feel like sandpaper. I do not recommend.

Cheap and extremely see through

Not happy with the color was not a navy blue had to order different pair

These are nothing like the photo. Cheap. The rod holes aren‚Äôt the same, they‚Äôre terrible.

Perfect length, but the material..... They were very stiff looking and did not compliment my kitchen window. Returned.

I ordered rod pockets and got grommets, very cheap material. I returned for a refund

I only received one panel

Sent these back

Not the material I was expecting. Stiff and kind of scratch material. Doesn‚Äôt lay fall right

I bought the "olive" green sheer curtains and I guarantee they, even after being hung, are a "dark forest" green. My daughter asked me why I bought black curtains when I opened the box...

The open weave and coarse texture of the curtains was burlap-like as opposed to my silkier expectations.

I wish they were a bit heavier in weight‚Ä¶

Material

I bought 2 pair for 2 windows but had to use all 4 panels on 1 window due to how transparent they really are. Fabric wrinkles very easily not happy with product.

Pretty color, but I could see right through them had to send them back

The curtain came in wrinkled so I tried to iron it out but the wrinkles are not coming out easily. I would not buy again.

Fair quality!

The color is way darker than shown.  They are very thick and not sheers.  Disappointed.

The white 90‚Äù curtains I ordered came today, and both had several black spots that almost looked like tar. They smelled horrible, and the material was very rough. They were sewn well though. I purchased these because the curtains I previously bought from Amazon were out of stock. I‚Äôm returning these and I‚Äôll just wait for them to restock the ‚ÄúHLC.ME‚Äù brand I like better and are $5 cheaper than these.

The fabric has a lot of body to it and so they don‚Äôt drape nicely to the side of the window. If you want to stack several panels on the rod going across your window they would work fine. But if you‚Äôd like them to stay to the side they will spring back and not stay put.

I bought 4 sets of these sheers and am not  happy with them.  They have wrinkles in them that do not come out when tumbled on low in the dryer.  They do not hang well from the curtain rod and appear stiff.  Would not recommend them.

Nice color but a little stiff.

I was looking for something more silky, this is a very rough fabric and sensual enough to go with the other set I have

The curtains were nice.  They just did not look right with the other materials in my room.

Item arrived on time it is as described but arrived dirty. So not too much quality control

Too sheer!  I was really disappointed!

Too sheer for what I neef

Very thin and poor material

Each curtain received is different, so they don't match.

Weird stiff fabric. Not like the photos posted.  Way too sheer.

You get what you pay for - returned.

Great price. Very sheer.

Ordered 2 sets (4 sheer curtain panels total)The length between the two sets was off by about 2 inches.Very NoticeableVery disappointed

Not kitchen windows sizes

Sheer, yes. But the material is the lowest quality possible. Like a cheese cloth almost.

I didn't check to see where this was made but it was so poorly made. The holes were so uneven i.e. when putting the rod into the curtain it was a struggle and I had to push it an inch at a time which took forever. Some parts were so tight I had to force the pole theough and was afraid it would tear the fabric. Some areas of the opening was large enough and went through better. Please make the opening even. Ty

The curtains were not packaged well and very wrinkled . After washing and drying them they were ok

I ordered wine red curtains and they are a very very bright cherry red. Unfortunately they will need to be exchanged since they are no where near to matching the color depicted.

Even after washing them, they are still stiff.Had to return.

Cheap curtains

These curtains are black and are of nice material. They are wrinkle free and stand firm and not flimsy. The big problem i have is they are called semi Transparent. The black ones I received were total transparent. I put both of them together on top of each other and i can see Straight through them.  There is nothing semi about these. If you are looking for a good curtain these are fine for the price but don't be fooled by the Semi transparency name. you can't hide anything with these on. Even double upped, you can still see a fly on the window or a person. I want to see just a shadow of these.

Material not what I expected

As promised looks great.

They were too  long and I had to cut them to fit.  I was seeking a more softer sheer,  like nylon

Very sheer. Ordered 2 pair. Only received 3 panels total

Apparently I did not read the material details.  Not silky feeling.  They are for the back room so they are okay for that room.  I would not buy them again.

Product was more sheer than expected and material did not meet my expectations.  Product was returned and I would not purchase product again.

I like everything about the cutains, But the panels are no the same length. i thought the 2 panels were $9.99, not !9.99????

One package was open and too dark.  Can‚Äôt use them.

Color was way off from what's pictured, and they're basically see through. However they would've worked fine as I needed something sheer to go behind my other curtain, but they didn't match at all. These were more tan, and I needed a deep, dark brown.

Darker than expected

I was wanting more of a burgandy shade similar to the color shown on the site--it is a more red than color selection lead me to believe.  Still deciding if I can use in another area or if these will need to be returned.

Poor quality

These are nothing fancy, at all. While they are as described I do not find them worth what I paid for them. I measured my windows and not where our hangers are so that is my fault for them looking too short in the picture. I decided not to damage the wall by moving the hangers since I plan on replacing these soon. They look cheap.  I bought two sets since we have two windows in the room.

These are what I would call a rough cotton sheer fabric. I haven't washed them yet though I fully expect to wash them in delicate. They do iron wrinkle free from the package on a medium heat. The biggest problem is that they are not well made. There are unfinished threads hanging and worse yet they are out of true. I have 1/2" difference in length on one panel and a different set is shorter than another set. I have adjusted them because I needed them up asap, and I do have a sewing machine. It would take less time to do it myself than wait for another two sets that might also have length issues. Had they been true, then the price was very reasonable.

Fine sheers for what I wanted. Color great.Only thing is, one set is about an inch shorter.Quite noticeable when you put several pairs together for fullness. Oh well. Not bothering to return, as might have the same problem!Also, unfortunately, wrinkles didn't wash & dry out.Very inexpensive, so what else would I expect!

If your okay with see through thin curtains these are the ones. I love the color but they didn‚Äôt do much. There nice for decoration if you don‚Äôt mind.

Curtains were not an exact match for my existing but were as described by seller. Otherwise they were good

I ordered two sets of these curtains: The 45inch and the 54inch. I like the selection of lengths that are available however the pictures are NOT accurate. The 45 inch set came as expected, with the classic rod pocket like the picture displays. This is what I wanted. The 54 inch set came with silver metal grommets to my surprise instead of the rod pockets. So now i have to return the 54 inch set because it will look silly to have two different styles in the same room. Very disappointed because I was pretty happy with the 45 inch set.I am ONLY giving three stars because the quality is decent and i am happy with the 45 inch set, but buyers beware of misleading info for this product.

These aren't like any voile sheers I've ever purchased. They are a strange texture and material; felt almost like cheesecloth. Before I even opened the package I could see they were not what I was expecting. Opened one end, felt the texture and clicked the "return" button.If you have flowy, silky sheers in your windows and want more - this isn't what you are looking for.

I ordered 3 pairs, 2 panels each for a total of 6 individual curtains. All the same color and length/width. What I received was 4 curtains of one color and length, and 2 curtains of a much lighter shade and longer length. Sigh.. My solution was the alternative the panels and break out the pinking sheers to even the length. Not happy about this, will be contacting the seller... a China seller, so this should be fun :(

Good quality and like the navy blue color but the gather is pretty tight if the rod isn‚Äôt super thin. It makes it hard to open and close it smoothly

Very transparent and thin!

These are good if you want extremely sheer curtains. I need more of a blurred/privacy sheer curtain, and these were still completely see through.

I ordered what is called "Navy" in the text description - My bad partly because the pic in their description looks teal, but, 'was so hoping these would actually BE navy (which is a dark blue, right?). I'm not going to mess with returning them, as I might use them somewhere. BUT I STILL WANT NAVY. :) If anyone can advise correct selection.  My photo added here is the actual color, which is even different than shown in their description.  I dunno, more a light 'royal blue', perhaps.

The fabric is great--like that they are opaque.  However they were described as having 4" hems--the rod pocket top was 4" but the bottom was only 2'.  Luckily they were long enough so that I was able to make a larger hem but it took a lot of measuring to make sure the curtain was the same all the way across.  Apparently they were not a true 54" at all points. .  I had hoped to just hang them and be done but it was not to be.

This was advertised as baby pink, with pictures showing baby pink. It was actually hot pink.

Sheers were not all that good quality and they were the wrong color (Ivory) which won't work with the curtains I'm going to use ( my fault).  Felt the curtains were not of good quality.

Good curtains fit as expected.  The color is very yellow and very bright.  The room they are in is darker shiplap on walls and ceiling so I kept them.  But be aware the YELLOW color is brighter than crayola.

Would have like something more opaque

The sizes are great for my window. Extremely light (like nothing there). Wont trust this to provide privacy. I added another layer of curtain which is also sheer, but is much more substantial than this one.

I was looking for sheer curtains but these are a bit much. The material isn‚Äôt the best and looks a little cheap on its on. I plan to have blackout curtains on top of these - I wouldn‚Äôt hang them on their own. I thought the price was good but I might return them and invest in nicer ones.

Curtains was ok. Didn‚Äôt match what I already had but that was my fault. Loved the curtains

Bought 5 sets, all same size. The length is not consistent among the panels - not even within  the same package. Varies by as much as 1/2". Kept them anyway, since it's not noticeable where I'm using them. They do a great job keeping the direct sun from ruining my new mfg wood plank flooring, while still allowing bright sun to filter thru.

I hate the texture of these curtains. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúsheers‚Äù, they‚Äôre like gauze or something. The color is fantastic and a true red. If you don‚Äôt mind the texture, these are a great deal. But I wanted to use them in a small room and the texture is glaring so I‚Äôm returning them üòû

Like the length  but unsatisfying  with sheerness hoping for darken curtains but I still use and added more curtains with them ok I guess

Love the color and sheer Ness but very crisp. Doesn't hang great, no "drape"

Too short

They fit my dorm room windows pretty well but they don't work as well at blocking the light from outside my window. I really like the purple but considering having to buy thicker curtains so I can sleep better because the blinds here are useless.

Quality isn‚Äôt great. Will not be able to wash for fear of the material falling apart.

These came very wrinkled and only after heavy steam ironing are they presentable in my office.

These shears are very stiff and hard to conform to the space I want them to frill. I washed them and it didn‚Äôt make any difference at all. They basically do the job I bought them for, just basically.

The two curtains were different lengths. One was 1/2 an inch longer than the other and sticks out under my blackout curtains of the same length

They were ok for sheer curtains, but the color wasn't what I expected and I couldn't get rid of the wrinkles so I returned them.

Very nice but very thin also found what looks to be card board sewn into the edge of 1 sheer has to cut the stitching and remove it and resew it myself.

Love everything about the sheets except the hem would look much nicer to have a 2‚Äù or3‚Äù hem.

I just installed this, and it‚Äôs more opaque than you would guess. But it does let the light through.And the fabric is more like cheesecloth than a sheer panel.

These are not the best quality.  They look and feel cheap.  The texture is pretty rough for sheers.  Would not buy again.

First off one was shorter by about an 1.5 inch... if I was OCD I would have sent them back but where I have them hung you really can‚Äôt tell but other than that pretty nice quality.

They wrinkle after washing. Even if you just damp dry. The hems are all uneven.  The quality in sewing is not good. Had to move them around on the rod to try and get an even look.

No dislikes

I have been looking for a curtain that would provide slightly more privacy than a traditional sheer, the product description said these were ‚ÄúSemi Sheer‚Äù so I thought I would give them a try. To my surprise, these are the thinnest, most see-through sheers I have ever seen, I am sure they are going to be exactly what someone else is looking for, but they did not work for me so I will be returning them. The material has an odd feel, but I don‚Äôt plan to stand in my window touching them all day, so this was not a big deal for me. Also worth noting is the white stitching, the stitching appears to be of acceptable quality, but the use of white thread gives the shears a cheaply made look

These were much sheerer than the pics but worked ok as a temp solution

Nice in my bedroom

I bought these to replace my old sheer curtains as they were getting old and dirty. These compared to my old ones are far more sheer. You can slightly see inside during the day and once it‚Äôs barely dark out you can see the entire inside. I like a little more privacy so I will be returning.

The curtains were nice but the white tag was sewn deep into the hem and I had to unstitch and resew so it would not show.

These are fine. Decent quality. They are described correctly as red. I thought they looked burgundy and decided to get them, but I should have believed the description! I ended up giving them away. If you‚Äôre looking for red curtains, try these.

I bought these for a little light filter in 2 of our RV windows.  The curtains are a great thickness, but unfortunately they are supposed to be 54" long and they're probably closer to 60".  If they were the correct length I'd definately keep them!

Not as much privacy as I had hoped

These are very sheer and after hanging them, I realized that anyone could see through them and the rattan shade I had over them, right into my room.  They are well made and evenly sewn, but too see-through.

Curtains are more sheer than expected but worked out okay.

These are beyond sheer. I said they felt like Halloween store haunted house gauze. They look okay but I ultimately replaced them.

Curtains were not the quality I expected. But, they did hang nicely in a spare room.

They do the job! I just needed something light-filtering that would provide a bit of privacy for two large windows at the front of my house. Now no one can see in, but we get incredible natural light. The quality isn‚Äôt anything amazing here, but they‚Äôre pretty well made for the price. No snags or issues with the set I purchased.

The first photo is one set of the sheets- the hem is uneven by at least an inch. The second photo is of the second set and are even. I love the sheerness and material, but only now that everything is hung up do I see how uneven the first set is. It‚Äôs in the nursery so I don‚Äôt care enough to return them. But it is a possibility to receive an uneven item, so keep that in mind if it‚Äôs something that might be a dealbreaker for you. (And no, I did not hang one upside down on accident. Both panels are hung correctly.)

There is something about the material that made me give this a 4 rating. Not exactly sheer, more of a woven design. They are definitely NOT wrinkle free. I normally put new ones up and spray them with water and the few wrinkles fall out. Not these. I think its because of the material they are made of. I had to take them back down and steam iron them they were so wrinkled after shipping.

Nice color and pretty nothing fancy just sheer

I bought two sets for a long window and, indeed, the lengths were uneven. From the same package, the two panels in each set did not match up. However, I kept them because they are cheap, the right amount of sheerness to let light in but obscure the view from outside, and are not too noticeable behind blinds. Beware if you‚Äôre a perfectionist or need them to be even!

No issue with this  product.

Looked for a semi sheer, camel beige color and these work?Hoping some wrinkles come out with hanging a bit

These were the perfect length.  As with so many curtains, once they were hung, one panel had a definite uneven slope at the bottom.  But I didn't care because they were for the garage. I had put in washer at the final rise stage, added fabric softener and then put them in dryer on low for 5 or 10 minutes. Fold lines were gone, no wrinkles. They look fine. One star off because of the uneven length of the one panel.

The curtains are nice and they hang well.  They are very sheer but that's what I was looking for.  I took a star away since they are missing a few stitches.

Very nice curtains.  What a great value.  Fast shipping.  Thank You

Good for the price. Very sheer. Perfect length 84in. Has a couple of creases where it was folded but will likely smooth out over time. I should have went with the dark gray though.

About 1 inch too long but perfect otherwise

The curtains were perfect for my needs, which was light-filtering (already had white blinds on windows) and adding color to spare bedroom.  The fabric was very nice and all of the stitching was excellent.  Only reason for 4, not 5 stars, was that all of the 3 sets were not exactly the same length.  Not drastically different, as I have experienced with curtains from other sources, but noticeable.  Since they were placed on 2 different windows I was able to mix and match so they look OK.

I bought the first two panels and loved the color and the look of them. So i ordered another set to fill the window better. The second set has the same color and feel, but off 2" on the length. :( I decided to keep them but I will have to purchase the side hooks to pull them over. That's the only way you won't notice how it's off the 2 inches.

Lets in just the right amount of light in a large window that faces the bright sun in the west. Provides privacy looking in from the outside. Nice shade of blue, too!

I'm using them, but the color is not true olive. They are too vivid and close to forest green

I bought this product to use with a backdrop,  but there is too much pleating at the top so I can't use them. I will return to order a different style. Great if you're purchasing them for your home.

Just the right size

Very stiff fabric. Hopefully will soften with washing.

These are a thicker sheer curtain which I was not shopping for at the time. However I do like them now. So if you like a slightly course, thicker thread and less silky sheer curtain, these are nice. Hope this helps.

Good product at a good price.

Pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. I'm a big fabric snob and knew I wasn't getting linen or cotton, but the gauzy weave is sheer but not cheap & shiny looking like some. I like that they have a more natural fiber look than a silky poly blend that might drape more gracefully.

I haven't hung them up yet. They had an odor straight out of the package. They say hand wash, as fine linen would. We machine washed in the gentle cycle, and they did fine. Air dried. Smell gone. (I think it was from the plastic packaging). I checked all the seams, no issues, nice and straight. I would recommend these sheers and this seller.

Nice body to the fabric. For hanging they would fit better if they were several inches longer. I had to reposition my rod and tieback due to awkward actual hanging length. But so pretty so I kept them. I tried to load a photo but it wouldn‚Äôt. Sorry.

Used these, (2 pair in navy), on a wide bedroom window.  They are wide width which I was happy about.  Seem decent quality for price paid.  Arrived quickly.  Happy with purchase.

I like them alot, does what I needed them to do.

Super thin, actually more thin that I expected. I thought the material would be a bit heavier but it's really light. They look fine for a bedroom but or a kitchen window because they're cheap and lower quality. I'm using them for my bedroom so I'm not too worried about presentation. They're cute and simple!

The quality is nice and the length was perfect. I'm satisfied with them. I just wish they had them in light pink.

I was a little surprised at how stiff the material was. It almost didn‚Äôt feel like material...papery.  I hung them in my bathroom and maybe they‚Äôll soften up with some humidity. The price is a little high for the quality. I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10.00 or less.

The curtains were as advertised. Only complaint was the odor they had after removing them from packaging. They have been hanging for 2 weeks and they still have odor but better.

I love the material and the semi sheerness. I would prefer a 3 inch hem, but for the price, they are just fine.

Bought these because they were the exact size I needed.  I have bamboo shades and needed something beneath to filter sunlight and protect privacy.  These are good quality at a reasonable price.  Will answer durability when they have been up longer than 1 week and after laundering them.

They are a really nice quality for the price. Perfect accent with my other panels and match the grey tones perfectly. I could not be more happy. I can‚Äôt answer as to the durability because I only washed them once. But the color is perfect.

I was looking for purple bathroom curtains for four months. I absolutely love the color of these curtains. I know the description says sheer but I wasn‚Äôt excepting people to be able to see my getting out of the shower. Overall love them but wish they were a bit thicker.

Excellent

Love the color more sheerness to them than I thought did put them up look nice for spring and summer!

Wanted sheers to reduce but not block light in the bedroom. These are perfect! They look more expensive than they are and we‚Äôre easy to hang.

I love the combination of greens. I always wondered how with these curtains look with my orange gold the beautiful curtains that I brought from Amazon looks awesome. I love the idea of getting up and the sun is not in our faces, we have framed them so well in our bedroom. It just looks like a beautiful picture. I do recommend these curtains that look expensive and are cost effective.

Love the color and perfect size

These are good quality for the money. They are not light blocking. But they do help keep most of the sun out of the room. Good thickness. Easy to install.

very nice quality

They didn't have any wrinkles when I received them, the color was perfect and they were definitely sheer which is exactly what I was looking for and the best part is they fit on my extra wide curtain bars which was the hardest thing for me to find curtains that fit but these fit perfectly and look great they are very lightweight, thin and flowy. I Love them.

This was the exact color I was looking for. It took about 3 returns of other colors/styles/textures to find just what I was seeking. Very Happy!

liked

These semi sheers are a great buy for for the price. They hang very nicely. I will purchase again.

I like everything wish it's was thicker..but sheer are thin

These look great nice thickness not too heavy but not completely sheer, I think it is the texture that adds to the finished look. Much nicer than the cheap stuff maybe found in Walmart etc. They were a bit wrinkled when I got them and I was worried but I sprayed with a lite spray of water after I hung them and within a few days wrinkles were gone. I am very happy with this product.

These are beautiful sheers and definitely don't give off the funeral parlor vibes many others do. Two suggestions: 1) Wash on gentle and dry briefly on very low heat, then iron before hanging. I used a steamer after hanging, but ironing would have been a lot more efficient. 2) Unfortunately, the care tags are sown into the lower side hem of each panel. The tag can be clipped, but a portion of it remains inside the seam, and is visible through the sheer fabric. To remove the tag completely would require cutting away at the seam, and then re-stitching. If you're hanging two panels on a window, I suggest clipping the tags carefully and then hanging the sheers so each tagged seam is on an outsides of the window frame (hanging alongside a wall). The tags will be less noticeable than they would be if hanging in the middle of the window. Yes, this means one panel's "right side" will be facing inside the room, and the other panel's "right side" will be facing outdoors. But the difference won't be noticeable.

As soon as I hung these sheer curtains, I was nervous. I thought, you can see right through them. I was convinced I had made a mistake. So, I went outside and looked in from the other side of the blueberry bushes. Well, I was shocked. The curtains worked perfectly. You couldn't see in. At night you have to close the blinds but, during the day they perform miracles. The quality is perfect as near as I can tell. The folds from being packaged disappeared almost instantly upon hanging on the curtain rod. They fit the window perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I love them. They are pretty sheer but it's what I wanted for summer

Beautiful shade of gray in sheers.

I love these and I always dreamed of the flowing, and light admittingcurtains in my home- at the beach. And these  are all of this and more.Like reported in the product information that these are see through to a point and to help solve this Ipurchase two and put them on one curtain rod (total of four panels together) and the pleats helponlookers to see less- and more privacy for the insiders.

These sheets are a perfect fit for my bay window. They look great with my double curtain rod.

I like the semi transparent I can still see out and still get some of the sunlight they hang very nicely. I would recommend these and I would buy them again.

Great quality and beautiful color for a great price. Was able to upgrade my bathroom decor at a very reasonable cost. I used 4 panels (2 sets of 2) to give a bit more privacy with sheerness.

The curtains are exactly as pictured, and very well made.

The curtains are very good quality, just sheer enough. I also have blackout drapes on each side of my window for complete privacy. They were wrinkled out of the package , so it really will do the curtain Justice if you iron before you hang them up. I used one sheet and one blackout drape on my smaller window to cut down on darkness and bulk.  I may keep these and also try a gold color. This color might be better for fall? I‚Äôm just not for sure. At any rate curtains are very nice. I would buy again.

It's super lightweight. Very sheer, I can see through it pretty well. It is just enough of a curtain to dim the light from shining in my eyes. It allows enough light in that the room Is still bright. I only use one panel and it covers the window the way I like.

The fabric is nice quality, easily hung and looks great.  Not cheap looking.  I ordered two pair for a bay window and ordered another pair to make it fuller to obstruct the view from outside only because I didn't want anyone to be able to look in at night.

Very nice. Needed pressing.

With a hem on top and bottom you can turn these upside down and the height will adjust 1‚Äù shorter if needed. That saved me from having to get them shortened. Color is gorgeous and just like the photo, like Caribbean waters

My home looks brighter and clean.

Is perfect üëå

True to color not too sheer not to dark they are the perfect accent to my livingroom

I have a south and a west window in a spare room and also have  several houseplants in there.I wanted something that let the light in  but not a scorching sun and these work perfect for that, I would order these again.

it allows light to come through while accenting my room with green, it looks great!

I tried Amazon's recommended sheers and they were awful. Cheap material with lots of loose threads and very poor workmanship. They did not hang well. I needed shears for 4 windows in a row but with this product I only needed 3 pair rather than 4 . They drape beautifully and look elegant . Not threads needing to be trimmed on all edges. Hardly any wrinkles which are lessening over the week I have had them.I purchased tge ivory color which is light and airy. The subtle linen look is perfect for my casual beachy look. I only wish I could have posted a photo but unfortunately was not able to do so.I also hung them upside down to avoid a top ruffle look and they look great.Couldn't be happier with my purchase!

Gave some coverage without being too sheer. The color was spot on.

These look really nice. Wish they came with tiebacks.

These curtains are very well made. Very happy with this purchase.

Once I got the correct size they brought out my family room.

I ordered these curtains for my guest room, the color was as notes. The curtains are soft & sheer with a little light blocking. Which was perfect for me, because I also have a shade on the window.

I love the vibrant color and it fits my window perfectly.

The quality of these curtains are great. They don't rip easily no snags and I still have these up in my home.

The exact color and look as pictured. Looks great hung up.

like how quickly they arrived and they are perfect for what we wanted in our bathroom.

Simple, color matched and measurements were accurate. We hung these in our sage green nursery and the color was perfect

Great quality. But darker than I expected. Planning to return. It is not an olive color.  I would say it is seaweed or marsh colour.

Good quality. I am a stickler for stitching when it comes to sheers. Im sending some back because the thread was way too noticible and the wide stitching cheapened the look of them. I hate paying full price for anything, but I still want whatever it is to look expensive! These are well made and have the whimsy and elegance you find in a typical white sheer. I ironed on high heat with high steam and put 4 panels up within 30 minutes. I dont know why it has a rating for wrinkle free. No curtain sheer or panel will be wrinkle free unless its a crinkle style which I have never preferred. Even then there are fold creases. Always iron your window treatments! I will purchase again if I need a plain sheer.

They‚Äôre perfect for my needs and I‚Äôm glad I bought them.

Hmmm...these are nice and steaming them is a must if you want them to hang nice. These are not your grandmother's soft flowy sheers! I did have a snaffoo with one panel shorter than the other by 1/2" but I made it work.

I use them as mosquito screen in my van, attached with magnets, very effective !

The sheets are like a dark chocolate brown - just what I wanted. Thank you

The curtains were as expected, good quality, bright white, just what I was looking for. They were just too small.

I got the white, 45 inches. They are fine. My dog with nasal tumors got blood on them and it came right out in the washer.

Nice weight sheers for bedroom.  I use them over roll up blinds.  So I have a little privacy during the day when my blinds are up and the sun can still light up the room.

Happy with purchasw

I bought these, because I need to block out the sun in my room when I get migraines. I put them up the other day and the sun came up. It‚Äôs shining straight through the curtains. Do not advertise that your curtains are black out and they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs a waste of people‚Äôs time and money..

I opened one package of the curtains i ordered so and there is a dirty spot, I havent opened them up fully due to not being ready to hang, i am hoping there are no other dirty spots.

When this item arrived it was clearly used. The item was wadded up in clear plastic. No original packaging. There was hair and something sticky all over it. Also, the measurements were not what I ordered.

The description says these are "Thermal Insulated".  They are NOT.  False advertising in my opinion.Update:  I find these to be not as advertised.  When they are closed, they are not "Thermal Insulated" whatsoever, in my opinion.

These curtains are not blackout

It is not brown. It‚Äôs more of a gold. Lots of wrinkles. Think it might‚Äôve been a return even though it said it‚Äôs new.

Cheaply/Poorly sewn, prone to wrinkles, and WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE COLOR??I was going to make my own curtains, but for the price, (about the same cost as fabric needed to make my own), I thought I'd give these a try.Pros:Delivered very quickly.Cons:1.  SEAMS already torn when delivered.  I had to repair almost every seam along the top, bottom, left and right-hand sides.2.  The fabric used has a REALLY OFF-PUTTING shimmer effect that causes my "Deep-Blue" curtains to look "Pale-Grey-Blue" or, back to "Deep-Blue", depending on which angle you view the pleat.3.  These things just WANT TO WRINKLE.  Even after washing, line-drying and ironing (just "warm" iron), per tag directions,  they go right back to wrinkled."Pony Dance" Blackout curtains a better deal and Product.

The wrong size was sent.  Over all they seem like great curtains as they would have been just what I was looking for.  However what size I received was not what I ordered.

These curtains filtered out some light, but they are not even close to being blackout or even room darkening.

The white does not block light.

Light comes right through these curtains. Returning immediately as they will not suit their purpose. Oh yeah, and there was some unidentified hair on them right out of the package :(

These are black out thermal insulated curtains in color selection brown. I live in the Northwest & took a nap in the daytime for the 1st time. It‚Äôs sunny today. I also have closed blinds yet the sunshine is coming through these curtains. This is a shame! Too late for refund so I am sharing this with others.

I don‚Äôt know about the other colors but I purchased these in pure white and they don‚Äôt provide and light blocking. They‚Äôre nearly see through.

LMFAO.  THESE ARE NOT Blackout drapes, not even close. The matching tie backs are nonexistent. I ordered the white which would be the least effective. Of course, I know that. However, if the black and blue and darker colors are made with the same fabric, I can‚Äôt imagine they would be much better.I recommend ordering the ones that have a backing, or black backing. Unfortunately, they would not work for me because of the holes at the top.

Repacked in plain plastic so you know someone else returned it and bonus...it came with someone else's hair. Gross and disgusting.

If your looking for blackout room darking curtains these are NOT It. Should not be marketed as blackout!  I bought 2 sets of White for my bedroom and will be returning

The quality isn't good at all.

Highly disappointing. They are thick, but just regular fabric curtains with no backing to block the light. If you are looking for a true black-out curtain, go elsewhere.

I was skeptical that white curtains could be blackout curtains, and I was right. They didn't black out anything. The white would have matched the look I was going for, but I would rather my room be dark then color coordinated. So I put them in the kitchen and bought black ones.

I received 4 sets three of them were cut uneven and had not been sewed the other set was a whole different color blue.

The silver grey color is not a blackout curtain.

Curtains were correct measurements, but not blackout.

Curtain bottom hem were sewn crooked, panels are not the same length. So noticeable had to take them down. Also the panels are different color greens . Company just listed a costumer.

Looks dirty.  They're see through and I'm getting charged to send unused dirty curtains back.

I bought the ivory and it was more of a light tan so I bought these. The ivory had some blackout quality to it, but certainly not true blackout as advertised. I then bought the pure white because the ivory color was so off and these are not blackout at all. I washed them before figuring that out so I'm now stuck with them. Save your money and buy from a different seller.

These were very cute and the perfect size for my need BUT they were NOT blackout as the title suggests. Returned.

False advertising‚Ä¶ the product description says blackout many times and these are not even close to blackout.

One curtain in fine, the other is town is several places.  Very disappointed.

Poorly made and cheap looking not Blackout as mentioned in the Description- It's not Blackout people as mentioned in the description we needed light blue curtains to go with the decor of the room-The sun in the morning shines right through unlike my last blackout curtains that were actually blackout, no light seeps through. This one I highly do not recommend this poorly made and too thin very wrinkled just chep looking horrible

These are not blackout curtains by any stretch of the imagination.

These are a rare find: Drapes made for people who wanted blackout curtains, ordered them, then changed their mind and wanted light filtering shades after they were already delivered. Like magic, they arrive and they aren't blackout curtains.What I'm saying is these are by no means "blackout curtains." Light filtering at best, and when there's light there's heat. Don't try to say they're "thermal lined" either. Maybe it doesn't translate and that's the problem...I have a set from Ikea that blow these away. IKEA! Yeah, buy these If you're looking for a reason to be pissed off and want to go through the hassle of returning something.

Returning because these shades pass too much light through

Light definitely comes in and it‚Äôs most definitely does not cancel noise from out side. The curtains are black though. Other than that nothing on description is true.

These are so cheap looking.  I was so disappointed.  The do keep the light out but it drives me nuts to sit in my living room and look at the crooked hems.  On one curtain, one side is longer than the other.  They do  not move smoothly over a standard rod.  They are too tight so to pull them open easily does not happen.  I just purchased them and will probably be taking them down and returning them.

Right side is our old curtain and left is new. If your looking for a blackout curtain, then continue to shop.

These are very thin, do not block out light or sound. They seem very cheaply made, definitely not worth the price. I bought the beige and color is anything but, it has a pukey dirty yellowish cast like Dijon mustard, awful color, can‚Äôt imagine it matching any decor. Very, very disappointed!

While these do block light, I purchased these because the description says they're thermal/insulated. They are no more insulated than any other thin, cheap curtain you might buy just about anywhere. There's no thermal layer and they're so thin they don't block any sound or cold.I guess they get away with calling them thermal/insulated because the blackout threads block light (therefore block heat from the sun) but they are useless for cold.

I was excited because I ordered ‚Äúnatural beige‚Äù, but the color is not accurately depicted and I ended up with a muted yellow curtain. The corners also turn up.

The material snags easily and they fan out. I didn‚Äôt put them up right away so my return window is closed. Wasted money down the drain. Don‚Äôt purchase these!! They don‚Äôt stay closed on the window either.

The color was like wavey from dark blue to white. I thought I had ordered wrong when I opened the package but confirmed I didn‚Äôt. Had to install them anyway because I had NO curtains. Disappointed to say the least.

I always read the reviews before buying something online I saw these curtains had nothing but good reviews so I purchased them only to receive a pair of sheer long curtains they aren't even the correct size and definably not blackout curtains

On the page it says that these curtains were 4 feet wide by 4 feet tall each which is why I ordered them to cover up one window for my house. However, the blind doesn‚Äôt cover the entire window as it isn‚Äôt as big as it is advertising it is. Yes put them together they cover the distance however I wanted just one to be enough for this window not having to use two.

The curtains are soft and look good from far. They are definitely not blackout as there is no second lining and light will definitely bleed through. When I received mine it seems as if they were damaged by catching something sharp or it‚Äôs just bad quality control. I would look elsewhere for blackout curtains

Not at all blackout, not even a little bit.  It was not a sunny day when I took this photo.  nice tone of orange, warm pumpkin.

The media could not be loaded.
                



The curtains both have lines down them that are ‚Äúnot‚Äù folds from the top to the bottom that actually looks like the material is melted and separating. I love the color but disappointed in the damage to the curtains.

Doesn't block any reasonable amount of light

They were brown like they were supposed to be.  They were definitely Not Black Out Curtains. When I first hung it up I thought that maybe they were sparkly. It was just a bizillion tiny little spots of sunlight shining through. Glad I only ordered one set to try since I had to send them back. :(

does not block light. worst blackout curtain

These are supposed to darken the room and keep light out, well as you can see in my photos, the curtains do not. The one photo with  red showing is in completely darkness, so to speak. That‚Äôs the sun shining through. The lighter photo is obv with my light on.

I like the color.  But when I checked for blackout,  this item failed miserably.  It filters out some sunlight, but not enough for a blackout.  I work at night, so blackout is important to me.  Also, I don‚Äôt want others to see into my home when I have lights on at nights I don‚Äôt work.  Most likely sending it back.

I spent about five minutes getting the curtain rod set up and decided to leave the blinds in three bay windows. I'm glad I did, As the blinds are the only thing blocking the sunlight. I have had to sacrifice two old blankets to hang from the curtain rod behind the blackout curtains. These old blankets, combined with the blinds block the light. But all the "blackout curtains do is blow around at the slightest breeze. The only thing these seem to block is radiant heat, which is the only reason I gave two stars instead of 1. I have bought replacements locally and hopefully they will go up easier and black out the room, as that is what blackout curtains should do. Buyer Beware.

The curtains were nice, color was great.  BUT whe I opened the package the incorrect size was in the package.  The label showed a 53" length but when hung and measured the length was 44".  Very disappointing.

Cheap material, poorly sewn, don't hang well, wrinkle easily.  They're really more darkening than black out. But they came, they hang, and I suppose I got what I paid for.

I'd had the yellow ones hanging in my front (west facing) windows for a few years now, and they were attractive, soft, heavier curtains that blocked light quite well. However, they faded very badly in the sunlight, which had created unsightly stripes and demarcation lines within the folds of each curtain, and I've since had to replace them. I don't know if any of the other colors will do the same, but it's made me not want to risk purchasing bright colored curtains in this style/brand again.

The quality of these curtains is very poor. There are pinholes everywhere. I did not return them because they were not expensive but I would not recommend this product to anybody and they‚Äôre not darkening shades like they say they are.

Received curtains as ordered.  1) Fabric is soft and drapes.  2)  There is a snag all the way down from the top to the bottom hem.  It can be hidden against the wall, but it should NOT be there.  3)  The rod pocket is not stitched all the way across two of the panels.  I am able to finish stitching the rod pocket in place, but I should NOT have to.  The machine ran out of thread and that is why it wasn't stitched.  Poor quality, evenworse quality control.  Label states made in China (PRC).  One would think that China could do a better job.

I thought when I opened the package that they were nice fabric. It seemed as though they were moderately thick, so I didn't really question that they were light blocking. My purpose for getting them was because they claimed to also be thermal and good for heat reduction. I can say that they are NOT thermal at all. I questioned whether they would be because there is no foam backing. I figured perhaps they were treated with something else. I'm not a drapes expert, so what do I know?! Today, the temperature is 84 for the first time this season. That is usually the golden number for heat coming into my apartment. The foam-backed curtains I had the last couple of years worked perfectly to reduce the heat. I should have stayed with that option. I put these up and I could feel the heat coming through immediately. It didn't even need any warm-up time!! I could also see light coming through, so these are definitely not good light-blocking drapes either. Once I got them up, they did reduce the light considerably, but not as good as my old thermal curtains. Because I can feel the heat coming thru the curtain, I know they will be a total fail when the temperature rises to 98 degrees. My advice to everyone is to stick with foam-backed thermal drapes and skip over these plain fabric ones who make false claims. I will likely reduce these to some other function in the house. They do make for nice drapes if all you need is just a window cover.

They darken the room, but the material texture is weird and does not hang nicely.It's a funky microfiber so if microfiber gives you the heebie-jeebies, this isn't the product for you.

We have blinds up behind these and shutter (1/2 way). They are definitely not blackout like advertised. Color and measurements appear to be correct.

Needed to cover built storage shelves in an unfinished and humid basement in lieu of building doors. Perfect for that purpose, the poly would work best for these conditions. Definitely not something I would use, however, in a more formal setting.

The white are not black out, the sewing is not great. I was in a bind and used them , I did add trim to make them look better however would not purchase them again

Let light in.

As the sun heats the curtain our room smells horrible. There‚Äôs a strong chemical burning smell from the curtain. The smell goes away at night and resumes the next day.

Doesn‚Äôt darken enough to sleepLet‚Äôs a lot of daylight through

These curtains are not blackout curtains. My regular curtains blocked more light than these. They also do not appear to be thermal and insulated. Light and heat comes through

Had to return these.  I know that there are various shades of Khaki, but Do not order Khaki unless you like "Tobacco Brown".

These blinds are not blackout. They seal up with the window pretty well however the curtains themselves let a bunch of light through. More like brownout curtains‚Ä¶ just not great at all. They‚Äôre also not very heavy weight like other true blackout curtains.

I ran into the same problem as other reviewers. Four of the eight curtains were defective. Two had small stains and all had at least one slight tear in the material, making them useless. Their quality control is lacking. Other than that, they're nicely made. They're a soft material and not heavy at all for being blackout curtains.

I‚Äôm accustomed to hotel blackout curtains that when closed no light penetrates!These are more like 50% blackout curtains as they only slow the light down! By no means are these blackout curtains! Be advised!

No way that these are thermal lined. Cheap material. Very little darkening at best.

Not total blackout

They do darken some, but not true blackout. Also, not thermal insulated a lot of heat and wind comes thru.

Don‚Äôt get the Pure White curtains if you want blackout curtains.  They pass light just fine.

The fabric is nice enough, but the curtain hangs ‚Äúwonky‚Äù. I would not purchase again.

These curtains are a beautiful color, but black out they are not. If you are looking for a nice, heavy curtain but aren't concerned about them actually being blackout... These are for you. If you really need no light to come in, PASS.

TOO SHORT and thin

I ordered 6 panels. 4 panels were for a large window I have. The large window also has a smaller window on each side so I needed at least 6 panels, or so I thought.  While they do keep out the outdoor lighting, from the inside it just looks like I put bedsheets on my windows. They look very plain. I have ordered some sheer panels with color to put in between to add color and to kind of bunch up the panels more and maybe add some character.  And since I only ordered one panel for each small window the panel was stretched all the way. It looked like a bed sheet so even a small window will need two panels. Oh and this is not wrinkle free. If the sheer panels with color I have on order do not help, I will be sending them all back.

These curtains looked gray in the photo, when I received them they were more towards a green gray. I returned them. Return was very easy.

Likes: These drapes do block the light, and they were made to the proper size and color.  Dislikes: Had to steam the bejeezus out of them to remove the packaging wrinkles that persisted even after washing.  Stitching is straight but very noticeable.  They do not 'drape' well.  Even after some extreme TLC, the fabric hangs in a way that looks uneven and cheap.  These flaws are revealed only after drapes are removed from packaging.  I hate to return an item like this after it's unpacked because it's pretty much impossible to repack it, so I kept them.  They are hung in a back bedroom that gets little use, so it's not that big of a deal.  If your goal is to find a nice set of drapes for daily use in a nice room, keep looking.  These drapes are not for you.

Not effective for black out curtains.

In my picture the product is under my decorative curtains as a liner. My original curtains are very thin so the room darkening you see is the product being reviewed. They were advertised as "total blackout curtains". As you can see they do not match that description. They are room dimming. I have had many sets of real blackout curtains and these are not going to do that job if you need to sleep during the day. The fabric was okay, soft, and the light grey color was as expected. It came with wrinkles from the packaging but it's probably wrinkle resistant as advertised.These are nice. If you want to dim a room they will do that job. If you want nice curtains, they will do that job too. If you need to sleep during the day, find real blackout curtains.

curtains are fine i guess. color is lighter in person than depicted online. looks okay and blocks light okay. a little annoyed that they‚Äôre so stiff and creased and dirty. and the fact that the 63‚Äù sheers i bought by the same brand are shorter than these 63‚Äù curtains. BUT LET ME JUST SAY i am very displeased that i was sent somebody‚Äôs dirty used curtains covered in pet AND human hairs‚Ä¶disgusting! package wasn‚Äôt even sealed. for nearly thirty dollars i think the customer deserves better. i ordered and paid for a brand new product and i expect brand new, not used!!!

Definitely not room darkening.  I bought the grey white, black, navy, and turquoise for a quick fix in different bedrooms of a new house.  They are all different quality materials.  The turquoise has a fabric sewn on the back and it IS thick and room darkening.the others are of varying quality.  The grey white is the thinnest of the materials.  The turquoise were not new and arrived open with no packaging.  I had to wash before I could use.  I found random hair on them.  Gross!  I am keeping them as they are temporary in my new home, but I would not be happy if these were permanent curtains for me!  Be wary!

These curtains do a decent job at blocking out the Sun, but they are too tight and therefore impossible to open, which will leave you in the dark 24/7.I purchased the 45-inch length curtains, yet they still couldn‚Äôt cover a remaining 2-3 inches on my 42-inch windows; perhaps, I‚Äôm missing something when it comes to measurements?Either way, I would recommend purchasing Pinzon‚Äôs blackout curtains (52 inch length) that are much more fluid in terms of opening/closing and have an extra layer on each curtain for maximum blackout.

When I first saw them, I thought they would be good.  I hung one up to see if wrinkles would fall out.  Not a chance.  So I took out the steamer.  Even that didn't take out a single wrinkles.  With the type of material, I hated to iron.  In the end way too much work for an average curtain.  The do block out light. In  strong sunlight they do appear to have pin holes with the strong sunlight making them appear to have glitter on the.

Bummed I have to fix these, since the stiching is not done on one.

So, these are definitely room darkening, but they are not lined or insulated and do not blackout the room. Disappointed that description is incorrect because we wanted blackout curtains.

These curtains were so thin. They were not very "thermal" or "darkening". Will probably be returning them.

You say it‚Äôs a black out curtain and it has little holes in it!? How is that a true blackout curtain?

Were supposed to be noise canceling, but they didn‚Äôt absorb any sound. Although they look good, this is not what I thought I was paying for.

I can see daylight through them. They came in the package wrinkled. A little overpriced.

Didn't get the second set of burgundy curtains and I was very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è

They were not total blackout as advertised, but they are nicely sewn and onlooker good. I returned them as I needed black out not partial blackout curtains.

Very thin some areas are see through and let‚Äôs light in. Darkens the room but does NOTHING thermal. They‚Äôre just dark black out curtains. Won‚Äôt be getting them again.

I like the curtains they are decently nice curtains. Except! That they are two different lengths! Which is pretty disappointing and if with them being loose flowing curtains it is still extremely noticeable. Very disappointed.

These have OK darkening- not the best I've seen.Infuriating that the curtains bunch up on the top because they don't have loops to put the rod through. This makes it so we just leave them closed most of the time because they are too difficult to open/close.I do not recommend.

The stitching is not very good - I am using it in a spare room - so I restitched it. I guess I will be happy if it lasts thru the next 6 months - price and how quickly it shipped were great! With the virus going my options weren‚Äôt the best. Would I buy it again - No

i reall love the curtain but i didnt get right size that i ordered..63"

Liked the pink color but did not darken room as much as I wish it would have. They were not easy to open at all due to how they were installed through the rodGood length - light weight

Liked these curtains and noticed they had a used-like new option. When I opened them the curtains had little black hairs all over one side. No fault to the actual product but not happy with amazon‚Äôs quality control

Let me save you some time. They are not a black out or thick as they are advertised. I got the light grey and they still let a. Lot of light in so :/

The curtains are a bit thin, but okay.

Ya get what ya pay for

I was looking for some white curtains to put up behind my sheer set to help keep out the summer sun, but you can actually see the plants I have on the windowsill right through them. I definitely did not think they would be total blackout, but I was not expecting to see right through them.To be fair, they did arrive quickly, wrinkle-free, and packaged well. They did not stink and the material is very soft.I'm just going to either donate these or repurpose the fabric since the material is just too thin for the curtain I'm looking for.

These do what they say. It definitely keeps light and heat out. However, it looks cheap, likely because it is. So if you want something cheap that looks expensive these aren‚Äôt it. If you want something practical and works as advertised but isn‚Äôt that cute, these are for you.

I bought these curtains because I definitely wanted 'BLACKOUT' curtains for my bedroom. I need to go to bed very early (around 6:30 PM) and during the summer when the sun is still bright and shining in the bedroom, I want as little light as possible. These curtains do block most of the light coming in. My wife and I put them up and it worked pretty well. However, they are not particularly thick and you can see the sun hitting the backing in it. I would definitely NOT call them blackout. I would say they are only room darkening. I haven't had them long enough to know if they will continue to darken the room as well over time. The sun might eventually do some damage to the material after a few years since it is not very thick. But, for now, they will do. When my wife and I first saw the curtains when we opened the package we thought we might have gotten the wrong curtains since they seemed too thin to do much. But, as I said, it does block out most of the sun so it's not worth exchanging them for something else at this point so we'll use them. If you are looking for actual blackout curtains, these are not what you want. My daughter told us that it is very hard to find true blackout curtains because many of the curtains that say they are blackouts are far from it. She knows because she has little kids who really need the blackouts but rarely finds what she really needs. So, I can attest to the fact that it will darken the room but don't expect true blackout conditions.

It works for me as I can manage with something that is not quite a blackout curtain. In other words, the light from the window is somewhat slightly blocked and I was willing to try it for the price. I can't tell if it has thermal qualities. But if you are looking for a good blackout curtain that is not it!

Color is still very pretty and we have several of the same brand and style blackout curtains in different sizes (and just the color black) for rooms all throughout our home, but we needed less contrasting colors for our living room and decided to try ‚Äústone blue‚Äù to match one of the living room walls. It came out more like a darkened turquoise and had more of green tints to it than pictured which was a bummer. Will likely be returning these ones, but will continue buying in black and possible other colors in the future! The black shade of them are flawless at blacking out any sun. I will update if we decide to keep this color and put it up in our living room!

To bright

Curtains are a nice heavy material and the color was consistent. Great hems and two slots to accommodate different size curtain roads.  Wish is did a little better of blocking out the morning sun. So if your looking for a true blackout curtain this is not it.

Very nice drapes but not what I wanted. Wanted drapes to actually block light.

With prime I thought everything was supposed to arrive in 2 days. Took a couple weeks.Burnt ochre great color!No weather insulation panel. Just nice polyester curtains. Still let's light through but this is my 2nd order to match windows same room.Hope it works for keeping the place cooler.

They are alright curtains.  Definitely not blackout or to keep the heat out curtains. Nice fit and easy to hang.

Came with a stain on the curtain, would not describe as blackout curtains either as pictured

It is not completely black out. The sun does come through a little, but they definitely help. We have a window that gets a crazy amount of sun all day and through till the sunsets. I could tell the difference in temp in the room after I hung them up.

These are not blackout curtains.  I will be returning them.

They are fine for the price, color and material are fine. They are not black out as other reviews have said but they darkened the room enough to be acceptable. I am going to return because the color isn't quite right and they are thinner than what I was hoping for and looked kind of cheap which they were so not much of a complaint.

I've purchased curtains from this company before. They are really nice & come in a variety of colors which I love. However this yellow is not really yellow but more like a goldenrod color which is fine cause I wanted something different. These were the 63" length & are perfect for my windows.

Darkening for sure... didn't care to much for the fabric, cheap looking.

I like the color, I like how darkening it is. However, after one month on the curtain raw, the thread is falling apart. I can‚Äôt have nice things because nothing is nice.

The curtains are not as thick as i thought they would be you can see sun light through little spots on the curtain i would have thought they would have a thick panel of material in the middle or on the back so they are not really thermal insulated i do not believe they are they are better than the ones i had

Shrunk when wash in cold water and dried on delicate

Good curtains but the color was wrong

I ordered 2 pairs(4 panels). The pairs are slightly different colors and the upper hem is slightly bigger on one pair than the other pair so they aren‚Äôt the same length.

I wanted thermal backed curtains. They don't appear to be thermal backed. I will use them. So, I'm not returning them.

Have not used the product. It is of no use to me I have two windows that are 42x63. These would be great if I only needed one panel on each window. I thought this was four panels equaling two complete sets this is only one set of two panels.

Curtains were the wrong measurements

Didn‚Äôt like the way they looked. They were also not square the way they were sewn.

I like the fabric of the curtains but order ivory and they seemed more like a light beige. Was not completely satisfied.

The caption says Blackout curtains. They are not Blackout but Room Darkening. I work nights and like my bedroom to be like a cave and these curtains do not cut it. They were a great color and are nice curtains otherwise. If you don't need a full blackout I would recommend them. If you want the cave effect I would go with the Amazon Basics curtains which are excellent but limited at this time.

nice curtains. Ordered two sets, and each set was a slightly different color. Bummer.

They're not a pretty as they look; kinda thick; old fashion

There's only 60 inches but since it is in a spare room behind some furniture, it will work okay. Disappointed in the sizing

Second time ordering the same blackout drapes just in a different color they hang beautifully keep the sun out nicely. The only complaint I had I ordered new and there was grease on the top of the curtain

I love the quality of the curtains, they block out light perfect and were the exact size I needed which was hard in itself to find. The only problem is that I ordered the beige color and they‚Äôre more of a gold color, definitely not similar to the picture/color they show. I still kept them to use in the meantime but I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing a different curtain as I hate the color

I bought 2 pair of DWCN Blackout Curtains for Bedroom ‚ÄìRod Pocket Thermal Insulated Room Darkening Drapes for Living Room, W 42 x L 54 Inch, 2 Panels, one in greyish white and one in taupe.  There is NO LINING just simple, single-layer drapes.  The fabric is very soft and looks quite nice,  The drapes are good quality, especially for the price.  Even in the package as received, it says "Blackout, Insulating, Privacy.  The privacy is correct given the thickness of the material, but even with closed blinds behind these drapes, the morning sun lights up the room.  If you just want nice drapes, these are a good buy.  Look elsewhere for room darkening.

I purchased these curtains for my son‚Äôs nursery. He needs the room to be nearby pitch black to sleep. As you can see in my photos, a lot of light gets through these. This window isn‚Äôt even in direct sunlight, and I have the blinds closed behind it. I got the dark grey in hopes for an even darker effect, but I am disappointed. The material feels nice, and they look like they‚Äôre quality, but claiming 90%-99% blackout is misleading. I will be returning in hopes of finding a better product.

I'm not seeing that they are blocking the sun any better than any other curtain but they are ok where I'm using them but if you really need the sun blocked, I don't know if these will work.  Maybe a darker color would be better...these are gray white.

Not really room darkening.  The window blinds are visible behind the curtain. Keeping because I like the color.

I got the lighter colored ones and they are for sure not black out. They do lessen the light but light still travels through

These are great and I‚Äôll be keeping themBut they are not the length advertised. They are an inch shorter than we ordered and it was going to be a snug fit so they are too short lol but I‚Äôm afraid if I return and reorder a longer size they will be correct and be too long. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

While not sheer, these are certainly not blackout curtains.  They do darken a room but they are thin and shift easily to a fan or a breeze.  I'm used to black out curtains being thicker and actually...blacking out the sun from my room as a former 3rd shift worker.They are ok just not what I was looking for and didn't feel like returning them to order something new after I got them up.

I bought 3 sets of these. So far...I have only received 2 of them. The other set has not shipped yet. I washed and dried the 2 sets I have, according to instructions, and one of the panels stitching where the "pocket" would be came out. Other than that...they're pretty nice.

The curtains are exactly as described. Same size, good thickness and the color is true to the photo. I have had a hard time getting the deep wrinkles out (from the way that they were folded). Throwing them in the dryer did not work, so if you want these to be wrinkle free you will probably have to steam them.

I was expecting thicker drape since they are blackouts.... they seen to work ok for the light, but I would have preferred thicker or the backing to block heat.

I don't know whether these curtains were mislabeled ,  but they are not total blackout.I put them up, and thought maybe they would be alright, but the first time I tried to sleep during the day it was clear that they are not acceptable for that.Adding to this,  the curtains are nicely made,  nice material though lightweight so there isn't any way they could block sunlight, sound, and provide insulation.  This has to be a mistake in description.  If those things are not needed, I would give them a good rating.

I ordered these first and didn't like the color. The color is a bright gold with a small touch of green. Set them back and ordered the beige/ivory.

So these are nice looking curtains, wrinkle-free, and good at keeping the light out‚Ä¶but they arrived smelling terrible! I tried febreze with no luck and, after 2 turns in the washing machine, the smell is almost gone. Very annoying. Hoping they hold up after this, but short of dry cleaning, really didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

I ordered the brown 42" W, 63" L curtain panels. It comes with two panels. The color was pretty accurate to what was shown in the description. I have ordered uncommon name brand curtains before and it was hit or miss on quality. I didn't notice any defects or issues with stitching. I did wash on delicate before installing and they held up great. Out of the dryer they still had a slight wrinkle but not as bad as I was anticipating. I ironed them on low and they look fantastic. They are very soft to the touch and not super heavy. I would recommend and/or purchase again for other windows in my house. They block out the light considerably, so I'm pleased with them. However, I ordered a dark color so unsure how a lighter color would block out the light. The fabric appears to be the same on the front and back so there is no different fabric applied to the back that I can tell for black out.

I purchased the dwcn curtains for the living room and when searching for the right color, was happy to see that dwcn had the right mustard yellow color for the bedroom. These curtains are well weighted, true blackout, and well made. Easy to hang with options with back tab and a rod pocket. I especially appreciated that they work well with a double curtain rod and can easily hide grommet curtains with their extra fabric above the rod pocket.

Very satisfied with these curtains. Color is great for the room they are hanging in. Theyare a nice material in feel and look. Should work well this winter to help keep the cold out.They do block out light if that is something you are looking for.

I got these for our little ones play area and they do the job keeping it darker than regular curtains, they are thick and keep light out. Hard to tell if they help with the heat as I live in FL and it‚Äôs been hot all around. Love the burnt orange color. Size is true I wish they came with a little tie in times when you wanted to let light in but over all worth the price!

I love these curtains!! They actually block out all the sunlight, they are heavy-duty. I love the different sizes available so I can customize all my windows. I have only purchased black curtains but they are beautiful

They look great in my living room. Look really nice. And they darken my room and are thick

TL;DR I bought these in black, many people are complaining other shades are not blackout but the black works incredible and these are awesome for draft blocking! Very mild noise blocking also. Just wish they were a few inches longer.I live in a city and there is a traffic light (among other things) that shine into my window all night. I can see clear as day in my room with just the blinds in my apartment. Also, my windows are drafty AF. Because of the shape of my room, my only choice is to have my bed placed right up against the window.My roommates room is much larger so she doesn‚Äôt have these issues and we were having disagreements about the heat/AC. No matter what they were set to, my room was always too hot in the summer, and too cold in the winter.Not anymore!!! I am truly amazed by how well these keep my room getting cold! I can‚Äôt wait to see how they work in the summer also. I can sleep comfortably again the and the light and noise blocking (I live next to a train) is a huge bonus. Bonus too is that if I get a little hot at night I just have to open the curtains a tiny bit instead of opening my rusty windows lol.Only downside is that I wish these were a couple inches longer. In order to block the draft, I had to set up my tension rod pretty low, and the bottom of the window is JUST barely covered by the curtain, and there‚Äôs a gap at the top of the window, so some light does still pour through although it does still cancel a lot of light. The longer length wouldn‚Äôt have worked in my space since I‚Äôd have to ‚Äútuck‚Äù the curtain behind my bed which wouldn‚Äôt work as it‚Äôs right up against the window. Perhaps I should‚Äôve ordered longer ones and hemmed them but oh well‚Ä¶

I bought these curtains for a room with direct sun and they worked great so I decided to buy for another room. They work fine but the color chart and the actual color were not as expected. Luckily the second color I picked will work but still not as represented in the color chart.

Maybe because these are white, they're not necessarily a room darkener. However, when closed you can‚Äôt see through them.  Plain material, no design/texture. It works

I love the curtains and I have ordered before just a different color. Several different colors, sizes, and blackout also is great!

They do the job!!!

Thank you so much

It not only blacks out sunlight, it makes the room cooler. Size works great for my windows, Love them!

Great color and darkens the room nicely.Came wrinkly so will need to steam them out.Cheaply made material but will they‚Äôll work.

Nice material. Room darkening. Good color.

I bought these curtains to block out the sun. It does the job every time.

I got a 63" L X 52 W curtain which seemed just right for my window size. I got a curtain rod not thick just a screw on type that can be made wider by using more pole sections. The braces for the rod are ~55" apart and the weight of the curtain doesn't really bow the rod at all in the center and I can open and close the curtain sides without any hassle. This room gets way too much light in the morning and needed some blackout, now it has it. Yes they could use an ironing I guess or some steaming or however it's done as they arrived in a nice bag but look a bit wrinkly in parts but I can live with that. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is it would've been nicer had it come with some kind of curtain ties even super basic ultra cheap ones (that still worked) would be better than none at all. The pix tell most of the story. I already had the valence curtains on a cheapish rod so they sag a bit in the center. The darkened room was much better than the camera picture shows, the phone camera made the light coming through much brighter than it is in reality for some reason & I couldn't correct. It's dark in that room. The only light that will get through is from around the curtain edges as something like 99% of the light is blocked by the curtain material.

Work well decreased the temperature in the rv by 10 degrees

It was hard to get a photo of the color, because of the sun, but you can see it where the sun isn't bright. There were small cosmetic imperfections, but they're all on the inside portion of the curtains.

different boxes and different times of the day, save money and use 1 box on the drapes, which by the way are great. samwhatam

These curtains aren't a true blackout fabric -they are too thin and just an uncoated single layer of thick fabric. The still do a decent job at blocking light, but aren't the same as blackout fabric you can buy at the fabric store. One pink panel came with a black streak - looked like a single black thread or something. The hassle of returning isn't worth my time so I kept it. I hung them in my art & craft room which is painted a nice olive green and the pink color is great. Overall recommendation is if you're on a budget and not super picky these will probably work for you.

I ordered 2 sets and one half of the second set didn‚Äôt have the rod pocket in it. I asked for a replacement but got a refund. Now I don‚Äôt know whether to buy another one or get new curtains.

Good material I'd say 98% black out. Will be purchasing more for other rooms. Good deal.

I purchased these curtains to cover a bedroom window. My neighbor's floodlights would come on periodically throughout the night, illuminating the thin shade and disturbing my sleep. These curtains do a wonderful job at blocking light.  They are attractive, relatively lightweight, but they do come somewhat wrinkled. I did not notice any odor.

EACH panel was 70 inches wide!!! I thought I was buying 2 panels that together equalled 70 inches wide. Their ad didn't specify that each panel was that size. These curtains are beautiful and I'm happy with them other than the ad failing to clearly state the size of each individual panel. Now I've got some sewing to do!

These curtains are a must if you do not care for sunlight to enter your domain. These (curtains) work as advertised. They block out all sunlight and with the appropriate curtain rods, you can keep even the corners of the curtains from letting light enter your place. The one attribute I did not care for was the wrinkles. I must have ironed the curtains 10 times before they lost their wrinkles.

Quality of the curtains are great. Material is soft, well made, they are heavy good for blocking out the light. I like them very much.

Material is soft and helps darken the room during the day. I work 3rd shift.

works good

Just what we needed to keep the cold outside & house toasty.

They do let a little light through (Not counting the light coming out of the top, talking purely about what‚Äôs coming through the curtain). Better than non black out ones for sure.

The color works for me, I did my office in Green Bay Packers colors and they work well, they really pull the room together. As far as blocking out sunlight, they work. Wrinkle free, not so much but I don't really care about that. We will see how they hold up to sunlight over time, hoping they don't fade to much. I would suggest these to anyone looking to add some color to a room.

I ordered ivory curtains, but they are champagne.  Still nice but definitely not ivory.

These are so cute honestly and they keep the sun out great. Even after I washed them they smell a little funny, it‚Äôs a hard smell to distinguish. I will just keep trying to wash the smell out. Love the green color not normally something I go for and it‚Äôs wonderful, keeps my bathroom cool now.

They work;  shielding room from sunlight. How, I don't know.  The lining is not dark; yet they do the job.

If you live in an apartment without real curtain rods and can't install them, and you only have the twist type of small tension rods.  These are going to (probably ) be to heavy for the standard tension rod. It will depend on the strength of the tension rod and if something is holding up the tension rod other than the standard tension.Otherwise they seem to be great quality

I had sheer curtains in this room, and it was getting too hot. These curtains let in more light than my other blackout curtains. But they are thick enough to limit and light and heat coming in. For the price, this works. The color is great. I appreciate that they are heavy but light enough to be hung with just a tension rod.

Ok curtains.  Color not what expected.

These curtains do keep the light out, however, they are a bit short. Measured the window prior to ordering so they should have fit. About 1-1/2‚Äù too short.

First I will say, for my purpose, these curtains are good. I hung them in my living room, and I didn't need a total blackout. If total blackout is what you want, then they do not meet that need. The fabric is very good quality. They did come a little wrinkled on the bottom, but for my purpose they are behind another curtain, and nobody can see that. I'm sure after I wash them, the wrinkles will come out. I will say the fabric is nice enough to use as a curtain. The color, gold, is lovely. I will see if it keeps the summer heat out. During this season, it keeps the heat out. I recommend this curtain depending on the specific need of the buyer.

I‚Äôm loving them. They‚Äôre a beautiful Kelly green and  provides good light filtering for the price.

These curtains are made of a heavy satin type of material. I was not expecting them to be shiny. However, they are highly light-blocking, especially with a curved curtain rod.

These definitely darken a room. They are NOT thermal. Thermal curtains have a thick backing, sometimes similar to foam. These are not thermal, but nice nevertheless.

black out nicely and hang evenly

The photo they present is somewhat---and only somewhat misleading in that, the color of the physical curtains is not bright.  Know that they are a tone of turquoise, but not as bright as you may expect.  Don't be disappointed, though.  The fabric is nice and thick. It is indeed wrinkle-free and a good price.  I would recommend these to a friend.

Worth it!

These are true black out curtains without the ugly rubber backing. The only thing I didn't care for is the rod pocket is 2-3 inches. They would look more polished with a wider curtain rod. They are a nice fabric and are affordable.

They're not pretty, and I wish they had more variety when it comes to sizes, but if what you want is something to blackout a room, these will do the job.

I didn‚Äôt check length of each curtain. Each is just alittle longer than what I thought with one set on the rods for my window. I can work with that. I like how it keeps back some of the brightness of the sun when I need it to be alot more dim.

These curtains are better than advertised!We have an outside light that use to shine in our bedroom window, not anymore!Super pleased with these!

They work great as blackout curtains for my son‚Äôs nursery and feel so nice and silky! I have a pair in dark gray that didn‚Äôt fit the window when we moved, so I bought some longer ones in black this time. Both the dark gray and black dim the room similarly. They‚Äôre also very fairly priced!

I bought these to cut the sun in my classroom so we can see the smart pad screen better. They work great, and look pretty nice too, so they‚Äôre a win. They also work just fine on a small tension rod, so they were super easy to hang.

These curtains are very high quality! The color is perfect! They match the pillows and art work to perfection!

one of the best products recently purchased ! The fabric is lovely, the stitching beautiful! They are perfect and such nice quality overall

I do not like a single shred of light coming into my room before I'm ready for it. These do that trick! The material is soft, they have good thickness and are great quality. So many color and size options. Can't go wrong with purchasing these!

Really blocks a lot of the heat and noise out. I love them.

Great product and service.

Bright vibrant yellow color. Brings the kitchen out for sure and pairs well with sunflower kitchen decor

Haven't washed yet so don't know about shrinkage, etc.

I what I ordered and they look great.

These are better than I thought they would be.  I thought the ones I originally had were good but I was sick of the color so I tried these and these are actually better!  They are very soft to touch and really block out the sun.  I will be ordering another pair in a different color for another room!

Very good material

I love how these curtains do block out the light from outside. They are very well made and look great hanging over my bedroom windows. Very pleased.

These blackout curtains work, easy installation, the keep the sun from getting in and allows the room to stay cooler.

This curtain does exactly what it was advertised to do. Goes perfectly with the bedding purchased.

I didn‚Äôt expect the beige to keep all the light out. First picture is with sun shining directly on the window. Was an inexpensive way to replace broken pull down shades in our 5th wheel. They give us privacy and do substantially darken the room! The color is prefect for what we have and I‚Äôm overall very happy.

Very pretty and great dark out curtains!

We liked the product and the prompt delivery. Good value

If you're looking for blackout drapes, these are the ones to purchase.

this side of the house faces the sun all day, so it gets hot. it‚Äôs also our bathroom and the window is see through. we needed something thick so people couldn‚Äôt see in and thick enough to keep the light out. it has helped so much keep this room cooled down

Love these curtains! I ironed them straight out of the package because of the folding lines in them. As I was ironing, I was like, these are a nice quality material. They‚Äôre heavy but not too heavy. I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were going to make the room dark enough in the mornings with them being the light yellow color, but they work great! The picture I‚Äôve attached shows one window brighter. That‚Äôs where the morning sun comes in, and it‚Äôs still dark in the room. They‚Äôre not blackout, but most definitely dark enough. I highly recommend. In fact, I purchased these in brown as well for a different bedroom.

These are very nice and i love the color!

I like that the curtains are heavier than I expected. They are very nice for the price.

Beautiful just the right color of turquoise for living room

Great quality. Blocks sunlight

These are very nice, luxurious feel with just the perfect darkness needed! So easy to hang!

I bought the navy blue color for my bathroom window which gets intense morning sun and really heats up the upstairs on warm days. The curtains are true blackout and really help with temperature control. For now I used the existing curtain rod that was there, but have purchased a wider one which I think will let them hang a little nicer. Will update the post with a picture once that‚Äôs installed.

The black ones are great I have a pretty big window so this is 2 sets 4 curtains in all

I absolutely love these curtains!  The material is so soft and the blackout effect is great!  Highly recommend them!!

Good but definitely blocks out the sunlight and helps keep the room cool in the rooms that the sun beats on.

Darkens room nicely. Nice quality/color.

These are more satin that I thought they would be, however they do indeed black out my room perfectly. I‚Äôm a night shifter so I‚Äôve been in the hunt for blackout curtains that would actually do what they say. These are a nice thick curtain and the size is great!

I got the dark brown and hung them so they practically touch the ceiling.  They work great at keeping the bedroom dark all night and in the morning until I wake up.

Good

Worked out nicely. Nice material.

They are very plain but if all you want is black out curtains, these will do what you need perfectly.

These are so good at blockingOut the light I can‚Äôt ever tellIf it‚Äôs night or day outside!! LOVE THEM

I have these on a regular curtain rod and they look great. They are in a spare bedroom/tv room so they work perfectly when you want it dark for sleeping or watching tv. When I want to let light in I either open them up or tie them back with a sash I had.

worthless ..a bedsheet will work just as well..I at least thought it would come with a rod to hang them up. You do truly get what you pay for on Amazon...i literally could use an old bed sheet and fold it in half, and throw it up there

I needed a thermal blackout curtain for a sidelight window at front door where the sun is very intense. I received a double ply light fabric curtain. I could see light shining through it. To add insult to injury the curtain had pulled threads and stained spots.  This product is not at all as advertised and is going back immediately.

Disliked the color , dislike the sheer , disliked the most  the stains it came with . Maybe I got a bad order  . However , I will be returning .

Looked so tacky. I was quick to return it.

Its a glorified table cloth. Completely garbage.

The first time I ordered I only received the mounting hardware. The replacement I ordered was only the curtain no mounting hardware. The mounting hardware I received the first time is too small for the curtain I received for the replacement

Advertised as "Blackout curtain", not black out at all! don't buy if you need them to block out light. Very cheap fabric.

Item came used and dirty with hair and food attached to it also didnt come with tie back!!! Very unprofessional!!!! Returning!!!

Did not meet my desired expectations.  Dated and a bygone era.

These curtains are not black out curtains. You can see right through them they were listed as thermal lined black out curtains perit is a single layer of fabric. Recommend these if you are looking for something to block heat on your French doors.

Do not block light at all . The curtains look great but are not blackout or thermal . Very disappointing. Will have to try another brand . Bought them in advance of need so stuck with them now .

Cheaply made the curtains had frays. You could also see the seams that were also uneven.

They were supposed to be 72 inches in length- One was 72 inches and one was 74 inches - I measured because I could not understand why one looked great on my French door and the other was was baggy

These are the worst light blocking curtains ever. They have no lining and just a very thin material that blocks no light. Not at all. Not even a little.

Picture is completely deceiving. It‚Äôs a flat cheap looking fabric that does not have perfect ruffles. Wife said no, and it‚Äôs in the trash. Maybe for a college dorm?

I bought 2 of these and in the listing, it clearly says it includes a rod. However the package came and there is no rod. I'll be returning,

Very cheap-like curtains don't be fooled by the image. There are no creases . It's flat and resembles a sheet . Nothing fancy nor French about it.

Material not suitable. Looked horrible on door. Very thick and awkward. Returned product promptly.

The product had two labels of ‚Äúgreyish white‚Äù but was yellow.

I purchased the grayish white and they did not keep the light from coming into our bedroom. I purchased these so my newborn could have a dark room to sleep in but these were no help. I returned them the same day I got them.

Terrible quality. They look very ugly

It is not as shown in the photos. But good quality

Material will stain and tear easily.

The curtains fit the windows perfectly. I like the color. I don‚Äôt like the fabric, quality is poor.

Truly false advertising. The images imply that it's triple layer blackout fabric. These are not blackout whatsoever!

Flaws in material, bad product

if anyone buys these for more than $2 and uses them for anything other than toilet paper they are not worth it

This was VERY cheaply made and they look tacky.

The curtains had a very dark backing which would look bad from the outside.

The color was wrong abd they did not fit door to big. But i found some other ones on amazon they fit great look great

Measure your window before you buy i brought the wrong size the curtains are big like a blanket

The curtain panel itself is fine. But the product description says it includes a tie back strip. Mine did NOT arrive with one. I only received the panel itself.

These are good quality although mine came 3 inches too long than stated. They are a little to shiny for my taste also very satin like.

I like the white curtain but I‚Äôm glad I only bought one panel instead of 4. They are definitely not black out.

It gave the coverage I wanted but the color does not match the picture.

Very pretty curtain, but I need a blackout curtain. It said it was but the light was still coming in. I did get the pure white and that may be the reason.

The fabric was nice and the color was a great match but the panel measurements were not as described. They almost reached the floor even when mounted at the top of the door.

Love the color, the feeling of fabric but it arrived damaged.

We returned the product.  While the material would certainly block the light, it is not wide enough to create the look achieved in the product photo on Amazon.  The panel is about half as wide as it needed to be to create the look in the photo (and the sheer panels we were looking to replace).

Beware note that states dark colors are more darkening. For sure. White is barely light filtering.

In the enclosed picture the right side is this "blackout" curtain, and the left side is the RYB brand "Linen Texture Semi Sheer Privacy Sidelight Panels Glass Door Curtains for Entry Door Front Door Foyer Window Blinds, 2 Free Ropes, 2 Panels, 30" x 72", White".  In this picture it's 5pm, overcast, and the sun is behind me as I'm taking the picture so there's no direct light on the outside of the glass.  While the blackout curtain offers more privacy than the adjacent sheer curtain, the blackout curtain fails miserably to block light.  You can plainly see the light coming through material of the blackout curtain.  You can even make out the shadows of the in-glass grilles.  If you're still reading this, don't waste your money on this product.

Definitely NOT black out curtains. I took too long to open the package of these since we were renovating and not ready for them yet. I have to replace these now as its so bright we can't sleep.

Fabric and color-great, but not blackout.

Ordered 72 inches but the actual item is 76 inches. I read other reviews also mentioned the size issue, this thing is longer than advertised, be aware!!

These are not blackout curtains. I have a severe sensitivity to light right now and needed blackout curtains in my living room. This is not it!!

It's more tan than ivory .  Disappointed and now have to reorder

This is the second pair that we've ordered and they have all been 3+ inches too long. Returning these and trying to find different curtains from another seller.

The curtain is thick, it is wrinkle free and you cannot see through it but‚Ä¶ I did not like it because it just looks so cheap

These are not 72 inches long. Please don't use them unless you want to keep these on your door permanently. Otherwise, you'll need to adjust the rods to fit your 72-inch-long curtains.

the photo is deceptive. it gives the impression they are pleated. they are not. disappointed

Beige looks green in color. Will try the Ivory, hope its true

I thought I ordered white curtains - on the actual order it said white.  When they arrived I found them to be gray.  So I went back to the order and pulled it back up and found it says "grayish white."  They are NOT grayish white - they are definitely gray.  Everything else is fine but the color.

Received NO tiebacks in any of the packages.  Badly wrinkled, and the curtains were different shades of khaki.  Disappointing.

It did not come with a Tieback.  Kind of sucks now. But otherwise it‚Äôs great material and quality.  Would‚Äôve given 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è if it actually had the tieback like it said.

Love the materialThey wereJust to long I need 68‚Äù

This curtain is absolutely beautiful. The fabric is also very soft and well made. Blocks out the sunlight for sure. This is so worth what I paid even more so. Super easy to put up

Looks exactly as described. Provided the finished design I had hoped for in my entry way. Very nice quality.  Would recommend.

I bought these to add privacy on some interior French doors. 25"x72" fit perfect.  The color is biscotti beige.  I think it looks like a light Camel color.  The curtains are made well, and are very functional.  They are not the most stylish things ever, but I'm not worried about that.  They are not "thermal", but are made with a thicker fabric.  I'm glad they don't have a thermal fabric back, because the look from both sides of the door are nice.  Shipping was fast.

I hung this on my back door using magnetic curtain rods, also ordered from Amazon. What a great purchase! Perfect size, color and appearance. The material was not wrinkled and the tie back was made of the same material. Very happy with the quality and the end result. I highly recommend this curtain and the rods if you have a metal door.

Wrinkles fell out fast. They look great!

This is a very excellent item that I needed My daughter doesn't have a door in her closet and I needed this and it's an amazing it's functionable it works very well and it does block the lightning and the magnet strength is amazing and it's easy to install highly recommend it does the job

I purchased the white.  These are very nice curtains for the money.  However, they are not black out.  They give you you privacy and are light filtering.  I am disappointed because blackout was number 1 on my list.

This curtain arrived early and well packaged.  This is a BLACKOUT curtain, which is what I wanted.  Beautiful color and the fabric is soft and thick.  Very well made.  This curtain is also insulating.  Only problem, when I opened the package the curtain was stained on the bottom.  It did not appear to be used and as I previously stated, it was well packaged.  I love the curtain so much and think it is very well priced, so I am going to try and wash out the stain, if it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm willing to try and order again.UPDATE:  Stain washed out curtain up and already ordered a different color.  Great product

Great for the price!! I got the 54x72 in Taupe and was a little skeptical because the width of my window was a little under 30 inches, but it worked so great!! I highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for good quality non-see through curtains for a good price!

The fabric is nice, and the color is exactly like the sample. They don't "blackout" all the light though, and they are very narrow - there is no extra fabric so they just cover the windows.

Good is this is the look you want but it was too heavy for me.

picture is accurate for ivory and it feels soft to touch however the fabric snags and pulls easily. i will continue looking for something better.

Color is perfect and spot on with the picture. It‚Äôs a great product I just feel dumb I didn‚Äôt realize mine wouldnt look like the pictures if I buy the same measurement as my window. So I‚Äôd say the pictures are kinda misleading lol but it is exactly what it should be so my bad I guess. And I‚Äôm stuck with it because I threw away packaging

This curtain is a great fabric and well made but it is described as blackout and the are not. They block very little light

I was disappointed when I received these. They are not blackout curtains as stated in the title. Plenty of light comes through. I bought the white ones. The fabric is nice and durable but they are not blackout. I am keeping them because I needed them asap and they will do for what I need but will not buy more.

As others have said in the reviews, there is no white option that is actually white. I bought the ‚ÄúIvory‚Äù color. You can see by the picture that this manufacturer has no idea what colors are. It‚Äôs khaki all the way. Too bad, it could be a good product.

They were supposed to be 25 inches by 72 inches. They are not.  They are 23 1/2 inches by 75 inches. Too long and not quite wide enough. I am disappointed, but they are temporary and I will be throwing them away soon. They are inexpensive, but they are not blackout curtains. Not a good product.

The curtains are about 8-10 inches too long!  They only need to cover the window and not the whole door!  I would have preferred they were lace or sheer!If you want something to block the window these are for you

Glad I didn't order the 70% blackout. Expected more light reduction.

Definitely not black out, not even close.I have other brands that are "complete" light blocking.  Disappointed,  but will keep since it fits my french door.

It looks nice but didn't come with hardware to hang up

I only received one not two.

Not what expected or shown in picture. Very cheaply made. Poor quality appearance

Great for covering the French door window, but the sashes are not long enough.

Ordered the first time didn‚Äôt come with tie back, was told to send back and a replacement would be sent, I received the package and still no tie back but the material is thick and blocks out the sun. Good quality.

The quality of the material is to be expected for the cost but the stitching was just awful. Very visible, large stitches that were very distracting. I also found these to be far too long for most French door windows- it spanned the entire height of the door.

The curtains are great but not as white as advertised. They look more grey than white but I think it‚Äôs because of the blackout fabric.

I mismeasured so I‚Äôm having to return them but I did like the fabric.

I got 2 and 1 is cut so crooked that it is unusable.

I needed new curtains to help me block out some excess light in the summer, but didn't want blackout curtains. This adds a nice glow to the room but blocks out the majority of light. I washed and then ironed my curtains to remove the folds. My biggest gripe is that the fabric band to cinch the fabric is slightly too small. An extra inch to the fabric band would have been perfect.

.

Looks very nice but smells really stinky needs to be washed

Does what I need it to.  Not quite the perfect size but effective!

Color not as dark as portrayed in photo on line. But I still like them well enough.

these are pretty thick and definitely blackout.  My only issue is with the tiebacks.  they really need to be a little smaller as they slide around.  Now I am not using them and if I do, I will have to pin them to the curtain.  other than that I am very happy with them.

love the quality and softness, most of all the blackout part

Size and color perfect

These curtains definitely exceeded my expectations based on the price.Quality: the curtains are made of a rich fabric material which makes them look and feel like higher quality brands.  Even the curtain ties are made with the same fabric and are very sturdy.  The ties also have a strong velcro so I don't see issues with longevity.Aesthetics: the curtains look beautiful and were exactly what we needed.  For the price they definitely look like higher brands curtains.The only negative I see and must mention is these aren't true black out and I know that might be disappointing to some.  We were ok with not needing black out since it's for our front door. But I wouldn't use these for our French doors to the bedroom because we would need to it be a lot more black out.Overall I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a quality curtain for a cheaper price

It's a curtain, not curtains, only one.

Perfect for room darkening. Easy on off tie back.

Completely user error, however while comparing various curtains, I failed to see this item was a single panel only. However, it is well made, looks great, and I cant wait to get the one I just ordered to complete the pair needed.

Still a few wrinkles as it just came directly out of the package.  Will work well to give privacy to this room.  The length was 4‚Äù longer (76‚Äù)  than stated but that was fine as I just put the brackets lower on the door.  This is a 36‚Äù door and the tieback piece doesn‚Äôt work on this width.  I may make a longer one myself.

Needed to cover the french doors to my room and these are thick enough. It is not sheer at all. It's thick and I love it, it does what I need it to do!

I didn't read the instructions. I want to see out of my door, so I returned them. Complete privacy is not what I wanted.

These are a nice material. They block out a decent amount of light as well. No real complaints other than one of the curtains was missing the strap that holds it open. Comparing how it was folded in the bag to the curtain that had the strap, I'd assume someone returned it and didn't put the strap back in.

This curtain not blackout as advertised in the description. There is no backing, it is all one piece of fabric. However, it is nice quality.

I like this product.  The only thing I wish is it came in more length options.

Great product for this price! First i expected something sheer but the product is actually thick and looks durable. In fact it blocks alot of heat and sun beaming through our front door. So was very impressed. It reminds me of the black out curtains. I can wait to buy other colors for this price. The other plus is that the curtain offers two sections to run the rod through. It was a little longer but the extra seamed section gave me flexibility.

These are great curtains‚Äî-Well made, light-blocking (though not entirely black-out), nice texture; however, the color (Ivory) did not resemble the photos.  Amazon‚Äôs page made Ivory (in all the scrollable images) look like a smoky white which, if anything, leans toward a light gray.  When all available light is shining on the front, at best, I would call the color a dark beige or even tan.  When the light comes from behind (all day long), the color is more of a yellowish gold.  Huge disappointment!

The door panel  fabric has a soft rich feel, allows just enough  light through, gives me the privacy needed at night, and the tie back allows  an outside view when I want.I haven't  washed  it yet, but it unfolded with minimum wrinkles at delivery. The pure white  is true to it's  color.I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Curtains are heavy enough to keep out the light and fit my old french doors really well.  I order 72" long and used the existing rod hanger so it bunches a bit at the bottom.  It doesn't bother us because the main reason we bought them was to keep our dog from barking at outside activity.  I recommend.

Waited to long to open it and now it can't be returned. NO TIE BACK!! Looks terrible without it. Change my review from 1 star to 4 stars and made due with a bead garland for a tie back and it looks great. Perfect color!

Made in China.Would like to have more options of "made in the USA" or any other country, "where freedom rings."

Perfect

The curtains are lightweight,  soft and completely block out the sunshine and any other outdoor light source. Like that the tie backs are not permantly attached.

there great overall but the adhesive they came with is no good. they just fell off when it got colder. so i needed to buy more and replace the adhesive pads. but overall yes there great.

The reason of giving a 4 star is that these are not a given full  sun blocking. I liked them enough for the color.

The lady loved them

Works for me

Bought this for my front door. It's not as wide as I would like but it does the job! And it's perfect for summer when I want the light to come thru when i tie it together. The color was exactly what I was hoping for too!

Very pleased with the curtains and ordered white. They're not white, however, and are more like a light blue/gray color. Fine in the room I needed them for, but if you're looking for WHITE WHITE, these are not the color for you.

The curtains were neat and did what they are made for. However, I had to return because they did not go well with my other decor and the wall colors. But if you are looking for plain blackout curtains for your patio french doors, go for it.

They are dull and bland I'm going to buy some more. My color choice was not a good one the white just doesn't make anything in the room look better. It's a sturdy type of quality and look.

Too long

Opaque fabric.

It is  a little shorter than the window but it works for me.

Perfect

seems ok so far

Beige is more green.

Great quality and good price

Material is nice and thick. I got the grayish white one and it does block a lot of the light making the room cooler.  Didn't have any problems with wrinkles either.

Used these in small bathroom window Blocks the hot morning sunlight perfectly

These curtains worked perfectly for our needs & they were reasonable price.  After ordering 1 pair I was so pleased I ordered them 2 more.

I love this French style curtain for my front door. I have decorated glass and it covers it. Also the rods are magnetic that stick to your door. I get so many compliments on it.

Perfect size for my patio doors.

Used these curtains for more privacy in my office. Love them.

I'm completely satisfied,  the quality of the fabric is everything

I was nervous about the white being a little see through, but I didn‚Äôt have that problem at all. We use this at work to break up the stalls from the lockers and when it is closed there is no seeing through, it is truly black out. The fabric is very soft and actually wrinkle free. It is a heavy duty fabric but not too heavy, so it works on thin or thicker rods. For what I am using it for, this curtain works great and the dimensions given are accurate!

Really brought the room together. I usually need help hanging curtains, but I put these up with no problem! It‚Äôs made well with thick blackout material. Would buy again

Blocks light and easy to install!

The DWCN French Door Curtains worked perfectly for my goors and they perform as advertised.

User lives in the Sacramento valley where it gets 105+. These have done an outstanding job in blocking the harsh heat and light. The tie backs will be great for the winter. Exact color as shown. Excellent length for full window doors. Very pleased.

Great quality quick delivery as advertised

Like the material

Haven‚Äôt tested the transmission, but overall it looks good

This added such a nice touch to my dining room.

This is a great curtain. It keeps my room dark and cooler. It‚Äôs a great tan color. Very neutral color. Some tans I have purchased have been too yellow. This one is great.

I love this curtain! I bought it to put over a door that had a built-in shade that broke. I bought a magnetic curtain rod and put this curtain up. It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle at all and has held up very well. Would definitely purchase again.

Before install: Dog sits on steps to look out side windows of front door and barks at everyone walking down the sidewalk.After install: Dog can‚Äôt see people on the sidewalk, so barking reduced by 99.4%.Works great! üëçNote: Door curtain not included. Separate purchase.

Perfect fit for the door and are the same color as the drapes I bought off Amazon 8 years ago.

I got the olive color and it‚Äôs so pretty!! Make sure you get the right size. You want it nice and wide so that you‚Äôll get the ripples. Get a size wider than what the actual width of your door is. See the sizing chart. Otherwise it doesn‚Äôt look as nice because it looks skimpy on fabric. I got a smaller size first and exchanged it. Made a huge difference. Paired with a bronze rod looks very classy! The fabric is thick enough to where it doesn‚Äôt look sheer. Color is a rich tone. I‚Äôll try to edit later with a picture. If you need French door blinds these are great! Only word of caution is watch the Velcro on the tie backs. Take it off/on carefully so you don‚Äôt snag the curtain.

Look nice, easy install using metal magnetic rods. Wrinkles disappeared after a day. Comes with handy ties for daytime. Nice weight for insulation, and kind of goes with the rest of my decor.

The gray white is a beautiful color!

I am extremely pleased with this curtain, the quality is excellent for the price. It really does block out light, is just heavy enough to suit my purpose. I am using it on a north facing French door to help the room feel warmer in winter and cooler in summer. I would buy it again.

My first order was lost in bad weather. They were fast sending a replacement. I love these curtains they block the light very well and look great!

Bought this for a glass door for more privacy it is thick enough where nobody can see in which is what I wanted

These worked out great for what I needed.

I like this product. Color on point. It was the only one in the  length I needed. I would like them to make one a lil more sheer.

Used these on the French doors of our guest room.  Gives privacy when extended open and lets in light when tied back.  Doors are metal, so I also purchased 2 sets of magnetic curtain rods; they work just fine for an area where the curtains are not opened/closed often.

I love this curtain. It is insulated and also room darkening. I have it at my front door window.  Keeps the cold out and no one can see in.It‚Äôs well made and comes in different colors. Shipping was fast.  Very pleased with this purchase b

These curtain are soft and they provide great privacy. I added a decorative pin to attach the curtain belt since we use these closed the majority of the time. However I didn't want to lose the belt since on occasion we do want these curtains open to let light in. I would 100% buy these again

These curtains are so soft my husband said he wanted to to sew them together for a bed spread lol they are thick and soft and so nice. A+++

I love the material  but didn't like the price for only one panel

I ordered for 3 French doors & am so pleased with the weight & feel of the fabric. An incredibly inexpensive price for the quality. My room has been transformed to a warm & inviting space. I did take the advice of another reviewer & ordered a size larger to get the nice gathers at the top & bottom.

These curtains were just what I needed.  My bedroom has a French door and the sunlight would wake me up early. I installed these curtains to block the light and they work great.

Love this curtain panel very worth the purchase

I like this DWCN French Thermal Blackout Curtain,  it is a little long for back door.  But I will fix the hem.  It is so nice curtain.

They look very nice. Just too thick for me. I wanted light to come through this, but it doesn't. They do look rich looking. Hang well. Just block out sun.

Great product

These were much better quality than expected for the price. The color we selected was brown its a rich chocolate almost satin looking curtain. They have a nice bunching to create a crease effect that looks really lovely on the windows. Thick material and great for an area that needs sun blockage.

Fantastic value and quality! Been waking up at dawn because of skylight sun. While it may be beautiful, I want more sleep! These are perfect. Definitely provide black out ability with the lining, smooth to touch, thick material. Thank you!

This curtain is of great quality. It blocks out light very well. I highly recommend it and would buy it again.

We bought these drapes for our French doors to provide privacy.  At night with the lights on, you cannot see in, not even shadows.  They appear to be well made and durable. I gave a 1 star review for sheerness because they are not sheers, they are black out drapes.We have a puppy that likes to push the drapes aside and look out, and they became dirty along the edges near the bottom. I sprayed them with Resolve stain remover because the dirt looked ground in, and then washed them on a regular wash cycle, and dried them on a 15 minute delicate cycle. They came out beautiful, wrinkle free and no visible stains remaining. Love these drapes!

100 percent see through and cheap looking. Originally bought them to use as a closet door and returned them. I guess you get what you paid for with this product.

The item is not as featured. The curtains  are thin and cheaply made. The color is not as shown. The overall quality of these curtains are poor. The manufacturer has  a different item featured than what is being purchased and delivered to customers!I did not want to give this seller any stars. Unfortunately,  in order to submit a review. The consumer has to  choose a star!

I bought these last fall. I washed them on delicate to get out the fold marks. This is July, I pulled all my curtains down for another washing and they came apart. I did not dry them, I washed on delicate. Not very sturdy. Didn‚Äôt last 2 washings, didn‚Äôt last a year.

I ordered 2 52 x 84 and I received a 52 sue and a 52x96. Initially, I didn't realize that both curtains were the wrong length before I ordered 1 replacement which was also not 52 x 84. I noticed there was another label under the new item sticker, I peeled it off and there it was then true size of the curtains. One mistake is okay I'll give it another try but all 3, no thank you.

These are awful! You might get a good set, you might not, so buyer beware. Cheap looking. One panel is about 3 inches longer than the other. One panel side was sewn/stitched at an angle, causing the width to become shorter towards the mid to bottom, which also caused it to hang completely uneven. Overall, they are cheaply made, and not worth keeping and hanging them in my house. Return process has already started and new curtains by a different company are on their way.

This is my first ever review of an item I've bought from Amazon.  I was so disappointed I had to say something. Curtains are cheaply made. Looks as if it was a rush job.  Can see thread on front of curtain where sewn and not in a straight line. Looks like something I would do, and I have very little sewing experience. I would not recommend.

Wow what a horrible quality the white stitching looks so low cheap quality. The item is damaged it‚Äôs ripped around the metal circle. Just waste of money I rather go to target or home goods. Amazing items are all very low quality now I really dislike ordering from Amazon now!

Washed one time falling apart. The metal rings separated from material.

There was mold at the top of the curtain.

Was supposed to be 60" but only 54" long!  Very wrinkled even after smoothing out!  Should have sent back but throw away the packaging before I realized how much shorter they were than they were supposed to be.

I thought I would try something a little different and ordered theses curtains. They were very sheer, which I wanted, but the material was very cheap and the color was not at al like the picture. They just didn‚Äôt work.

I washed to get the wrinkles out from it being packaged and the material around the rings fell apart.

The curtains that I got are just light grey.  They are not ombre.

These curtains are not what is pictured. The ones pictured have grommets at the top and the ones I received do not.

I received in that was prepackaged and looks like its was usedDamaged packaged‚Ä¶Want a a replacement

Pictures after 1 month used. Don‚Äôt buy it.

Didn‚Äôt expect it to be that bad

Plastic package had a perfect slit that also went through the material.

Item returned

Dislike

The fabric is awful

These curtains are extremely sheer.  For the price they are too expensive.  I had to add curtains in the back of them to downplay some of the excessive sheerness.  The vertical ombr√© is good but that won‚Äôt make them a winner.  It‚Äôs like a poor linen quality material for a good decorating idea.  I brought two sets but you would need 4 sets ideally to take away from the massive sheerness.  I like light in the room,  but these are not what I expected.  Won‚Äôt buy again or recommend.

These were not straight

Not as displayed

Wrinkled and mushed up product- compromised quality and look of the product

These curtains are pretty, but that are not like it shows in the picture. In order for the white part of the curtains to be in the middle, one of the panels has to be backwards. Both panels are exactly the same instead of opposites.

Looks nice from a distance but the material is very cheap.

The gray had a brown hue to it. Not what I was looking for.

The stitching was messy, easly seen on the dark portion of curtain. And the material very stiff.

I do not usually write bad reviews but I didn‚Äôt even get them hung up and had problems. I noticed the curtains were stiff when I opened them. I thought no big deal and I can handle that. I put one set in the dryer on delicate to get the wrinkles out from the packaging and they looked worst than before I put them in there. Then I began to iron them and got to the 3rd panel and one of the grommets were tore and I had not even hung them up yet. I like the look of the ombr√© but they were not good quality at all. I just wanted inexpensive and simple curtains to go in my son‚Äôs room. I didn‚Äôt want heavy and darkening curtains because he likes the light coming into his room which the sheer material would have been perfect for.

Not satisfied as the material appears very second-rate

Color looks nice but you can‚Äôt to remove wrinkles

They are extremely light.  You can't  tell the difference between the white and grey.  Not like the picture.

Although the quality of these sheer curtains was as advertised, the color was not.  I was looking for graduation to black and the darker color is actually a shade of purple. Even my husband noted this and he is color challenged :-).  I am returning the purchase.

The curtains are pretty but they are too sheer.  It's as if there is nothing on the windows.  I had to order additional curtains to go overtop of them.  I do like the Ombre color transition.

These are super sheer! I expected them to be a little more thicker darker and block light our more bit they are cute and match the color scheme of the bedroom they are in. However I don‚Äôt think I will buy again

They were very thin like tissue paper. They were extremely wrinkled n I just did not like the color. The denim blue was nothing like was shown

Didn‚Äôt even come close to meeting expectations. Would not buy again or recommend. Only reason I‚Äôm keeping is because it‚Äôs too much hassle to send them back at this point.

Two left panels were sent to me instead of a left and right. Do not know if this was by mistake or design. Not happy with this purchase.

Not as appeared in the picture - these are VERY sheer, as in the entire curtain looks white because you can‚Äôt see any color they are that sheer.

No where near the green in the pictures. They will still look ok, but I am very disappointed.

One panel width and length did not even match the other. Not very good quality. It was returned.

Not great material. The fade wasn‚Äôt very attractive and covered very little window. My fault for not measuring the width. I only looked at the length

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Was supposed to be the curtains with the holes at top but it‚Äôs not... I paid too much money and received the cheap ones...

They are not equal lengths

Too sheer and cheap looking to me

The ombr√© look doesn‚Äôt really show as a transition

The 'burgundy' curtain is more pink than burgundy.

Cheap quality.

Wasnt that pleased really but cant be bothered to return them now, wasnt worth the money paid feel very cheap

They are cute but they are not thick enough to stay in place. I know they are sheer but they move when with any wind motion.

I like them just didn't realize they were so sheer

This does not look like the picture, it‚Äôs very see through. If someone is looking for something that‚Äôs thicker, these are not your curtains. Keep searching.

Much more sheer than you see in the photos. We're going to be adding a solid curtain behind it to see more of the color. We really liked the orange, but the green is too muted.

It does not look the way it does in the picture,  the color is dull and the material is thin, rough and the creases are sloppy.

Wasn‚Äôt as green and vibrant as described

Although it is a pretty curtain, I expected this curtain to be translucent no transparent. It also has wrinkles that cannot be removed with a steamer or iron.

I bought these for my bedroom, I found them to be too light that it makes my room too bright, not much filtering so I returned and ordered ones with more filtering but in the other hand they were really beautiful just not for me.

I purchased these curtains in March (it is now the end of September). I immediately hung them up and was very happy with them. As summer came, they I opened them up fully. Today I went to hang solid curtains next to them, to cover the window for the winter and so noticed that the mid gray color has turned a shade of brown. It isn't awful, but it isn't the color they were. I bought 2 sets (4 panels) and so I checked the others (on a different window,  in a seldom used area, and this set had not been "open") and they have done the same thing. I may not have noticed as much had I not just purchased solid gray curtains to hang along side these. Im definitely disappointed that these did not hold their color longer.

The curtains are just what I was looking for but quality is bad. They have stains and discoloration on 2 of the 4 panels and the stitching is a mess on one as well.

Bought the 90‚ÄùL the first time and found it too short. It looked weird when the curtains aren‚Äôt touching the floor. Then got the 96‚ÄùL ones.. while it says they are 96‚ÄùL, they are still 90‚ÄùL. Had to return all of them and buy from another brand.But these do look good. I bought these for the two sides of my patio glass doors and added sheer white in the middle. Love the look when it‚Äôs the right size

These curtains are fine for what I needed them for which was to give color to the end of my shear curtains. They are not wrinkle free they wrinkle up all the time and I have to iron them. I could not see using these curtains by themselves they are so thin.

There are supposed to be 2 panels but the package only contained 1!

Gray wasn‚Äôt as dark as expected, and the white part wasn‚Äôt bright white as expected

Nice curtains but have to iron to make them look nice

They were a lot thinner than I expected them to be. May be returning them

Liked the curtains but the are uneven. We measured and there is a 1 inch difference in the length.

Hood length and material was fine it just didn‚Äôt have as much of an ombr√© effect that it showed on photos. I returned it and just got a solid sheet one for less money. It may work better if you combined it with a white or white sheet curtain. Didn‚Äôt have as much of an ombr√© oooj as the photos suggest

Nice but longer than description.  I like them so will use them elsewhere.

Definitely very wrinkled, requires pressing. Not considered energy efficient, much thinner than I expected.

Looks cheap, super wrinkled and steaming them does nothing. You can't iron them either, I'm going to try taking them to the dry cleaners to be pressed.

They look great with no light shining in but they look white shears with the sunlight. They were so sheer, I put a pair of light grey shears behind them. They do look really nice with no light though

These curtain are beautiful but I ordered the light brown but the color is like a light mauve color definitely not light brown  I had to return

Very see through, not good for any shade or darkness. Might work for a sheer layer behind cloth curtains. Payed way too much for these to not be functional!

Nothing

Cheap Quality, doesn't look like picture, doesn't look Gray at all.üò†

I had hoped it would be darker in the shades. But it works

The color isn't as vibrant as it's shown.

Not wrinkle free But pretty colors

Good quality, color was a little different from picture.

These are way too short. They are supposed to be 63 inches. They are 56 inches. I'm not returning as I had knee surgery  but wanted to let you know.

So so so ungodly shear. You can see right through them. The picture makes them seem less shear. Pretty color but that's about it.

Very nice! But don‚Äôt really look like the photo but you should buy!

The item received is just like pictures. I rated it low because the pink looks more of a mauve then pink and it doesn‚Äôt match the room decor. I will be returning them. The package wa since. No wrinkles. Ready to hang.

Not as pictured, too shear.

My package came on time and was nicely packaged, but it was in a see through bag. Curtain looks really great and fade frm white into black very nicely although the black isn't very black but that is to be expected since curtains are sheer. I really love these curtains and they look beautiful hanging in my bedroom but I was very disappointed to discover that 1 of them had a run through the middle of the panel, very noticeable wen the sun is shining true them. This is why I have to give them a 3 star.

The curtains are nice, I can say that for narrow windows they are good, if you have large windows like mine, you will need to buy many so that it does not look very cheap or poor, in the end you try to save money and you end up spending more. The quality is good, it falls well and the color is very vivid and striking, in my case, I love yellow. We had to take the wheel a bit because they were longer than what was provided. They are not even curtains, that is, one can come with a different shade than the pair. The pack comes in 2, but as I said before, they are not leafy and they look poor. They do not block light at all as they are completely transparent. I like them like that

Curtains was nice, I bought 4 my bedroom but did'nt noticed they were two-toned..really was no big issue for I was still able to use them..they actually wound up working well with my sheers..

These are very thin and see-through. I would classify them as sheers.

I got these curtains to go with a new multi blue and white stripped bed comforter. They match perfectly! What I like about them , they let sunlight in some even when closed . So my bedroom now looks bright and crisp. The way the outsides are darker and fade into the white is very pretty. I don‚Äôt think the blues are as dark as the picture shows, but still perfect for my needs. I do really like them!

I was looking for curtains to go with my area rug. These work, however, I ended needing 4 panels because the original two were enough.

I wanted this for my bathroom, to make my shower area look bigger than what it was. I am going to get another color. but they're cute!!

As stated in the description, these are a 'faux linen' drape. Take 'faux linen' to mean 'fine plastic mesh." The tactile sensation reminds one of thin lawn chair webbing, the 'vintage' type that I grew up with in the '70s. However, you do have to be touching the drapes to appreciate the coarseness of the material.Visually, even up close, the ombre is nice and smooth, and the color ranges from nearly-white to nearly-black.They are sheer, but the darker end of the color does provide some darkening quality if hung so that the dark ends meet in from of the window; I have two pair and hung them such that there is dark in front of the window and the edges of the window to give it a squared off and finished appearance.I use these in a child's bedroom, and I think that they are best suited to a bedroom. They are not of a style and quality appropriate for other areas of the house, in my opinion.Overall, I like the curtains well enough and would recommend them as an inexpensive option for a window dressing.

These curtains are really cute and they came in the right size for my window.  There is nothing wrong with them as long as you were not expecting light filtering/room darkening or privacy.  These are SHEER curtains.  They let a lot of light in.  Also, The colors in the picture online appear darker than they actually come.  I was a little disappointed of how light the colors were.  Even though they are not as dark as I would like, I still love the look of them.

Loved the ombre look but was too stiff for my liking,  returned.

I should of checked reviews but I was just loving the ombr√©. It‚Äôs a very nice curtain, I didn‚Äôt know it was see through but looks very nice. May find another curtain as it‚Äôs not what I expected but overall, it adds some definition.

Curtains are really thin, not impressed with the quality

Jason‚Äôs wife here. I like these curtains and seem like good quality for the price. I bought 4 sets from this seller: ombr√© teal (top), turquoise solid (left), teal solid (right), and solid white. As you can see, the ombr√© teal is closer to their solid turquoise. In my opinion the teal on the ends of the ombr√© should be a little more vivid.Ended up keeping 3 sets- turquoise on ends, ombr√© teal between, and white in center.

beautiful but there are cut around the metal rings,I ordered 5 curtains, two panels each. They are looking very nice and I like them but there are cuts around three rings.I ordered replacement for one of them but received it with cut too!

Decorative curtains.

I wish the fabric was a bit softer but that's just me and my weird texture thing. These sheer curtains are better quality then I would have expected. They do a fantastic job at letting sunshine in and eyes out!

The curtains are a lot more sheer and lighter then shown in picture, which was okay with me. The material is thin, so if your looking for energy efficient I wouldn‚Äôt go for these. Still super pretty and looks great in the dining room where I wanted A lot of nature‚Äôs light to come in. Good purchase for the price! If you are deciding to go with grey or black just get the black, it‚Äôs a lot lighter in color the shown.

These curtains are nice, a good length & allows alot of light into the room during the day. Very energy efficient. Doesn't block out sunlight or any outside lighting at night.

Impressed by these: I purchased for my recently update office, which is painted a dark gray (Peppercorn by SW) and the ombre looks AWESOME with my dark walls and white trim. The sheerness is great for a room with no blinds that I would like light to come into, but opaque enough for a room that will sometimes sleep guests.

I love the ombre but wish they were just a little less sheer so the coloring showed up better. Came with creases from packaging but did not have many actual wrinkles. The damage you see on the the left pair is NOT how they came..my cat decided to scratch them (which I am not pleased about). Overall, a pretty set of curtains for the price.

Not really sold on these yet.

The color is perfect

Thing only things is I ordered teal/white but, it appears to be more of a baby blue/white

Good

They look very nice up

Ordered the gray one got the brown one. I didn‚Äôt return as it has a little gray in it but would have prettier other. Looks nice

These are sheer, wrinkle free which is great! There is a lilac hue to these - I don‚Äôt mind it but if looking for true gray to white, maybe not the choice.

Material seam durable, the metal rings to hang them with are cheaply made. Extremely shear, a little to shear for me but they will work for now.

These are great quality especially for the price they are super lightweight super sheer the wrinkles that were in them came right out as they hung up they were easy to install.

I plan to do a room makeover,these curtains are my perfect start. I love the colors and the material of these curtains.

Very nice material quality is very good very share though could see right through traduce eyes and color came very quickly

I like them, not sheer as I thought and teal contrast color almost too blue. Overall,  I like them and would recommend for style

not as shaded as the picture leads to believe but still a great quality

When I opened them I was a bit surprised as they looked darker than what I had imagined!  But, after hanging them they are very nice and lets lots of light in our office.

Fits the window perfectly, easy slide with the ring holes, not really energy efficient as it‚Äôs sheer. It‚Äôs mostly wrinkle free, except for those stubborn few wrinkles. Very nice piece for a simple look.

I love these curtains. They allow the exact amount of light through while still having and adding a lil color to my room with the light going through the linens

Love the curtains, just had one panel that was missing a metal hoop but once I put it up, you can't even tell.

Great for the price.  give windows a fresh lookThey fade perfectly from one color to the next

The color is really pretty! VERY sheer. But the color is lovely.

The product looks good. I would have liked it a bit less transparent. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.

A little thinner than I expected but the fabric hung nicely. Brightened up my living room windows.

Using in my hair studio and get many compliments! Very beautiful

i found better for the price

The curtains are nice and thick.  The curtains are very sheer.

It is okay for the price and quality. Just not for me.

Product just as described.

Bedrooms over mini blinds

I liked the item but the darker color of gray looked too blue for my room.

They are quality sheers however the coloring is not as noticable as the picture shows

Sheer with enough weight, they feel well madeBeautiful

Keep in mind these are pretty sheer as it states. You can tell by feeling, you would need to hand wash these, I would never throw them in the wash, even on delicate. They are a little stiff out of the package, but who cares these are curtains not a blanket! They are super cute and exactly what I wanted.

I needed a sheer summer feel curtain that blends with our chairs, carpet, fireplace and so on. It not only matched perfectly, but it gave a unique blend to everything. Yes I paired it with gray and white curtains. What a great idea that was. The curtain itself is something to look at as the colors blend from army green, to light green to lighter green and finally white mixture. Can I say this is an awesome blending of colors. Love it.

Exactly the color I wanted and I love how the sunshine/light comes through!

Great quality and well made. Worked perfect to cover my laundry area.

Goes well with our ombr√© curtains. Good quality, style & price. Not too silky, glad it isn‚Äôt. Slightly thicker than sheer curtains‚Ä¶.love! Easy to iron out any packaging wrinkles. Perfect length too, 84‚Äù. Will definitely buy more.

Love the way these look in my living room.  I love the ombre effect, looks like you have multiple curtains on.  I paired them with my grey and royal blue velvet curtains for my patio door.

These panels are so lovely in my bedroom. Very relaxing colors.

I love these curtains their sheer which is just what I want since I have the blinds. This goes with my beach theme living room, and I'm going to be changing out the pillows but these are absolutely beautiful and bring the whole living room together from my beach bungalow

These curtains are cute easy to install just right for my room a little see through

The curtains worked out perfert for my vision to separate my basement closet from my storage and gym area

I hung two pair of these on a single rod to cover my bay window, already covered with 3 mini blinds. It was dark outside, and I thought they looked ridiculous. The next morning, I opened the blinds to a sunny day and and these ombre shears really popped! I was so pleasantly surprised at how different they looked! I'm the only one who knows that each side is actually two panels with the white being the center of each side. They look fabulous and I'm so happy with my purchase! I gladly canceled the return.

Love these

The curtains were as described very nice, lightweight, summer fabric, love the ombre design

Sheer and light look for the room. Colors are shown.I did have to put weights in the bottom of the curtains that were close to the heat cent as it blow them around some.

Loved them they look very nice recommend it

Beautiful

I was skeptical about this but when I hung them they were great. I ordered another to fill out the top to look nice.

received these and they are so pretty on my window, Only thing is should be in better package they were all wrinkled and had to be pressed.

Great price and look great. A little more sheer than I thought but really adds brightness to the room

Love Love Love it.... Boost my room to 100.Great buy , very light, same as picture...

Very pleased with these, and the price is fair.Coloring is Just like the photos

Delivery was quick price was reasonable. Love the ombre color grey and white 50x90. Let's in enough light not to much. Matches my decor perfectly. Threw the curtains in dryer delicate cycle to remove wrinkles. Only thing i did purchase another plain white curtain to put in middle to give it a fuller look  both curtains are sheer. Easy installation, would recommend.

I bought 3 packs (6 panels) and I love how it came out. It added the warmth and class I was looking for. I went with sheer so that I could still get sunlight and I don‚Äôt have to worry about neighbors looking through as there is no one that passes my balcony but these don‚Äôt offer any privacy if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. They are light weight and blow in the wind a little which makes me feel fuzzy and romantic while I‚Äôm in the living room relaxing. I would recommend!

Perfect sheer curtains to go between my darkening curtains. Matched perfectly

These curtains are perfect for my beach theme! I did add a white sheer panel to the middle to add more fullness. I would recommend these 100% . They are delicate and beautiful . I am normally very picky with my decor. I was on the fence about these bc of the sheerness. But I took a leap of faith and ordered! I was awed by how pretty and perfect they are! I did take a steam iron to them before hanging. I love that there's 2 panels and there's a dark blue, a light blue and white in them. ( ombr√©) Literally the PERFECT curtains. And I normally Never pick Sheer. I would choose these again and again.. I'd give 5 stars if I could in the look and quality. If you aren't sure, just order, take that chance, you won't be disappointed.

Beautiful  looks like the picture colors are vibrant

With my color scheme I am going with theses colors are Perfect

I love them, pretty

Based on the pictures of consumers i wasn't going to buy these curtains. I hope my pictures give Justice to how beautiful they truly are. I can't begin to tell you how amazing these curtains are. They look best when they touch the floor I originally brought the 85 inch long but had to go to 90 long for them to be perfect. The quality is amazing. Originally I ordered one set 2 curtains came in the set. It looked really good but I felt I wanted a little more coverage so I brought another set, I was extremely happy I did. When our window is opened or cracked the air flows nicely without any harsh wind. My favorite is looking out the window at night... I can see the other apartment windows, but they can't really see into my apartment. In the morning when the sun light is first coming through the window it looks so beautiful and makes you feel cozy and happy lolAnyhow, I recommend this... you will love them. I like the grey, it's an elegant look.

Love them

I love it

I'm m happy to find those ombre curtains, it's what I needed to accent the view of my living room without darkening it.  Curtains are good quality.  I hang up them immediately after washing them in the washing machine, and let the to air-dry and they wrinkle very little.  They looks better in person that in my photo, but aren't as clear as in the seller photo. I'm pleased with this purchase.

They are delicate, shear yet allow in light.

I really liked them but my bedroom windows are very tall and there is a built in ledge as well as the heating and air conditioning vent that sits in the middle of the ledge. So  I tried to pick a length that wouldn‚Äôt cover the vent but the beautiful drapes were too short and I had already thrown away the packaging üòè.So I will give my beautiful drapes to someone that can use them and order them later in the correct length ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Beauiful.  Hangs well and easy to hang. Elevates the room appearance from "blah" to "gee whiz" Perfect coverage, not too much, just enough to cover the blinds behind them.  Absolutely worth the money.  Sizing, color, and description are accurate. Paired with Ivilon Curtain Rod Square Design and they look gorgeous.  Perfect match.

It adds a look of airiness to the room. Really looks classy.

Absolutely perfect for me very pretty, just as pictured

I placed white room-darkening curtains on the same rod to turn these shears into curtains and absolutely love the look.

I love the ombre style and the colors in these curtains! Exactly what I was looking for.

Just what I want it.

Loved these curtains so much that I ended up buying them in a different color for another room

The picture shows the sheerness of the curtains on a rainy day. The blinds are open and when the sheers a closed, I can see out, but those on the outside will have difficulty seeing in.  I am enjoying the embrey affect which goes along with the farmhouse theme and blues in the decor. These are light and breezy for the spring and summer.

These look beautiful, rich,silky cotton , lie evenly, and make the front room look better than ever. I  washed gently in the machine before hanging to freshen & they did well . Still needs ironing but sturdy. I wish I would have purchased these first before I spent $$$ on another choice that didn‚Äôt live up to their expectations.  Great buy for the $$ in a variety of colors.

Love style for bedroom. Soft yet able to allow both sun and moonlight in room. Pretty.

Perfect! They fit perfect and they are beautiful- thank you

Product still in package next to 2 of my blue pillows. Definitely, more on the purple side than blue.

Did not send but 1 panel of 2 panel curtains

No returns allowed. Sizing is off by several inches. If you buy several, expect the color and gradients to vary. Cheap metal grommets.  0/10 would not recommend. All the regret.

I ordered the Chocolate Brown and it‚Äôs nothing like the picture of what it should be. The top is pink the only part that looks like it should be is the very bottom of the curtain.

I wanted to like these but I didn‚Äôt even pull them all the way out of the bag before I knew I was sending them back. I was expecting a more rustic fabric but these had a decent sheen to them and the fabric was a lot thinner than I expected. The color of the dark brown ones also had a pinkish cast to them making them a definite nope.

Expected the 54‚Äù curtain to have the full ombr√© coloring that the longer 63‚Äù curtains had.  That‚Äôs what was pictured but what I got was just a 2 toned curtain that is not the same as the longer length that I have for the same room.

Well, it was falling apart when hanging and when it was time to wash them, it broke apart completely. Not usable and I washed it in my washer on the delicate setting.

These curtains are super thin sheers so I had to purchase a liner so people can't see in my house.  Also, as you can see in the picture the colors are definitely NOT like they are in their photo.  Very unsatisfied all the way around with these curtains but not willing to go through the headache of returning them.

Don't buy these.These curtains feel (and even LOOK) scratchy. There really isn't an ombre effect and they're just cheap looking. Wasnt what I was expecting at all.I'm keeping them because my closest UPS store is 45 minutes away and a total hassle to return.

Nice quality, but the color is WAY off - nothing like the picture. I was looking for a wine color, but this is more of a pink/bright red/orange color. Not going to work - it might be OK for a little girl's room, but terrible for a living room!!

I hate that they are pictured as a somewhat sheer. They are completely transparent! So, when the sun is up, you can't tell what color they are. The tops are pictured as white, then fade into grey. Mine were barely ombre. Just a light grey, into a dark grey, but most of it was dark grey.

The material was not as sheer as it appears and the color at the top was closer to a washed out pink. Disappointing. We returned.

Way too see through for me!

These are way too sheer! They don‚Äôt look as I expected. I questioned if adding another pair will help ‚Äúthicken‚Äù up the look but I don‚Äôt think so. Unsure if I will keep them up.

I purchased the beige, it had a purple tint. At first, I thought I received the wrong color but they don't offer it on purple. beware if you buy the beige

Not at all like the color scheme in the image online.  I ordered white to grey ombr√© .. these are a gross brown color. Returning them.

They are very cheap looking & feel like material from a cheap tutu.

Faded from UV rays within a month in the summer in North East PA. Turned orange.

Curtains appeared heavier in product photo.

To thin

Disappointed.The fabric is extremely sheer

I didn‚Äôt like anything about it

Good quality, easy to hang, and looks fantastic in the room. The length was exactly what I was looking for.

Excellent quality, easy to hang, looks great in my bedroom.

The curtains are great! Exactly what I wanted.

They are very nice Just too sheer for what I was looking for.

Beautiful

I love them

There beautiful quality is great but the color was not as pictured they are grey thru and thru was thinking the top was white but I'll keep them anyway

Would recommend. Beautiful. Sheer. Ombre

The curtains are beautiful; however, they only appear to be all gray. I purchased these curtains for the beautiful noticeable shades of colors. I will keep them for now because my husband already had them up when I came home.

They were perfect for my living room!

Curtains are extremely sheer. This will not help with energy efficiency during the winter. I now have to find something to go under them so people can‚Äôt see inside my house. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed honestly, I thought they‚Äôd be thicker.

The color is very different and dull/sad looking (not at all what is in the picture). I chose these specifically for the color and it‚Äôs not pretty or happy at all.

I purchased 2 of these. Both were the grey one. One looked a little more brown. I checked my purchase and the packaging both said grey but they were certainty not the same.

I was really dissapointed that I can't see the ombre effect.  Overly priced

Very sheer, good value for the money

It was very see it all most nothing haggling

They was to long.

Very chip, they are beautiful but look very chip. And they are. Value for money, fast delivery.

The stitching on this curtain is shocking.not impressed at all.Like the style of them just poor finish

Am disappointed with these purely because the stitching is white and looks really odd,especially at the bottom of the curtains where it is really noticeable. You would think that for a grey sheer curtain they would be stitched with grey thread!

overall they are nice curtains but the darker brown not quite as brown as it looks in the picture.  Still they are nice and I will keep them

Not a huge fan, the dimensions said they SHOULD have matched up perfectly with my other curtains but they were shorter than the description stated. Also they look a bit cheap.. would be ok for a girls/teenager room, or guest room, but not quality enough for a primary bedroom or room a lot of people see.

2 pairs ordered. 1 pair was as advertised. The other had the same product #, but was a different color and a different fabric.Not pleased.

Cute. But not burgundy. Its all pink

Good for the price but more sheer than advertised and the grey is not as apparent as in the picture.

The design is nice.  My only complaint is that the fabric is extremely sheer.

I purchased the olive color and am disappointed to see the color is much lighter than in the picture. When I opened the package even the folded up several-layers rectangle of curtain with no light coming through, looked almost white at the top. The bottom color also isn‚Äôt the deep olive it is in pictures. Still quite pretty and serve their purpose, and some might be pleased that they are lighter colors, but for me it knocked off sone stars.

Too see through for my liking. Incredibly thin

Had to return, only one in the pkg. Appearance was ok, but fabric was rough.

I love how these curtains look, unfortunately I've had them for less than 2 weeks and have noticed they are already tearing at the hoops in a few places.

The picture definitely doesn't do them Justice they are completely sheer you see right through them Don't get me wrong they're beautiful but I was looking for more of a slightly sheer where I can still keep out the sun but I was not living in a cave

I purchased 4 packs, 2 have a brownish color to them, some are whiter than others, but they are a good length.

Description says faux linen‚Äîthey don‚Äôt resemble linen at all!  They look like a regular sheer.

They are very see through, more for looks than privacy. You can see right into room with curtain drawn. Room gets very warm because there is not coverage or shade when fully shut

Bedroom curtains.  Too sheer. Like the Ambra look

Way more sheer than the photo showed and i was expecting.

The curtains are ok but not what I was looking for my bedroom. They were too long but could be my measurements but definitely too sheer for me.

They allow light in and the yellow really brightens it up the room. I did notice some snags in the fabric but they aren't really noticeable.

Nice but very sheer & not very dark on the bottom. These were okay.... not the BEST. They will do for now.

Just opened yesterday and noticed that its damaged, will be returning.

The stitching is done with white thread and it‚Äôs sloppy so doesn‚Äôt look nice.

The color is an ombre blueish to purple. Nowhere near denim

It didn't have the colors in the picture a little

Color was not as presented

I didn‚Äôt notice the silver grommet rings with the brown curtains; but I returned it because I felt bronze grommet rings would have been a better match.  Also, the stitching for the hem around the brown curtain should have brown thread instead of white.  The ombr√© was fine, but the curtain is very sheer with this faux linen.

We have had these curtains now for approximately a year. I had bought a second one that we forgot to hang right away. Went to hang them this past week and noticed that the ones that had been hanging for the year were no longer gray but all of the area that was exposed to the sun changed to purple. The section of the curtain that was not in the sun was still gray. Outside of the colour change they are nice sheer curtains.

Nice curtains, like the ombr√© look, they are very sheer, but perfect in lounge for summer time. Don‚Äôt think they are worth the price though, but was only ones I could find near the colour I wanted

Perfect for bedroom. Love the color fade.

These were very pretty. I know they were advertised as sheer, but they were a bit too sheer for my needs, so I purchase 2 and doubled them up.

I bought these while thinking Ombre curtains in my new living room would be something different to try. I wanted a light brown for brightness and the dark brown to go with my furniture. Let me tell you. As soon as I took them out of the package I was not seeing brown at all. I asked three different people what their intake was on the color while thinking maybe it was just me. Nope! It wasn't. They didn't go with my light subtle yellow painted walls at all nor my brown furniture. I tried to like them but just couldn't. I was so disappointed. I didn't care much for the rough texture either. They didn't seem to fall nicely up to the window. Kind of stiff. Of course these are all my personal opinions on the product, not that there was anything wrong with them. I simply didn't see the brown. Light and/or dark, it's just not there to me. In stead of wasting more money on another pair trying the "dark brown Ombre" possibly matching or not. Being the simpleton that I am. I'd best stick with solids. lol

They are very nice but as it doesn't say in the description, these are sheer.

If you are looking for a soft, light look, then these are for you. They are completely SHEER with a touch of sheen.  For me, they were exactly what I was looking for. They blended with my walls and bedspread and gave just the right softness to the window.

I decided to purchase this curtain to replace my prior curtains. It‚Äôs a lot more sheer than the product images which is ok with me. Had to do a first-pass steam because it was too crinkled. But happy with my purchase. Wanted curtains that offered contrast to the wall/sliding door and not be blackout curtains. This fits the bill.

The curtains themselves are great quality and super cute. But the grommets are made of a very cheap plastic. I couldn‚Äôt really tell when I hung them though because I used them as the centers between other curtains and they are only for looks. If you‚Äôre going to be using these and opening/closing them frequently though I‚Äôm not sure how great they would be at sliding or how long they would hold up. For the price though they are great, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still giving them a 4/5.

Its for living rm, like yhe coloring, just not as full as I had hoped. So nought another set, not value for the $$

I use this curtain on my living room my home looks attractive n fall of brightness. Love the material n color.easy for matching too.

If you want sheer- these are it. They are extremely sheer and do not look like the photo.

Ready for a flood *insert 1,000 crying emojis*

If you want sheer, then this is for you.  I really didn't care if was sheer or not, because I just planned to use the panels to warm up the window a little.  It works really well as side panels only, wouldn't use if I wanted to darken my room, as it does not do that.  Nice ombre look for my guest bedroom.

Bought 3 panels and they are still very sheer. Very very pretty but will not block light or provide privacy.

Was expecting curtains to be thicker, seem a little pricey for the curtains now that I've received them-do like the colors.

Ok for the price i guess. You certainly can not change your clothes with these curtains up in your bedroom. Better to have a shade behind them for sure. These are super thin. Material is really rough, loose weave.

The curtains are beautiful.  The sheerness is nice and light weight materials blow in the breeze nicely.  I had order this style from another company and was sent the wrong color 2 times.  This is a nice grey ombre style.  I would purchase them again.

Loved it but no pictures please.  Thanks.

These are very sheer. Beautiful color light on top dark on the bottom. Nice large grommets for hanging

I decided to drape them from the top of the wall And they look beautiful.

These are simple sheers that look like the photo. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the grommets are cheap plastic. I was hoping they'd be metal but at least you can't tell when they're hanging. They are great for the price.

on the picture, it looks like you would not be able to see through the curtain but unfortunately, you can and can I just say that I am so happy at the fact that it is like that because it just looks ten times better than the picture-Sheer material

Very well made curtains. They are sheer, and very pretty. The ombre goes from dark gray to light gray. I had to return because they didnt match like I hoped, but very nice product.

I love them

I actually really like these but they‚Äôre very sheer. I‚Äôm using them for a bedroom and they look nice but are def not even slightly helpful with blocking out light or anything like that. They‚Äôre more for the ombr√© look.

I haven't got around to putting them up yet but I'm sure it'll look beautiful. I just love the color

They are okay, but I am disappointed with how sheer they are. The ombr√© is very subtle, not as noticeable as in the pictures.

Very light ombre and definitely sheer. I double them up and put small twinkle lights in between. As advertised

These are very sheer so I purchased an energy efficient curtain to back it! The sheer curtain is very pretty though!

They are super see through which is kind of deceiving in the pics. Other than that, they are true to the description.

The bottom hems are not even, but for value I can deal with it.

Beautiful, better than the picture.

Just like any other sheer curtain.

Really nice and pretty

I love these curtains but they‚Äôre not really good for keeping the sun and heat out. Just a lil sad because our puppy ate them.

These are nice for the money but I did not like the fact that they are from China and it said that no where in the product description or on the packaging (of the first 4 set that I received) after ordering 3 more sets, those packages were labeled MADE IN CHINA

I like the color, fabric and quality and transparency and light.

They are light and perfect!  The grommet style makes it easy to open daily. They do a fair job of blocking the sun more importantly I wanted something stylish and different for my large window. I love my purchase.

Love these curtains

I am in love with these shears love the ombre. I have ordered 2 sets one is brown and the other set is black just beautiful. I found curtains to also match these.

Love them..

Sheer with privacy

As advertised. Nice quality

Just as described. The style is nice. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Quality is good. I haven‚Äôt seen extra strings or anything. Doesn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúrun‚Äù or ‚Äúcatch‚Äù Easy either. I‚Äôd recommend.

They are very nice well made I love them I love the colors

I hung these in my bathroom. They look amazing with my decor!

I‚Äôm in love with what I purchased than you so much

Perfect length and color!

Very pleased. They are a little more sheer than they appear in the primary picture. Which was great for us, since that is what we wanted.

I purchased these for living and dining room. The are absolutely beautiful. Prefect sheer curtain to let light in. Will purchase more on different color.

Perfect color match for my walls in guest bedroom. Love them!

This is my second purchase from this company. I am so happy with these sheers. I bought 3 sets of these sheers, 2 were 84‚Äù long and 1 was 63‚Äù long. They are a great fit and look beautiful over the windows. They elevate the room to a new level of elegance. Definitely recommend.

Exactly what I expected

Thin , see thru ,  wish it was a little darker but I like the ombr√© color

Very pretty and well made.

I think I made a good financial and decorate choice

Sheer Panels. 1-1/2 rings

These are exactly what we needed to finish the guest room!  Nice sheer material to cut the light a little but still give a beautiful finish to the room.

Perfect for my teenage son. Very happy with my purchase.

Its not ombre like you would except, unless mine is the wrong item. I have a sheer gray color from top to bottom .. no ombre effect.

The width and length was on point and the colors blended with my other decorations.

The curtains are so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è there exactly what I needed.

Bought these for my seashore-motif bedroom, and they look great, with light blue sheers between them.

Daughters bedroom

Nice choice

I love the curtains the beautiful colors and the quality

We love these curtains! The subtle gradient is so pretty. FYI they're VERY sheer, which is ok for day time for us but I had to buy more to fill it more in for night time because I wanted to have the same fabric look. We love them, really nice quality. I only wish they were slightly less sheer but they're still wonderful!

Love them

They look good and color match well.  Wife Happy, so I'm Happy.

Fit my bedroom windows perfectly. Its hard to see but ombre color really makes them pop.They are sheer yet offer enough privacy. I live in FL so I have my windows open a lot & they worked perfectly

These are beautiful. Been looking for fade curtains that go from tan/beige to brown (rather than white to brown). I have layered them on top of our dark brown blackout curtains and gives it a awesome look! Love em!

I loved them Until I wash them for first time on delicate and they started coming apart the rings don't hold to materials supposed to be machine washable

Beautiful. Sheek. Let's in lots of light. Change my entire living room. Feels fresh.

My daugther loves these curtains they mate her furniture well

I loved them so much I bought my cousin a set.

I ordered the Black Ombre. They're a beautiful, substantive material. It adds the visual interest I wanted without being too busy to go with various bedding I use - printed or solid as my mood changes! My room is a light gray and purple with black furniture. They're just perfect. I smile when I go into my room! They aren't completely blackout but I have blinds behind them so it's perfect. They do darken the room nicely with the blinds up.

I have these styles/colors of these curtains throughout my home. They are excellent addition to the blinds already in place. ‚ù§Ô∏è

These were advertised as black out curtains. They do not block any daylight. The print on them is cute, but they do not function as black out curtains. Do not buy them for that purpose.

Not blackout curtains at all.

The fabric is nice but they are definitely not blackout curtains. I will be returning them.

I just did not like these.  They look much better in the picture than they do hanging up.  I returned these

Instead of a ombr√© look, the curtains looked faded

They would have been lovely drapes if that was what I was looking for. I needed blackout curtains and wanted something with a pattern. I ended up returning these and getting black velvety ACTUAL blackout curtains.,

The pattern is beautiful but these are most definitely NOT blackout curtains - you can absolutely see the window shining through behind them. Very dissapointed.

These curtains are advertised to be 52 inches wide and blackout. While they are fairly heavy and apparently have some sort of light blocking material on the inside, they are nowhere near blackout and at least 8" off on their measurement. I have a 94" window so 2 of them should completely cover. However, even completely stretched, they only measure 48". Not sure if I got a bad one or not. Also, where they were folded in the package, the light blocking material seems to have broken and it looks as if there is a tear down the middle. Also, in the picture, the bottom appears to be dark gray, almost black - however the color is much lighter. Waste of money and will have to buy a different set.

These are 100% different than the description. They are supposed to be, ‚Äútop performance black out curtains,‚Äù blocking most light.. these don‚Äôt block hardly ANY light. This is such a joke honestly, the only thing I like about it is the color, but even that isn‚Äôt as shown in pics. They advertised these to be true black out curtains and they are more sheer than most regular curtains! üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This was a total waste of money and time, I do not recommend the purchase if you are really looking for black out curtains. (Also, I‚Äôm my reference picture, it was taken early morning on a cloudy day üòÇüëè so you can only imagine what a sunny mid day will look like)

The uploaded picture is when it is raining outside during the day. Light is entirely leaking out through the curtain. This product is flat out lying about being blackout.

We bought these curtains because we were specifically looking for blackout curtains with a nice design. We were happy with this design, so we purchased them. Upon putting them up, we learned that these are definitely not blackout curtains. You can see the light coming thru them plenty. See our picture attached. The curtains don‚Äôt cover the entire window so there is light coming around the edges, which is fine, that is not the curtains fault, but this light that is coming thru the center is our issue. It should be blocked completely. This felt like false advertising since they are not blackout and we are not happy with this purchase.

I‚Äôm so disappointed in these curtains. Material is flawed everywhere. You don‚Äôt notice the sun hours them, so check carefully!

They are not blackout curtains

Bought these "blackout" curtains first because they were supposed to be blackout and second because of the design. We wanted blackout curtains that weren't just a sold color. The problem, they don't block out any more light than regular curtains. Definitely not "blackout" as listed. I even took the attached picture on a rainy cloudy morning facing west and they still let in almost as much light as when the windows were open.They block out more light than sheer curtains,  but no more than standard non-blackout curtains. Not satisfied with this purchase.

Save your money go to Target and buy a black out curtain. I‚Äôve had many black out curtains and this is definitely not one. I am very disappointed. I thought the light would actually be blocked. Please see photo. Maybe the blackout part of my curtain is missing? Seller please let me know and I can fix the review if it is a defective curtain.

I bought the grey ones in August 2022. It's only been a year and it's not very blackout I can still see quite a bit of light through the curtains AND they are now sun faded on the edges. They turned a redish-brown color. I attached the color that they turned. Mind you, they were grey.

Not sure how these are labeled blackout curtains, they are not even close to true blackout curtains like Eclipse brand.Update 8/7/24 - We ended up keeping these and using Eclipse brand liners to help (but they don't fit perfectly. Still leaving the 1 star, they should be ashamed calling these blackout curtains, especially at this price point.

They don't black out the street lights and appear to be thin and light for something that is advertised as thermal insulated.  Curtains I have purchased locally are way better.  I'll be returning these.

THE CURTAINS FADE! Seriously faded. Now it looks like garbage. Who wants faded curtains - no one. You may want to pass on these because the curtains start to fade after a while and you have really ugly fade marks on them. I have purchased other curtains from other manufacturers and this has not happened.

Package included only 1 curtain instead of 2.

These curtains were advertised as blackout curtains and also came up as thermal insulated. Neither of which are true. I could have bought the same thing at a big box store cheaper and quicker.

I ordered 3 sets of taupe color, as listed in the second picture.  What arrived was grey, as listed in the first picture. Quality is good but color is very important. Very disappointing!

Do not let this ad or the reviews for you. These are definitely not black out curtains! The ombre coloring is not that noticeable once they‚Äôre up on the window. They just appear to be the same color throughout.When we hung them the just touched to top of the floor and after two days it is bunched at the bottom from the fabric stretching out

Like others have apparently said. Pretty but not blackout.

As you can see by the video these are NOT BLACKOUT CURTAINS! If I wanted regular curtains I would not have purchased what was ADVERTISED AS BLACKOUT. I NEEDED BLACKOUT.Yet ANOTHER waste of money.

The description says the curtains are supposed to be blackout and thermal insulated. That's a lie. They are one thin sheet of cloth that's practically see thru. Very disappointed. A total waste of money. Will never buy from this dealer again.

Only difference is the size I ordered. If they all would have been either light or dark it would have been fine.  I ordered 3 long and 1 short. All the long are the same color.  The short curtain is closest to matching the original that I wanted

Described style and color and texture not as expected

The binds were closed and it was still lot of light coming from the curtain :(Don't waste your money if you want a dark room.Good color though

They're decent curtains. They're just not "Blackout" as described. The spring sun is shing bright and right through, does not even minimize the sun or brightness. I purchased they grey color.

We bought these for the title "black out" curtains. Unfortunately they are not dark enough for our day sleeper. You can definitely see clearly in the bedroom during the day. The room looks more like dusk until night time.If we had known we probably would not have bought them for our bedroom. Other then that, they are wrinkle free and a great value.

Extremely disappointed. I'm sure they do the job everyone says. BUT I purchased 6 sets total, 84" length and the shorter size. The photos show they transition from a dark Grey to lighter grayish white. Sending them back because they are solid Grey with a pattern, close to the bottom to mid color very disappointed.

These look more like western handkerchiefs than the shiny ombr√© with SUBTLE print pictured. However looking at some other reviews I now wonder if this is a different product than others received. Anyway, mine are going back.

Definitely not sunlight blocking in any way. You can actually see right threw them. They are pretty but you will have to buy a sun blocking liner to put behind them.

Not close to what I ordered .. They were supposed to be thick, energy saving, blackout curtains.  They're so sheer you can see through them and they're twice as long as they should be.  I paid over 40.00 for curtains I can't even use!!!

Poor quality. Sheer not blackout. No color transition from beige to brown as shown in photos

The last picture is what they are suppose to look like. The two I took is how they really look‚Ä¶.horrible. They are NOT yellow at all! I put them up before I ironed them just to see the color better!!!! Hate when you get things that are not true to color!!!!! Ugggggg!!!!

Love the pattern but they are not blackout curtains by any means. Cheap material

They are not what was advertised.  They said blackout curtains.  They are not. I work nights and need these to help me sleep during the day and block the sunlight plus the heat in my room. The fabric is nice but not at all blackout curtains.

I do not like these curtains because the picture show light top and gets darker to the bottom.  It also shows a beautiful pattern on the curtains and you can not see it on the curtains.  It  is all the same color.

Please don't buy. Walmart products are better than this garbage.  Yet another cheap product brought to is by Amazon. I hope Amazon looks into this product and removes it from site. Yes, that is a thing

Curtains are good quality, but if you are looking for a bright sunshine yellow, these aren‚Äôt for you.They are mustard yellow at best and look like they have been hanging in a smokers house under bright lights for 40 years.Color is muted and depressing.

This is NOT blackout. Extremely sheer and lightweight. You could tell as soon as it came out of the packaging. Do NOT waste your money. My daughter is having such a terrible time sleeping because we have bright street lights outside her room.

Even with my blinds closed you can see how bright it is, and they are very light like summer curtains so they won't keep the cold down.Waste of my money.

As you can see these are NOT Blackout or Thermal curtains/drapes. They also do not have a gradient color change. Material is soft but thin.Rip off! Waste of time

These curtains are thin and had several stitching defects. The majority of the light would leak through and did not function as advertised.

The product does not resemble the pic.  You need to super enlarge the pic to see the pattern, which I do not like.

The product photo makes it look like these are a grey shade of white on top. What i got was almost a solid grey, very misleading

Nothing right about this order wrong size and wrong color?should have been anbray

The Curtains do not look like the ones in the picture on Amazon they are not blackout curtains the sun comes through them

These are my second pair I bought because I like them so much. They are high quality, heavy weight drapes. The color is true to the picture. I did not expect these to be as good a quality as they are. They truly are light blocking, drape well, and even have some sound deadening qualities because of their weight. They do come in with folded creases but that's to be expected. I just threw them in the dryer for 15 minutes and they creases were gone and ready for hanging. Love these!

Its made of a great, thick material, it Completely blocks out the sun and the color/pattern is just gorgeous.

I bought these because my new bedroom the light from a nearby streetlight and my neighbors back yard light are enough to be annoying.  These are light blocking but not 100% though I think all those ads that have pictures like to pretend the light doesn't leak at the top and bottom.  I have paired these with new rods that let the curtains curve around to the side. I've also bought blackout cellular shades that I'm hoping to inside mount. So I think that will end up working well. That being said they are nice heavy drapes and the pattern and color looks really nice so I'm pretty happy.  They didn't claim 100% blackout just "most" of the UV light.  They did great blocking the outdoor light. If you need these for daytime sleep I'd look elsewhere for better blocking or pair them like I intend to with a blackout window shade. I had a hard time finding curtains in a color I wanted because most of them are very long but I have an air vent under the one window so needed a specific length.

So I'm going to go ahead and preface my review by saying that I moved into a two-story townhome with large picture windows and a heck of a lot of daylight burning bright and everywhere it can to get in to my home. So I can't be an excellent judge of character on these curtains being the best in the way of "blackout" as their advertised and labeled and you can make evidence of by other photos and video from other customers.That said, they do an amazing job at what they do. They keep a substantial amount of light and heat at bay and I've already noticed a slight reduction in my electric bill thanks to putting these up.If you think I'm exaggerating on the electric bill, I'm not. My main living room is an open floor plan that includes a large double sliding glass door on either side of the room and on the living room side above. It is a equally large picture window as well as a full length window around the corner from the other sliding glass door. So while I fell in love with the space and the look, I did not fall in love with the fact that the son literally rises into my eyes and sets into my bedroom every evening. Did I mention I also have a third double sliding glass door in my bedroom upstairs? Yes, it's a little excessive at this point.Hence the need for these curtains. So far they've impressed me on their quality. From the second I opened the package based off of the price. I didn't know what to expect and I guess I just got lucky in that category with a great deal because these are premium quality fabric that are nicely tailored and have a semi-modern design blended into an ombre fade. I will say based off the seller photos I am very glad that I got the BLACK CURTAINS.Black is my favorite color and I have no problem with black curtains. However, considering the amount of windows I'm looking to cover, I didn't want it to be overpowering and these do a nice job of being dark while understated. The light can hit them just right that it's very illusory.I've included several photos which were very hard to take in the lighting that I have to work with even with the curtains fully drawn. But I hope you get the gist and I have no complaints about this purchase except I do wish I would have gotten a longer cut but that's just for my personal taste.Overall, this is an item I am happy to recommend to anyone looking to add a little style and shade to your favorite space.

Love these. Look great. I did buy two sets (4 panels) per window. Wanted that ‚Äúfuller‚Äù look. Good price. Good quality.

Drapes are heavyweight with rich turquoise ombre as described.  Damask pattern is printed on the fabric, not woven. Two 54-inch wide drapes per package; hanging by the built-in metal rings these drapes cover about 98 inch total width. They look perfect on a 60-inch wide window.

I‚Äôve had these curtains for a little over a year. Love the pattern. Love the thermal quality. Looking at them now as I‚Äôm taking them down to wash, I see the sun has faded the material purple in some areas that faced outside. So, if you are going to use these for an extended time in a window that gets a lot of sun, keep that in mind.

Does not block out light great if you want dark but they look nice and seem well made

No they are not blackout like everyone is complaining. But they do drop the light in the room an enormous percentage. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day outside when I hung them. But in the video you can see how bright it is in my apartment with the windows bare and with the drapes pulled ‚Äì no blinds. Major diff.One thing that I was a bit upset about when I took it out of the package, The entire bag was completely soaked. Not the shipping bag but the inside clear bag. Like the curtains were completely wet and left out in the rain and then packed up. Not one dry spot.You can see some of the rust from the zipper that stained the curtains. I don't know who was at fault for that, But it was a bit upsetting hence the four stars. Otherwise the color of the blinds and everything else were amazing. Beautiful and I look forward to having a cooler summer in my old elementary school apartments!

The curtains are beautiful, but not blackout as the description. They only darken the room, which is fine by us. Good value for the size we ordered. We had to return the first set because it had rust stains from the grommets. The replacement set was fine though.

These curtains do not lay flat‚Ä¶maybe user error or just the way they are made, but how the curl into the middle puts the inside gray material exposed to the sun for 50% of the day and you can see clear discoloration because of this. Not sure if it is the material it is made of that causes a reaction from sunlight or what. Just thought others should know before they buy to plan these curtains on windows with no direct sunlight.

PREMIUM WORKMANSHIP-Our medallion patterned blackout curtains with premium workmanship are color resistant and tear resistant, feature quality stitch work, inspected to ensure no loose threads, all seams and hem aligned.  That‚Äôs what it says however after ironing and hanging it is apparent the panels are uneven and have threads showing. I love the colors and ordered a second set hoping they will look better. I do not feel they are worth the $43. But since they are a perfect color palette and match all the pictures in the room I am keeping them and rehemming them myself.

I‚Äôve had several blackout curtains over the years and these do not block out nearly as much light as any of the others I‚Äôve had. They look descent and block some light but I wouldn‚Äôt call them a true blackout curtain.

Color wasn‚Äôt as good as picture shows

Product good Package left at front door not back door

The color and print are wonderful, just what I wanted. The design is perfect and matches the picture.  I love the Ombre effect's very nice change to just the color all through.These are sheer and not blackout the sun comes right through. Something must be wrong with these.  Everyone else seems to say these are heavy and keep the sun out.  I paid more than I would have liked but for the blackout effect was ok.

The curtain is not ombr√© as stated it is same color. Decent quality for the money but don‚Äôt really care for the print

They‚Äôre nice and thick but you can definitely see through them. They let in a lot of sunlight.

Beautiful curtains, keeps out heat so far but definitely not blackout.

Nice curtains but not really blackout curtains. They block most sunlight but not all.

Look closely as the curtains purchased are transitional from a light color to a darker color on the bottom.  It was my mistake for not catching this.The curtain blackout was not to the darkening of the room that I was hoping to achieve.

First I would like to add that I had a very hard time finding the right size curtains for my double window.  After trying multiple sizes and kinds of curtains I chose these since they fit perfectly and looked great with the rest of the room.  One thing to note is that even though these are advertised as blackout curtains I would categorize these as room darkening curtains at best.  After doing some research I found that this company sells 100% blackout curtains as well, but not in this style.  I am hoping this helps someone in the future as I feel that advertising these as blackout is deceiving to the customer.

Loved these curtains at first until I realized that they wrinkle very easily,  when I open curtains and tie back they are very wrinkled then opened back up

We liked the look of these curtains and after running them in the dryer for a few minutes most of the wrinkles from the packaging came out.  However, we bought these to be black out curtains and as you can see from the picture, they are most assuredly not black out.

Black out is an overstatement. They darken the room a decent amount, but thats not what I purchased them for.

If they did what they advertised as blackout curtains (would have been happy with at least 85% but more like 60-70% darkening) the material is lighter and softer which can be nice since it's not still... however it's hardly made for "keeping heat/cold out" to help keep inside from feeling extra heat or chilly drafts near window so I don't see it being helpful for conserving energy sadly. Sure the teal color and print is nice but there were a lot of other contenders with higher ratings and more cost effective prices. But I fell in love with the color scheme and wanted to make it work even if it didn't serve it's purpose entirely because it was going to look amazing.Sadly, I was disappointed on every level and it's not often I take a chance like this üòÆ‚Äçüí®

I have had these curtains for two years.  In the beginning they are beautiful, but sunlight changes the color.  Out of the 7 different curtain sets that I have purchased from Amazon, these are the only ones that don't live up to expectations.  I didn't notice the changes until I took them down to wash them.  I would not recommend purchasing this set of curtains.

The gradient is beautiful and the feel is very nice.  They hang well as they have a soft fabric.  That being said they won't block out light - look for "true blackout" or "100% blackout" when searching Amazon.

The dimensions should have worked as they are supposed to be the same as every other curtain I've used on these windows but they were really short and no matter what I tried, the length was not there. It's funny because I bought the same size in another design from someone else and they worked perfect. So make sure to size up for the extra fabric. Also the color seemed off.

Curtains look good but were suppose to be blackout curtains.  They may be just a little but for a dark room they don't work to well. I kept the curtains as they do look good with the bedspread I got to go with them just wish the blackout feature was better.

The curtain look very nice but are not completely ‚Äúblack out‚Äù as advertised.  Still keeps the room fairly dark.

I was hoping this was a true blackout curtains especially because of how cute the design was, but there is a good amount of light that comes in. I'm past my return window otherwise i would have returned. I'm currently finding different curtains.

These are nice curtains, but they let a lot of light through. If they were lined and truly blackout curtains they would be perfect.

It blocks out most light, however it is not completely blackout. The print design is true to form with the exception of the ombr√© effect. This photo in the light I took looks a little better than it should, but the gradient is very very subtle and pretty dark. I was hoping it was a more pronounced light to dark like the image.Frankly I‚Äôm not mad to the point of returning them, but in case someone else was hoping for a cool gradient moment like I was, this is is more in line with what to expect.

I got these curtains (4 panels) a year ago almost to date. I got stains on two of the panels so got new ones to replace. It wasn‚Äôt until I was putting the new ones up I realized how much they had faded. It looks like the old ones are now the gray ombr√©. The only saving grace is it being ombr√© so it kinda goes together. These are also ‚Äúgrey‚Äù out curtains. It‚Äôs 6:30 pm, cloudy, and there‚Äôs still light coming through. They‚Äôre nice looking and have a soft touch, just not the best quality.

i ordered this product..when i received,found a blood like stain‚Ä¶.

As you can see in the picture above‚Ä¶there is this odd line RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE!!!It does block out a lot of Sun‚Ä¶and I live in Az sooo we have Sun.. Other than that odd line it is amazing!!!! And good quality

I wanted blackout curtains but these aren‚Äôt, they are pretty for curtains but blackout; errrrmmm no. Pls don‚Äôt get them if u need black out curtains especially in the summer.

The print and quality of the curtains are perfect, the only thing I have a complaint about is that they are not as Ombr√© as they are in the stock photo.  They don‚Äôt look horrible, just not the look I was going for..I specifically picked these because I thought they weren‚Äôt too dark and would work well with the style I am going with.  In the stock photo the tops are almost white, on the ones I received they are a dark grey‚Ä¶

The curtains are a good quality, block out most light but the coloring is not as it shows in the pictures.  The gradient is very subtle.  It looks more like it's two tone instead of gradient.  Sending them back because I have to hem them which takes off even more of the darker color.  Very disappointed.

The pattern was not as vibrant and the length seemed longer than advertised

I‚Äôve ordered these curtains two times‚Ä¶ this is what I got for the black option..I was hoping they‚Äôd match üò©I just ordered a third set so hopefully I get the right ombr√©

Light penetrates the curtains and flows into the room, the image is on a cloudy day, looks great but just not black out

If you need black out curtains DO NOT buy . These curtains are so sheer I can see my hand through the material.  These curtains block less light than the curtains in use now.The color is pretty and the print is nice. Over blinds these will be fine.The seller is NOT being honest. These are not black out curtains

Color selected is brown.  Is grey at best.Construction is good fabric is good but the color is way off

The color matched in person but I didn‚Äôt like the print as much when I saw it. The curtain is heavy and the intended room didn‚Äôt really need blackout.

the curtains had strained/snagged fabric in a couple of places straight out of the box.the ombre effect isn't as pronounced in person as it is on the website description.

First, I liked the material and the fact that the curtains really do keep the hot afternoon sun out.  What I don't like is the curtains don't look anything like the advertised photo.  They don't have the nice gradient in the nice shade of blue shown on Amazon nor is the pattern minimized as they are in the same photo.  The pattern stands out too much.  I am very disappointed.

These blinds are beautiful. Not a bad stitch in site. The fabric is soft and without defects. But they are not 'blackout' in any sense of the word.For those that work odd hours and need to sleep during the day, like my wife, these curtains will not block out enough light to assist with daytime sleeping. If you are a daytime sleeper, look elsewhere.If you just want to block out some morning or evening light, cool the room a bit, and love the look, then you will love these blinds.

Color isn't vibrant like in the picture.  Very dull and drab

Love the pattern but very disappointed they were not fully blackout.  I purchased these to replace my full blackout curtains to freshen up the room.  Will be returning these.

I purchased these curtains for blackout. They were the perfect color and pretty pattern imo. But they were meant for blocking the sun and once up on the window you could see all the lines from the blinds. Sun shines through.

They‚Äôre in my living room.  One of the packages looked like they were a return.  They were not folded, just stuffed into bag!I had to iron them before I could put them up!!  I feel like they were over-priced!

The curtains are soft, but I have returned them as they're not really Ombre.  They are lighter on top, then a a dark portion on the bottom, no gradient in color.  There is also a horizontal seam through the middle of the curtains.

While these curtains will darken the room, light can be seen through the curtains. True black out won‚Äôt let any light through.

While pretty,  they are not blackout curtains as described. I bought these specifically to reduce heat in our west facing room. They are semi-sheer and are no better than what I had before. Returning.

The curtains themselves are very pretty, and they are made out of a quality fabric, but our window faces east, and these were not up to the task of blocking the morning sun.

I would of liked the difference in the color from top to bottom to be as different and vivid as the picture.  But it is not.  But the curtains are soft and well made.

Curtains work fine, blocks the cold air - the color is the same from top to bottom, I expected them to look like the picture.

The length is perfect for our big window. They keep out the heat and cold. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is the color. In the picture it looks like there will be a more dramatic color change but in real life it goes from light green to a slightly darker green. Hardly any white at the top. But they do look great in the room.

The color is not as pictured it does have some of the color but it is dull and more of a pinkish beige color blending down into a color I wouldn‚Äôt describe as the color in the picture.  Curtains are fairly heavier than I expected.

I wanted to love these but they are too long. Labeled as same length as ones pictured on right.

They're really pretty and they go so well with my newly painted walls and  I love how they look.... but I should have read further on the light blocking abilities.... I work night shift and sleep during the day and they do a pretty crappy job at actually blocking the light.  They are decently heavy so I'm hoping they help with insulation better than they block the light...

The 84‚Äù gradient black curtains don‚Äôt look like the picture. There is practically no gradient effect. They are only slightly lighter at the top. Dark gray turned to darker gray. When hanging, they look completely monochromatic. This is my only complaint and the reason why I returned them.Note that I also bought the 96‚Äù version, and the gradient effect on the 96‚Äù ones was more prominent, but still not as dramatic as they look in the picture.  I also got the light gray version of these curtains, and they looked exactly like the light gray picture. Please view the photo I uploaded to see the gradient effect (the lack of). The colors in my photo are warmer than in reality, but you can get an idea.The fabric is very nice, smooth, has sheen, and it got rid of the wrinkles on its own overnight. If not for the color I would be very happy with them.

I love the color and the pattern,  they are nice curtains at a good price.  I have 4 stars because they aren't as dark as some of the blackout curtains I've had,  it isn't a huge issue but it may be for someone else.  They are also a bit too long but that's my fault for not measuring correctly

These are very nice curtains. I couldn‚Äôt give 5 stars due to a few pulls in the fabric causing small dotted lines about 4-5‚Äù long. It‚Äôs not noticeable at all far away but up close you can see them. They are very soft, silky feeling and block most light out. I bought them for more privacy and they‚Äôre very opaque but still let in some light. The reason why I got them was because I liked the blue ombr√© like in the picture and they were a good price. What I got was like a greenish blue color. These actually look better in my living room so I decided to keep them. They were very creased when I got them but I used my steamer on them and they look great. I had to take up the hem because they were too long and they went through my sewing machine very well. I also used my iron on the bottom on the poly setting and the material irons well too, although I‚Äôd recommend a steamer if you have one. Overall, I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them.

These curtains did a great job at helping block out light and helping to keep the temperature lower inside during the summer. I haven‚Äôt had these during winter yet, so I‚Äôm not sure about how they will do with keeping the heat inside. The color is nice and the texture is soft and silky. They only had one horizontal wrinkle from how they were packaged. They are fairly heavy and thick so they don‚Äôt wrinkle easy. I took a video to show how sheer they are. You can see my hand behind the curtain only when I‚Äôm touching the back side of it, but if I‚Äôm not, you can barely see my hand. Overall a good purchase.

52√ó84, Color: BlackAfter a few months we finally got around to opening these curtains. Great quality, good price and nice design. Decent for filtering out the light.I used 4 panels on one patio door which helped to darken the room. On the window I used 2 panels and the darkening was not as good. [See photo]Note: there are also blinds behind the curtains to assist with darkening.One major thing is they didn't appear to look ombre with the gradual fade from very light to dark in the online photo.[See photo]. I checked the order, and these were the ones I ordered.I really didn't care. Love them and the color [Black], although preferred the light to dark ombre look.

We bought these curtains to go over top of our existing blinds that were not great at keeping the morning light out. The combination of blinds AND these curtains do work amazing at night, it's pitch black we don't see the moonlight nor street lamps!! In the morning however, not the same story. The curtains brighten up a bit with the morning light and it's not pitch black. It's still pretty dark, but not pitch black. If they were double the thickness I think that would do the trick. But again, for my needs it does work pretty darn well with the combination of blinds and these curtains.

I ordered 2 different types of curtains because I wasn't sure which one i would like best.  These curtains ;lost, and only because i have a bunch of different patterns in bedding and it got to busy.  They were very nice though

I wanted curtains that are blackout and hold heat in and cold out or vice-versa! I wanted curtains that gave my room character. Well I got them and Im very satisfied.  They are not as thick as normal blackout curtains but honestly I'm happy with that.  Most of those are a bit heavier and I dread moving them or reinstalling them in different places in my house. So these are convenient! If you want nice ombre curtains that do keep the light out and give lots of character tgen these curtains are definitely worth every penny! They came with 6 other items I bought fir my birthday so I was very pleased they came on time üòÄ ‚ò∫  They are exactly what your looking at in pictures and tgey have a heavier cloth/Silky-smooth  feeling to them! ü•∞  hope my review helps you figure out what you want but this is best buy for your bargain üòâ üòÑ

I recently painted my entire room because I wanted to go a simple gray neutral color and these really set off the design I really really really like them I like them so much I purchased a similar set from a different vendor for a shower curtain version so that I can make both rooms cohesive Great price great quality I don't see anything wrong with them try them out for yourself.

They're very pretty and definitely room darkening, but not blackout. Using for my baby's nursery and they let in too much light for her daytime naps

While I love the curtain‚Äôs design the ombr√© color is very subtle. Not as it shows in the advertisement. They‚Äôre still great looking so I decided not to take a point off for it. Also they‚Äôre not blackout curtains. It blocks most light but not the way or as much as true blackout curtains does.

I really like the color of these curtains, however,  it doesn't block the light completely.

I am changing my bathroom colors to match the tile. I am going for black, gray, and white. My issue is that I bought these curtains in black. It‚Äôs supposed to fade from gray to black. The curtain colors look to be in the brown family. As you can see in the picture, my toilet paper holder is black and the curtains don‚Äôt match. The order did come fast and easy to put on the rod.

I have no regrets about buying these. They are gorgeous and they look good in my window. Plus instead of being too long they stop right at the windowsill the way I have always wanted. I wouldn't call them 100% blackout. More like 90%, which is good enough for me!

The curtains are excellent about the quality and job they claim they do but the color is a little off, meaning lighter than the images shown.  Still keeping them.  Thanks.

These are very nice curtains. The fabric is heavy and soft and they block out daylight quite well, however the gradient of the color fade is not nearly as dramatic as the pictures might suggest, or at least not with the black curtains that I purchased. Either way, they are still pleasant to look at and seem to be of good quality.

Theses are thick not thin. They are pretty but they are much darker then the picture. It's hard to see the ombre at first I thought they sent the wrong drapes because it's that hard to see the difference in blue. The cost was more then I thought they were worth so I'm regretting purchase some but I needed them and don't have time to return and wait for another pair

I was looking for blackout curtains that had some subtle, elegant design to it.  I saw this and loved that aside from the subtle damask design, it had gradient color from light to dark.  HOWEVER, while I love that it does the job in darkening the room and has that subtle damask design,  the drapes came in one shade of blue color not a progressive light to dark blue as advertised.

I bought these for my living room and they look nice and fit in perfectly. I've tried twice to reorder another set to cover my patio doors but every new set I've recieved does not have the ombre look, they are a solid grey color. So strange that I order the same curtains 3 times and get 3 different sets. Back they all go.

Quality is great. However I wouldn‚Äôt call these blackout. Many blackout drapes are heavy & their material is often heavy & scratchy. These drapes have a soft silky feeling to them & do a very good job of blocking out the light. The ombr√© effect is beautiful. I own these in the blue & grey.

The pink ombre curtains are very pretty. Slightly darker in color everywhere than pictured on Amazon. Wanted blackout curtains for the toddler's room, and didn't achieve total blackout, but did darken significantly compared to our old curtains, so will still be keeping them.

They do keep out a lot of light but they are not black out curtains. They are silky soft. Pretty colors. I like these a lot. I would not buy them if you need total black out tho. They are nice.UPDATE after a few months, the sides that fold over so they are in direct sunlight----are fading!!! They are no longer blue but purple!!! Note that any side facing the sun will fade!!! and quickly

Very nice material,  they came wrinkle free. A little darker then the picture.  Well worth the buy. Very happy  with the product.  Looking to get a set for the family room door wall.  In the blue color.

They were nice curtains but I decided to go with another color & returned them

I really like these curtains. The pictures don't capture the true darkness, maybe cuz my phones old. But all these pictures were taken at 10am in the morning. Hopefully I helped you make a decision. The pictures with my dogs are examples of the darkness in my room. I got pink and it's dark in my room so the colors may be even darker.

they are very good quality and block most on the light. the only issue is the color. it is more of mid gray to black and not white to black like the photos show.

These curtains cute. If you are hoping for black out curtains, these are not for you.

Loving the ombre effect. Don't think it's black-out, but also not purchased for that reason. Material feels silky and is not heavy. Slides easily along rod.Would probably look best ironed. The length of our windows are an in between size so I shortened them 4 inches. Comes with white stitching along the bottom hem. No tie-backs included.

They are well-made, no loose strings or visible stitching, and the grommets are solid. They do well at blocking light, and the room was perceptibly less drafty as soon as I got them up. They also dampen noise well.They are not the prettiest. I mean, they‚Äôre not ugly, the yellow is a lovely warm color, but there‚Äôs something about them that makes them look a bit like hotel room curtains. But, you know, a nice-ish hotel, not a cheap motel.They do the job though.

Love the feel and look of the curtains. My only complaint...in real life the ombre is darker than in photos. I added a pic and laughed when my photo was similar in color to the color online, however to the naked eye the top and design are not as light. Beautiful pattern. I am glad I didn't paint the livingroom yet. I am going to go with a lighter gray to brighten up the room because the curtains darken the feel of a room.

Quality is excellent. Pattern is nice. Fabric is thick and opaque. Overall a great curtain. However, I ordered pink ombr√© expecting shades from cotton candy to fuschia as the photos show. It‚Äôs more of a pale salmon to mauve and doesn‚Äôt go with my green walls.

I love the look of these curtains, but they are not as blackout as I wanted or am use to.

Curtains look nice, and are true to the description; however they are not 100% blackout.

The color in the stock photos isn't the actual color of the curtains.  As pictured, it appears to be a vibrant yellow to orange ombre.  The actual color is a pale yellow to deep yellow.  The quality though is very well made and they do block a lot of light.

Just what I expected

I wish they weren't so stiff, otherwise they are great.

Good quality excellent fitting

We got these for the Living Room windows. Really well stitched, and nice coloring. Interesting pattern keeps them pleasantly accepted. The wife really likes them, she's quite happy with them. 5 stars

I really like these just the right length andI like that the colors flow with change

Just what I had in mind

Size,light block

Very nice buy

Having moved to a south side apartment, with a bright street light out front, which also has a noisy highway near by, these curtains really do the trick. Got a good night sleep for the first time in a week.

Very pretty

The material is a really good quality, the curtains are stunning, and they block a lot of outside light. I highly recommend these curtains.

Absolutely love this curtain , perfect size and color

They hang great really know creases are wrinkles after about a day

These curtains are just as pictured.  I love the way the color changes gradually from light to dark blue.  Great weight, fabric is soft and lined.  They look great in my windows.  We have really wide windows so we needed 4 panels for each but it was great because each package contained two panels so we only had to buy 2.

These work real well with my color scheme for my dining room.

Perfect size/ color in my room

Absolutely love these drapes. I love how the black fades into a transition of gray from bottom to top. I had them cut bc they were too long. They are perfect in my newly renovated master bedroom

These curtains are made with quality fabric and look eloquent in our dining room.

look good ... I like the it

Awesome curtains! I love them! Great quality!

Check out my video. I‚Äôve had them hanging for months, and they still feel brand new, to me. I catch myself staring at them, still. Lol. Good light blocking, smooth, rich-feeling, fabric.  I did iron them to get the gold creases out. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with them. Great addition to my bedroom!

It‚Äôs better in person than what is shown. Great fabric and slight pattern for the price. Its not a total blackout but it‚Äôs fine with me and this pic is taken at noon. I‚Äôm thrilled!

These stylish curtains are so beautiful. I originally bought the gray ones and decided to update my abode. The ombre purple and red are a great way to add a pop of color without going full Mardi Gras or making it feel like a circus. I absolutely love the pattern and the weight of the fabric, I can hang them up right out of the packaging as they have minimal wrinkles. I am keeping the original ones to use as room dividers or maybe a stylish outer shower curtain. The large holes at the top allow for plenty of options for mounting.

Fits well on patio door

Love the ombre color very nice quality  will buy again

These curtains are the exact dimensions as described and true to the color shown online. They feel as if they will last a long time and sufficiently block out light. They are heavy and silky. Really like these!

Love Love Love these curtains.  Very good quality!!!!

These are a great value. I bought the lighter blue and the color is surprisingly the same as the photos. They are heavy, wrinkle resistant  (I hung them right out of the box and there were no wrinkles, not even from the folds) and they look great. I'm happy I bought these.

These brown ombre curtains are very beautiful. The material is silky soft, the damask pattern is classy but not too bold, and the ombr√© color pattern is beautiful. The back of the curtains are lined with white material, so they look neutral from the outside. These curtains more than met my expectations! I ordered 120‚Äù X 84‚Äù Length (set of 2 panels) to fit my sliding glass door. It is a little more than double the size of my sliding glass door, so there is plenty of material to make pleats to hang nicely when the curtains are closed. I bought metal curtain tie back hooks, that match my curtain rod, to hold the curtains open to let in light during the day, since they are room darkening. This also makes my cat happy. Buy these curtains! You will love them!

Beautiful

These curtains look so good in my bedroom, we‚Äôve lived here 12 years finally found the right curtains

Looks great and rich color

These curtains are not only beautiful  but functional as well

Great quality! I bought one pair to try and loved them so much that I bought 2 more sets. Had them for 3 years and they are are still looking like the day I bought them. They also held up well after being dry cleaned! Thank you

Just got these curtains this afternoon and my immediate reaction is extremely positive. We recently bought a gray damask duvet cover and knew that matching the shades of gray online would be nearly impossible. So this ombr√© pattern was perfect, as it offers a range of bluish grays, which included our duvet.The fabric is nice and the print is clean. They‚Äôre not as thick as the curtains I typically think of when I see ‚Äúblack out;‚Äù however, these do filter out a good amount of light and they sort of ‚Äúglow‚Äù when backlit. We have them hanging in front of a set of sheers, so we might double up on those to filter out even more light.Speaking of doubling up, if you have a wide window, you will likely need two sets or more (depending on the width you order) if you like a fuller gather on the rod. I knew this would likely be the case, but I wanted to confirm a decent color match and fabric quality before committing to two sets.Overall, I am very please. I am curious to see if these help to keep our bedroom any cooler in the summer or any warmer in the winter.

Really like the color and style

I used in bathroom as add on to shower rod for decorative look outside of liner, using two rods. Wanted something with color and not busy looking, this delivers for me!!

Ok, so we're having the inside of the house painted and I decided I absolutely need new curtains. I've started with these for my bedroom. The whole front wall is windows, which not only catch the very bright morning sun, but would allow passersby to see into the bedroom. These arrived yesterday, so I literally took them out of the box and hung them. A few wrinkles, but they'll come out. And they look beautiful! One test left to do tonight when it's dark... I'll turn on the bedroom lights, go outside and look in, but I doubt I'll see anything. These are thick. Holding them up to my face I couldn't see anything through them. And so soft. Yes, buy them!One photo shows half the curtains open, half closed. The other is fully closed.

These drapes are beautiful on my slider! They brighten up the living room! Very well made. I am pleased with them.

I love these. They are definitely blackouts and just what I needed in my living room to keep it nice and dark with my huge windows. Very happy with these and will be purchasing again if I need more!

I really like these curtains! The ombre look is subtle but still unique. They are not 100% black-out, but close. They don't allow a glare on tv and they provide great privacy at night. Overall for the price, I'm happy! üòä

I rarely write reviews but these curtains are so nice! They are the first ones I've bought that were not wrinkled at all, and they're made really well. The rod holders make them so easy to hang. I have a very wide window and they fit perfectly. Would highly recommend!

I've been looking for something with the perfect color the perfect length everything. And these are it. I love that they have such a wide variety of choices. The texture is nice The color is perfect and it isn't too heavy And they do not look or feel cheaply made. I'd recommend purchasing them.

These curtains are beautiful! The the color transition and the pattern. They definitely block out the light and cold air! Highly recommend

These curtains are so beautiful. They go so good in my living room. They block the sun when I need them too. I love the material they used to make them because I know they will last a long time.

This is a very nice material that's quite heavy too.  It doesn't wrinkle and it does block the light.  I have the ivory with metallic gold marks which is very pretty for a bedroom and/or living room if they matched your decor.  Quite happy with these.

I originally wrote a scathing review as I didn't care for these curtains, they just aren't to my taste; however, I will say this - they do offer a wide variety of sizes and colors, the price is very reasonable, and they arrived very quickly. While I wasn't happy with the product, the seller reached out to me immediately to see if there as anything they could do. I had no problem setting up a return.All in all, while I didn't care of the fabric, I've dealt with many vendors through Amazon who were terrible. This one is pretty decent.

These aren't blackout curtains despite being advertised as such. They're just thick, but they don't block out enough light. And the size isn't accurate at all. Both sizes I ordered didn't match up to the product description. The one in the picture is supposed to fit a 42" window and it doesn't even come to the bottom of the sill.

I purchased two panels that were supposed to be 60‚Äùx63‚Äù. As you can see, one panel is half the size of the other! This issue is augmented by the fact that I have to get an extension ladder to reach the height of these windows. I am not pleased with this issue at all.

They are thin and let light in. I also don‚Äôt like the look of the drawstrings so I‚Äôll likely cut that part off. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre looking for blackout curtains.

Got these for my daughters downRoom. Opened too late to return. They are not blackout blinds!!!!

These do not filter out all of the light. It shines right through them. Thin fabric.

Though the packaging makes clear these cannot be returned if they are worn, etc., I'm returning them. They are terrible: tiny vertical lines of grease throughout, and a 2" one, VERY VISIBLE ON THE FRONT, on one panel. At first I'd thought the marks could be ironed out??? Nope. They are likely machine grease, made apparently by brush strokes?? On BOTH panels. No way can I make these work. I refuse to lose money on these. Terrible quality, no quality control. If I knew how to upload a photo from my phone, I'd do it.

There nice but definitely won‚Äôt buy again

The second set is significantly lower quality and can see the light through. Disappointing!

I ordered this new and they were great. Tried to order them used and I don‚Äôt even get the same curtains and they came with a hole. I knew they were used but didn‚Äôt expect what I got. They don‚Äôt even have the rings where they go on the curtain, you have to shove the pole through them

This is not a blackout curtain. This is shown over an existing blind that is pulled down and there is still light filtering through. I‚Äôll be returning to find something better.

The color and fabric of these curtains are very nice. They are absolutely NOT blackout curtains. They are sheer and allow tons of light and shadows though. Very false advertising. Fabric not thick enough to block the light at all.

Not blackout curtains  at all. Also  size seems off. Even if you order 42 wide for 35 wide windows. does not cover

My item is too short.

Not long at all

These are NOT blackout curtains at all. They filter some light, but they do it block it at all. I believed their description and purchased because I liked the tie around look and need blackout curtains for my son. But these only block about 1/4 the light, and that‚Äôs when they‚Äôre in front of another layer of curtains!

These arrived today and after installing them I was disappointed at the fact that they look more like a shower curtain. They look different in the examples shown. Will be returning them.

Purchased 2 pair and quality and control is horrible. I got 2 different black.

I bought the ivory colored curtains, it did NOT block sunlight.My room receive direct sunlight in the summer. These curtains did not block the sun, there was a "glow" from the sunlight falling on the curtains.

These are cute and they are the color I wanted but they don‚Äôt block light at all. Don‚Äôt buy if you need black out!

Arrived dirty and a mess

Not true blackout. Does not block out the light and was sent with stains and dirt all over them

If you are buying blackout curtains, the goal is to have them block the light. These do not. See the picture, and see the light coming through the curtains, throwing red colors onto the wall.None of the other features matter if the curtains don't do the job they were purchased for.For those who don't care about the blackout function - The material is a cheap looking slippery polyester.

The two panels are 2 different colors and 2 different fabrics.

i got ‚Äúblush pink‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt even pink, it was a peach , and the things to tie it on the back doesn‚Äôt look anything like the picture, the fabric looks cheep and i js felt like it wasn‚Äôt worth $30.

Definitely blocks out harsh hot sun when closed. I really like the deep dark color and the tie backs are definitely a plus. I noticed it does keep out the cold weather too since our windows are so old they do bring in cold air. These are nice and for the price, you can't go wrong. Nicely sewn too .. Quick Shipping!

These are well made curtains with nice soft material and hang well. Not too heavy. Right out of the package there were few wrinkles. Blocking the sun and heat well so far. Not 100% like the heavier ones but they look very nice.

They are truly ‚Äúblackout‚Äù curtains.The room is cooler now that these were hung.The color is vibrant and they added the perfect touch.

They definitely help reduce light, although I wouldn't call them a true black out curtain. They're soft, come with big rings that make hanging them easy, and have ties on the side to help keep them out of the way. The color is exactly what was showcased, and it was a great addition to my bedroom.

Very nice curtains. They are good quality. Well worth the money

I love the color. They're very lightweight. They keep out the light. They go up very easily and I love how soft they are. The fabric is very nice

These are perfect for when my bf works nights and needs to sleep in the day! Or sleeping in on our days off! Pretty too! I love that they have attached tie backs!

Good fabric, color true to picture, easy to get wrinkles out with the dryer. Fit perfectly on my windows. No complaints. Would order more.

The curtains are ok. The rings (holes) put me in the mind of shower curtains lol and they aren‚Äôt as wrinkle resistant.! Overall, it‚Äôs a good deal for the price

These are good curtains. They do wrinkle a bit but overall it‚Äôs ok, and they do block a good amount of light. I really wanted them for how light they are and I couldn‚Äôt find any store in person to buy shorter curtains. However they are not blackout curtains.

I ordered four sets of these curtains, two sets of two different sizes... and these smaller ones are brighter but also glossy/shiny material and the other ones are darker and matte. So be warned that the different sizes are also different shades and materials. Very disappointing. But they do black out windows.

fabric is heavy, but seems to be sewn crooked and not along the grain.  The sides don't hang straight, making the look not what I expected.

Wanted total blackout curtains. Husband works graveyard, so needs daytime dark. Too much light still comes through these

They are nice but don't block out any light. I have to buy a liner for behind it.

The quality is nice but these curtains do not block light completely. Disappointed will return.

These are NOT blackout!

These are absolutely not black out. Light filtering but that‚Äôs not what I was looking for

I don't care that these curtains are made of a cheap plasticky fabric, nor that the color is quite a bit lighter than the rich burgundy red shown on the detail page. I chose these because the seller claims...."Blackout Performance & Energy Saving: Triple weaved blackout curtains can block out most of sunlight and harmful UV rays."As you can see from the photo, these are not blackout curtains.

I am an overnight dock manager so I need blackout curtains to help me stay asleep till 3pm so I can work from 6:30pm to 5am.These curtains look nice but don‚Äôt blackout the room. So much light creeps in that it‚Äôs hard for me to stay asleep. I am keeping these and putting them in another room but they just won‚Äôt do for my bedroom.

fine curtain, color a little off from actual picture. But will work fine.

They are cute but it didn‚Äôt work for my window, I have to send it back and order a longer one.

Color and material as described but as picture shows, not a true black out curtain.

I ordered the Silver Grey, which looked like a pale shade of grey. They are much darker in real and are a gloomy storm grey. The quality is nice though, and creases come out easily with a pass of the iron.  The attached ribbons are great. And the curtain comes in lots of sizes including shorter lengths. The misleading color is the reason for 3 stars instead of 5.

Fabric, fine. Color, good. Blackout, acceptable. Hem...weird. Left side of each panel is 3 inches shorter than right right. Need to break ot the sewing machine.

Quality of the material feels weird to the touch personally. But it does do the job of keeping the light out. Was decent enough to keep

These are not blackout curtains, they dim the light but do not block out the light completely.  They come wrinkled out of the package and need to be pressed.  For the price, they are decent looking.

The media could not be loaded.
                



I measure from top to bottom and it was about 5 -10 inches off what I was supposed to buy and they are not black out sadly.

These were too thin and i didnt like the way the draw strings looked when not in use. I returned them.

These are decent quality for the price, but far from ‚Äòblackout.‚Äô Maybe the color I chose makes a difference, but it shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and I doubt the sun shines brighter on my house üòõ

I ordered 6 packages of curtains at the same time hoping for color and size consistency.  That did not happen. There are 2 different ‚Äúblacks‚Äù and the lengths are not the same. Some of the sections drag on the ledge (and yes the rod is level and even)

They don‚Äôt block out all the light.  In fact, the description and picture shows a layer of black material in the middle.  The beige curtains  are one med weight layer, no black layer.  They do block out some light due to the medium weight and how they are hung.  If you get a wide enough set, more cinched material will let it in less light.  One curtain tie was not sewn correctly.  I would have sent it back but they were already hung.

Love color.  Just can‚Äôt get wrinkles out

Curtains definitely provide privacy we were looking for.  Not quite the quality expected but they do the job

The curtains are as promised but with one extra we didn't ask for. The odor!They smell very strongly of very bad, cheap perfume. It was overwhelming. My husband and I are very sensitive to stong smells like this and I immediately had to put them in the wash. I'm guessing these were used and returned then shipped to me. There is no other way they could have this smell coming from the manufacturer or factory.

I can still see light

The curtains look nice and the color is spot on to the add.  The "black out" is lacking, the curtains looks almost like cheese cloth with the light shining through.

They look nice and feel of good quality. But once hung are considerably narrower than the specs. Bought the 60" wide panels and once hung on the rod only cover about 53". Unfortunately he 2 panels don't cover my 108" window completely.

Sadly, the advertised size is incorrect.  The dimensions of the curtains I received were 84L and 58W (not the 60W as advertised).  I ordered this particular curtain because I needed the 60 inches in width for two windows.The material itself is not bad.  I just wished the seller would state the correct size of their curtains.

The fabric is nice but the quality of the sewing all around the edge is look like it's done by 12 years old in the garage. Not even sewed pattern around the edges, sewed just one line simple sewed all around making it low quality. Disappointed about this item.

These curtains are pretty good at what I bought them for (reducing heat in a room),  and the color is nice. But the combination of grommets, cheap-looking fabric, and ugly hem makes them look like something from a motel. They also snag very easily so I don't feel like I can return them. Ended up getting another product instead.

The color is nice and the fabric feels good, but the bow does not tie like in their pic. It looks uneven and makes the curtains bunch up weirdly. So my daughter just let‚Äôs them hang, which is fine, but wish I hadn‚Äôt gotten the ones with the bow.

Work

Great color and weight but when sunshine comes through the window there are several ‚Äúholes‚Äù and runs where there are flaws in the blackout.  They look fine at night but it looks pretty bad when closed during the day

Do NOT black out sunlight. Although well made and the material is a nice quality.. That big orange ball shines through on a sunny day. If you truly want black out curtains... You might choose those brands that have that foam padding on one side.

These are not complete blackout curtains. Pinpoints of light show through holes on these curtains and they are not insulating. The advertised description is misleading.

I had to add a black trash bag to my window to get the full black out ‚Äúexperience‚Äù

Item width was not what was listed

Disponible not as excepting

Great looking curtains- color is nice as is the fabric. But they are not black out at all. Very disappointed.

Nice curtains, the shade was a lil off (color) wrinkle-free they are not! As far as Blackout light it serves a purpose.

So the curtains aren't that bad but be wary that light does pierce through it. There‚Äôs tiny holes and they are visible. They do keep the room dark better than these other curtains I got target. Doesn‚Äôt look like high quality material though.

Fairly well made and a lot less in cost then trying to get them locally but they are not black out curtains. They do reduce the light coming in, somewhat, maybe 50%. The window in the picture is on the North side of the house so that isn‚Äôt the Sun coming through, just light from outside.

Love them but need find black out rod for them at a better price these were a steal only $13 ‚ù§ big discount will get more update later bought another set for living room

It blocks the light but it is a little thin in my opition. It is wrinkle free though.

The quality is all right üëç I'm satisfied how well this curtains blocks sun light. However 1 major flaw is the way how the curtains are stuffed in its packaging completely eliminate the wavy style that the stock photo shows.

They feel good quality, easy hanging the ties are sewed on one side so you can always tie them or untie them. I like them tide. That‚Äôs why I bought them. I‚Äôm very happy with them.

I needed bedroom curtains . These were the right color and size. Also easy to hang !

Perfect.

The product is great.

These are very soft. Not sure they are the best for blackout. Also, after washing and dryer, wrinkles and fold lines were difficult to steam iron out.

The media could not be loaded.
                



These blackout curtains actually black out the light as advertised. I really need to steam these though, shipping made them wrinkly. I got them for my newborn's room, so he will sleep into the morning after going to bed late at night. So far they are working great. The color is exactly as expected, a beautiful forest green color.

These curtains are easy to install and look like they‚Äôll last. The fabric is thick and these curtains do a great job blocking the afternoon sun.

Ok, I'm not a room darkening person so I was hesitant to buy.  I was right. For me these curtains did not work. For someone who wants total darkness, maybe for u! Quality was good, price was good.

I love them they are awesome and literally are black out so happy with that. They pick up animal hair sooooo easy though like super static cling. But I love them still.

It does keep my room dark.

I bought these to drown out the lights from outside, they‚Äôre not 100% blackout but still very nice.

These are very thick unlike some other brands that are at a similar price point

Color almost as shown, just a little lighter. Blocks light.

I bought these because I thought the color would go well with the door in my Shed/Office. It matched up pretty good. I did however change out the grommets from silver to black. I had to do it on 8 panels two for each window.Giving it four stars because I don't like the curtains can snag so easily. I had to be extra careful when taking off the metal grommets. I really like the overall look. üëç

These are beautiful curtains. The color and the way they fall is gorgeous but they are not excellent as blackout curtains. They block quite a bit so they work great for my living room but I wouldn't use them in the bedroom.

I bought the  W42"xL63" | Color: Greyish White ones to held keep out light and noise from a 6 foot wide 71" high bedroom window. I put them behind existing miniblinds which alone are not sufficient for either. The curtains were able to cover almost the width when fully expanded (i dont plan to ever open/close them) and are a few inches short in height. They are helping a lot with both light and noise (but doesnt completely eliminate either).  Darker colors might have removed all the light, but i dindt want a constant black background showing outside in the windows.

the fabric is a different quality than u‚Äôd expect. works well though to block out light.

It's so close to being completely dark

I had a difficult time finding panels that were wide enough for my window but were also only 63" long. The width of the panels fit my window just right. My only complaint is that the seems of the curtains did were not pressed neatly. They appear to have not been pressed before being packaged. Some wrinkling is expected in packaging but this was beyond what I would expect. Otherwise, the quality of the product is good.

normally, it can be hard to find blackout curtains that aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ugly, if we‚Äôre being honest. you either get a satisfying appearance or you get blackout. i liked that these do a good job at blocking light, but aren‚Äôt hard on the eyes. they also aren‚Äôt so heavy, thick and stiff; they tie back and move around smoothly. the built in ties are very convenient.

Curtains are great in my living room. Light blocking, easily slide with grommets to allow light in during the day & when closed at night affords privacy. Nice weight to fabric. Not too heavy it too light weight. Color vibrant. Only complaint is that they do need to be ironed or steamed before hanging.

The colors were great and the curtains were a great fit for our windows. Black and Dark Green are the colors.

Works for our guest room.

The fabric is lighter than I thought it would be it does blackout most of the light but not all

Great curtain for the price, is a nice smooth material and thickness is great. I‚Äôll be buying another set.

They do a good job of blocking out most of the light without being too heavy

It‚Äôs only 1 piece

Even after steaming,it still didn't take all the fold marks

They were wrinkled coming out of the package,  I haven't washed them yet, maybe that will make the difference,  but they have been hanging for three weeks over the heat and still wrinkled.

Bought fir my room  blackout curtains working their magic!!

these really work and keep out the light, they are light weight.  they are just like they describe them. i would buy again

Very nice for the price!

As for overall look, these are just okay... fairly heavy/basic.  For me, I'm realizing I would have preferred no ties.  (I, of course, did not remove a star for that as I knew these would come with ties.)  For me, I either have the curtains closed all the way, or all the way open.  I'll likely try to cut the ties off so they're not 'just hanging there'.These do completely block light coming through.  I have them on patio doors with (otherwise) a lot of sun coming in that was really heating up the house.  These have made a huge difference in allowing our a.c. to do it's thing on hot days!

The fabric quality is a no for me compared to the price. Each curtain has 2 tiebacks with the same fabric sewn on both sides of the curtain.

Not 100% blackout but did make the room darker Than what it was

Not 100% darkness but plenty good for sleeping during the day. they look nice. tiebacks are a handy feature.

Went up easy and knock down the light and heat

They're great blackout curtains for people who need to sleep early or during the day.

Bedroom is totally dark

Cute color buy 2 sets

No light pass through them whatsoever! I love them!

Nice

Good quality curtains

Good price and quality.üëçüèº

Satisfied with the quality and price.  Used to spending an arm and a leg to get quality drapes only to have them destroyed by pets and heavy daily use.  I like the idea of being able to relax and not worry about the wear and tear and just enjoy my house.  The look is very similar if not the same, and my judgemental family and friends and have not said a word!!!

Live how dark it gets into the room.

These shades went perfect in my bedroom. The color matched the unique blue color of the walls. They do a good job of blacking out the sun in the morning. They are beautiful and classy perfect for any room from a baby room for a boy to a Couples room

Blocks the light well, easy to hang, I like the ties attached.

My daughter is a day sleeper and she needed some blackout curtains.  These curtains are a nice quality fabric and really do block out the light nicely.  She's very happy with them.

These work well as blackout curtains, are quality weight, easy to install, and a great color. Not too wrinkly and a great fabric!

Vivid color I love

Fits my window very nicely. Color is rich and has a nice sheen to it. Very soft. Darkens the room quite well.

Beautiful deep color, well made and so worth their money.

Nice product but I need a size longer so will have to do a return.

I have an odd schedule and I sleep during the day, so this was perfect for being able to sleep when the sun is out. They block sunlight really well and they fit my window perfectly. They are pretty thick and a little heavy, which makes them good quality.

I have bought these curtains for a bedroom and now for a bathroom and they are very nice curtains. The prices are very good and they are good quality curtains

Perfect size for my daughter's window. It blocks the heat out pretty well and it doesn't make the room that dark at all. I recommend this product.

These are much thinner and lighter than I expected, I was expecting them to be thick and heavy. So when I opened them I wasn't sure they would do the job. But they do the job perfectly! They block out most of the sun and help keep some of the heat out.

Looks beautiful in my daughter‚Äôs room! It doesn‚Äôt block light all the way but you can always layer it with a dark color but to be honest it‚Äôs dark enough for my daughter‚Äôs room. It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle (at least not for me)It‚Äôs nice and thick, and I feel like it was a great price! Also, super soft!

Great, thick and truly backs out the light.

The fabric is so soft and it drapes perfectly on the window!  Love it

Easy to hang with the large grommets.

These panels are vibrant and do exactly what they are supposed to do. They keep the heat out when closed and they are the perfect fabric and weight.

Heavy and well made I was pleasantly surprised and will order more curtains from this company

I'm a maintenance engineer that works graveyard shift so I have to sleep through the afternoon. I live close to the beach so I have my storm shutters closed but one window doesn't have them so I bought these and they do the trick. My room on a 95 degree sunny day is actually pretty dark

The media could not be loaded.
                



Nice curtains will get them again just longer

The curtains are a great deal. Amazing quality and beautiful color. It‚Äôs even strong enough to hold up against my daughter‚Äôs cat and his claws.

BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS THEY LOOK SO NICE WASN'T EXPENSIVE AT ALL THAT'S WHY I SAY LOOK'S GOOD.HANGING AT THE WINDOW WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE BEDROOM NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE I PURCHASED THEM FROM AMAZON PLUS IT WAS DOUBLE CURTAINS.FOR THE PRICE.I GOING TO PURCHASE AGAIN BUT IN ANOTHER COLOR

Omg I love these curtains,  bold bright colors. Thick fabric for light blocking , some wrinkles would benefit from ironing first. Love the ties is a nice accent

These are really nice curtains, they keep out the light, a great value for the money.

Love how they look and they blocked out the light love love love them!

Let‚Äôs some light in, but excellent privacy coverage. Two large corner windows in master bath. Need privacy, but wanted something that had a look of quality. Perfect length, no hemming required. Also love the ‚Äúbuilt in‚Äù tie backs.

I ordered Ivory, but I'd describe them as a little darker, maybe a Cafe Latte color. When the sun shines, they turn beautiful shades of beige and sun-lit brown. They are much more high quality than expected. The first morning, I realized the value of blackout curtains because I slept longer than usual.

The only curtain I have had so far that actually darkens the room! And love that I can wash AND dry them with no problem. Love how the tie-backs are attached to the curtain itself too, so I don't lose them! Would purchase again!

Easy to hang,  perfect thickness, length was perfect.  Blocks light and they are soft

I like that these curtains are one fabric (no heavy liner) but provide excellent light blocking. The material is silky, soft and a nice color.

These are very nice curtains with a cute bow to tie them when you want them out of the way. Very good quality.

The pink was the prefect shade that I was looking for. The material feels great and the quality is overall excellent for the price.

Good quality. Keeps out the light, heat and cold. Very nice.

The wide width made them perfect for my extra large living room window. I did not need multiple sets in order to cover the whole window. There were a few wrinkles from packaging but after 2 days hanging, most have fallen out so no need to take them down for ironing. Light water mist should take care of the rest. Light dirt smudges easily wiped away with damp towel too.Color-The white is a bright white which offsets my light blue walls perfectly. The blackout is 100% even though the lining is a light to medium gray not black. I checked both inside and out with sunlight (east-facing window) and bright led lights at night.My husband is very happy now that he can watch movies without random rays of light hitting the TV screen and I'm happy that people can no longer see inside my windows at night since it faces the street/sidewalk with regular vehicle and foot traffic.This was an excellent choice!

Recommended 100% high quality, light blocking, perfect and nice window coverage! Received in 1 day. It exceeded my expectations!

The quality is good and the color is a actual true white. They do very well on blocking the outside light and I love the look feel and appearance of them. They have a good weight and thickness especially for the price I think this is a very good deal for your money. The only small issue I have is one of mine came with a smudge of dirtiness on it. No huge deal since it was small but it is kind of an eyesore since it's at the very top. I do plan on trying to get it out one day.

These are really good curtains that block out light. I really like that they are sized for the size of the window which is twice the width of the window. Some curtains from other companies are the size of the curtain laid flat which is not enough material to cover the window. The one thing that I don‚Äôt like is how much heat comes through.

Amazing curtains. Complete blackout even in a cashmere color. Quality of the material is excellent and found them in unique sizes that were hard to find else where. Will order more!

Normally I don‚Äôt write reviews, but needed to write a quick on on these! These curtains literally are the best black out curtains we have had. It covers 100% to the point where we slept through our alarm the first night we had them set up! The price and size is great for what we needed! Would buy more in the future!!First picture is at 10am with our lamp on as it is now needed and the second is with no lights on again at 10am, the curtains allow only what YOU want to allow in, nothing else!

So excited this really works...just barely hear a hum instead of the roar of traffic.  Also kept the room much warmer.  Great purchase...buying it again.

Just as described and seemed to be well made. Looked nice when we hung them.

The product is well made and as described EXCEPT for the color.  Advertised as "cream".  IT IS NOT CREAM but a bright white.  I would hate to see the "white".

I washed them on gentle cycle before hanging. I cut my finger on one of the grommets and blood dripped on them. I then noticed most of the grommets were bent. I assume it happened during the wash. The material is similar to indoor outdoor pillow fabric. They do block the light but not good quality.

For the price the curtain is to cheap. It does block out light, but not like a 100% true black out curtain. Plus the "blackout" part is like a plastic so it will not hold up. The curtain itself is coming apart at the seams after 1 wash.

I love the material because it falls nicely but of the 2 pairs that I ordered, one pair had a very uneven hem. Since I needed to hem them anyway, I just corrected the hem at the same time.

Product is not very thick or heavy. It seems to block the light, but I don‚Äôt see how it can keep the heat out very well. They‚Äôre very thin.

Material is loud if that makes sense. Like it sounds like a plastic bag ruffling. The material is super rough too

The panel‚Äôs were unevenly sewn. Had to (re)install the brackets at an angle to make them look even!

I like and I don‚Äôt like it's a bit too thick for me and the color is not as white as I wanted  but it‚Äôs ok for now I guess

The curtains are made from some plastic-feeling material. Some of the metal rings came not fully sewn/attached, and there were small stains on the curtains themselves.

I had to put a sheet in between the curtains & the windows to get my room darker. I sleep days and it only helped about 5O%

I knew these would be too long when I ordered them, but I thought they'd be a softer feeling fabric and I was willing to hem them. They're good a blocking out light with the lining, but I didn't like the feel of them. Had to send them back.

these are described as blackout curtains. but blackout curtains with grommets are self-canceling. The grommets leave a lot of room for sunlight to bleed in through the window. additionally when you open your curtains or close your curtains because those grommets slide so easily on the rod the curtains don't stay open and they don't stay closed they just basically hang where they hang. super irritating. if you need blackout curtains to really really make your room dark, avoid grommet style.

Pleased with how dark keeps room. Do not care for the grayish tint of the white

Product is of a good quality, blocks light great. However the claim of about 50% noise reduction is a stretch. My guess would be about 15%.

Perfectly fit my room and I like the color and quality. The only thing I don‚Äôt like - they are not 100% blackout and I still have some sunlight that comes through them.

Bedroom.

I'm very happy with the curtains I purchased.  They've made a big difference in blocking the Texas heat. The white helps brighten the room when the curtains are closed. I will order more for other windows.

You may not find these curtains in Beverly Hills, but for the back bedroom they're great.  They're plastic, hold their wrinkles well, but they keep the light out and provide a bit more insulation against cold nights and loud neighbors, so they're worth the money.  Just make sure you get the right size; each panel is 42 inches wide (so combined is 84 inches of curtain), but because they're the style they are you don't get 84 inches of window coverage - it's more like 69 inches of actual window coverage.  They don't tell you that.  It's fine if you have 65-inch windows...  I calculated that you'll get UP TO about 82% of the panel width in actual window coverage.  If you take your window's width (include the sash and frame), divide it by 0.82 (yes, I'm sure), you'll get the approximate minimum total width you need for full coverage.  Get the next size wider.

Thinner than I was expecting and the backside has a light mesh look that I wasn‚Äôt expecting but for the price point they do the job.

These curtains work perfectly for me. I was surprised by how hard white blackout curtains are to find in stores so I took a chance on Amazon. These are excellent for the price. A few wrinkles will need to be steamed out later

We wanted black out curtains in our bedroom because of where our room sat the sun rises right into our room. And no we aren‚Äôt vampires I do enjoy sleeping in on the weekends. The curtains are a good quality. And keep the sunlight out enough for us. It lets some light in.

Definitely block out light. Once I ironed them they looked great!

Hi, it's a really good blackout curtain. I like the material which is white and the lining is grey. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that once installed it looks greyish. And I gave the seller a 5 star rating because it was easy to communicate with them and made sure I was satisfied. Thank you

Don't get me wrong, this curtains are great. Just what I was looking for. The only reason I gift it a 4 stars it's because the curtains are ripped at the bottom

It‚Äôs hard to find white curtains that are blackout, and still appear white! These have a grey liner and that works well! Light comes around the edges but it‚Äôs pretty dark for 3pm on a sunny day. I‚Äôve seen white curtains with the black liner that then no longer appear white. They sound kind of vinyl-like rather than fabric but that is fine! How often do you analyze the feel of your curtains anyways?

Although these curtains are white they are thick enough to be room darkening. They look great in our living area.

These are a great room darkening curtain. The color (dark grey) is true to the photo. They appear to be well made and the grommets are attached nicely. I was able to machine wash and dry. I absolutely had to iron the packing creases before hanging though.

I have to say that I love these curtains! I have them all over my house! I purchased the white, gray, and light gray.  The colors I chose are exactly as expected. They look so good, and so much more expensive than they are. I always use two panels for each side of the window, as the width is narrow, and I like a fuller look. Have I had a few very slight imperfections; yes. However, they are very small, and are easily hidden with placement. I'm not going to exchange them, because you cant see them. I also like to change out my curtains every few years, and for this price I don't feel like I have to keep them forever. Don't be afraid to give them a try!

These work better than any curtains I've purchased to block this Florida heat. I even purchase them as gifts and recommend them to family and friends all the time.

They block out light completely, if they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs the gap above due to rod placement. Also block heat!

No issue at all with the quality of the product and the seller was very prompt in a reply. Learned a lesson that if you are looking for pure white then that needs to be in the description. They absolutely are 100% blackout very minimal wrinkle upon arrival.Had to return them.

These were what I wanted. But not real white looking due to the grey backing. Provide excellent blocking of UV and Heat. Just wish they were whiter. But I blend with grey so looking a little greyish white works.

Very nice quality for the cost. Plan to order again for other rooms. 100% light/heat blocking despite the light weight.

Great

These curtains provided the perfect sunblock to our bright room. Good quality, thickness and overall!

Very dark I like in my kids room

Best blackout curtains I‚Äôve even had

I love the look of these curtains. They fit perfectly in my bedroom. I needed something to blockout light as my bedroom faces a parking lot and I don‚Äôt worry about headlights waking me up.

I love thermal drapes! We live in an older manufactured home and the sun hits on one side of our house all day. Thermal curtains definitely help with cooling rooms and heat in the winter.  I bought these drapes to replace old ones I had purchased at Walmart years ago. I purchased the burgundy ones and the color is very pretty,  curtains are well made and they do block the light as advertised.  I will say much higher quality than the previous drapes and our bedroom is much cooler on these hot days. I actually love these drapes! I wish they carried brown so I could order them for my living room!

I really like these curtains! They really keep my room dark! Wasn‚Äôt sure it they were gonna fit my window luckily they did! My window measurements are 6ft wide X 4ft long . I got the 52‚ÄùW X 84‚ÄùL for reference and the fit perfectly! Hope this helps :)

Trust me they work! If you have second thoughts, don‚Äôt.

Got these for a big bay window for our downstairs TV room.  LOVE these curtains. Will be buying more for another room we have.  They hang really easily and nicely.

I purchased the white curtains for my son, he works late nights and needs to be able to sleep once sun is up.  The curtains keep his room dark, cooler and they help with noise reduction from the street outside his room.  Very happy with the quality of material, nice heavy feel to them.  I would purchase again.

I absolutely love it. Perfect color. And the middle piece which is white is a curtain I already had. But the sides blend in perfect with the white. Also it does blackout.

Good black out court in! Need to get that for the other rooms of my house too it gets dark

Easy to use and they block out all light

They really do black out your room. Sleek, nice simple design.

Loved it, I would definitely buy again in other colors.

The description and pictures do not do these curtains justice, I was very skeptical of these curtains for light, blocking and heat, but they really are good quality and have decreased the heat in the bedroom, and they really do block out the light!

These were exactly the size I needed. Look great and keep the sun out. Perfect.

Perfect for my magical room!  Blocked out all the light and quality is fantastic!

I needed a white curtain to create a calm and clean effect in my room. It was equally as important for it to truly block out light. I am incredibly pleased. It looks very nice, it's made well and I don't have to deal with all the outside lights leaking in the room at night!!

Got these for my baby‚Äôs room because my sister got some for her baby. They really do block out light and she sleeps so much better. Good quality. I‚Äôm going to buy some for the rest of my kids rooms.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE CURTAINS! There extra long so they actually hit the floor. There thick an def keeps the sun out. Going to be ordering more soon!

These budget friendly curtains were perfect for my rental house. They definitely provided noise reduction as well as room darkening. Super easy to hang. Overall, I liked these purchase. Only downside, if you can call it that, hard to iron wrinkles out.

Great product,  and they help black out my house

I really liked the material of this product. Immediately upon putting it up, it absorbed the sun and kept the heat out...nothing but coolness in my home. üòå

Perfect fit

Excellent at blocking out sun and perfect color. Exact length and width as described. Nice touch and feel. Definitely requires ironing or steam dry to remove the wrinkles.

I love these curtains. The material is nice, they hold heat in and they black out light when needed everything I wanted and needed them to do I will definitely be ordering a few more sets for other rooms in the house

They are room darkening and keeping the room cool

Love these curtains.  Heavy, beautiful white, nice flow.

It‚Äôs the right color, but the fabric is very thin and cheaply made. Not worth the trouble  returning it. Hope it lasts a few washes.*** decided to return it. It looks so cheap.

The valance is longer on one side than the other.

I bought 3 curtains and Returned all 3 because I didn‚Äôt like the quality. Now they are claiming that I only returned 2.

See through. Expected thicker material

These are just plain. There is not a fold or pleat to make them look like the picture.

These are sheer! Nothing room darkening about them.

These were not as advertised.  Curtains are sheer and not "energy efficient" as described.

Pretty, however they are very very small and narrow.

One valence was 38‚Äù, one was 39‚Äù and the other was 40‚Äù.  Not one was the correct width. The lengths of all three varied by 1/2 to 3/4 inch so if you are putting them together on one window, be prepared to be very disappointed! Material is thin. I would have sent them back but I had visitors coming and waiting till the last minute to order them. Very disappointed.

Love the selections of valances Amazon has but this one feels cheap and the width wasn't as wide as I thought it would be. All in all I wouldn't buy this style again.

Nothing special! It isnt a block out valance

Material to thin and flimsy.Nit worth the price

Definitely not room darkening - they are very thin and you can see right through them. Stitching is not great either. I guess you get what you pay for.

They are nice but they are pretty thing material.

Ordered 7 valances. Not all were the same length. A few as much as an inch difference.

They were not long enough for whatI wanted them for. But good quality

This is an inexpensive way to get a pop of black in your house.

I bought this for my front door at the top to block the sun. The material is very thin so it doesn‚Äôt do what I hoped it would do to keep the hot sun out but I‚Äôm going to keep it because I like the color just be aware that the material is quite thin.

Pretty yellow but this.

Doesn‚Äôt look like pic very thin

Unless you buy two for each window a regular window won‚Äôt be full like the picture

The material is a little too thin. It lets light though. Looks better then my old one, but I was hoping for it to be thicker.

Just needed that size and color

Pleasantly pleased.

Can totally see through these if looking through them into a lighted environment.

I needed two for one window.

This product has served the purpose .but the thickness of the material could be improved.

Nice material and sized perfectly

Worked great!

Color great a little thin

I bought these for my small basement windows and they work perfect!

I purchased these for my kitchen. As you can see from my pic, you can see light through them. Nice material, look great, and work great for me. I just wanted to warn anyone who is looking for solid material that you do get light through them.

These are ok for what I need them for. I was thinking with a description like blackout tho that they would let a lot less light through.

Clean and neatly hang

Basic gray valance you want gray you got it. Not sure how it says wrinkle free fold lines are prominent. shorter than expected

Very nice!1 A bit more shear than I thought, but they will work

Great curtain and great price. Very easy to hang with a tension rod.Purchased black to hide some electronics. Definitely can‚Äôt see through them.

Hangs nice

I used these to cover the valances in my camper.  Looks great!  Perfect thickness!

This came quickly and the color is bright, exactly what I was looking for.  Material feels good and the size is perfect

Bathroom window

Love this product. Perfect for light blocking in our transom windows as our family room faces west. Thank you very much!

I love them!! Everything  I ordered  no complaints.

Worked great

Perfect for window on the living room door

I bought this color for my new bedspread. And it tied in the pictures I just brought.  I have three sets in the coral for another bedroom match.  I just love these curtains!

The material is fine as well as the color. I‚Äôve not installed them yet! Good value for the money.

I like the looks for window

I loved it for that touch of navy in my kitchen window. I have white and navy blue tile as a back splash and this really made it pop. I ordered another one because it needed the flow gathering. Just one didn't look right. Glad I did.

Ordered this for a friend. Color was perfect. Good quality

I used the curtains in my kitchen. Looks great and good quality for the price

Fit the basement window very well.  Put some privacy in basement room

Got for my mother & its perfect. Simple solid color for her bathroom. Good quality & price. Would recommend.

It‚Äôs no so big as I though, but the color is beautiful.

It is a good length for a window with blinds.  It gives it a nice finished look.

I love them I change my valances at each season so the yellow worked perfect

I liked everything about it.

Nice but wrong color for my needs

Just what I was looking for. They work in my Boys rooms. I ordered 2 pieces for each window. Good for the price !

I like them

Privacy curtain for front door. Perfect size.

These curtains are very well made and the size is on point.  They look great on the smaller windows in my living room

Liked the color

I got this because my boyfriend has a new back door that has 6 small windows on the top. This fits perfectly.

Looks just like what I ordered.  Very nice.

I was disappointed because it didn‚Äôt block out all the light !

Not needed anymore.

Good quality and solid.  Easy to clean.  Keeps heat in.

These do darken the room as described so I cannot fault the curtain in that aspect.  The disappointment with them is basically on me since I ordered the white and they are well, just that, white.  And boring.  Really boring.  There is no design whatsoever to these curtains.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing eye catching.  Nothing that makes you walk into the room and ahhh over.  But again, I ordered the white to "go with" my room.  So, in hindsight, when ordering curtains that are to be used for a functional purpose, not as decor, these are ok.  And who sees them anyway when the lights are off, and the room is darkened??

The curtains look ok hung (see pictures) the backing however is really strange.It's made from a weird material almost like canvas but not? The gesture is really rough feeling and loud when moving the curtains. The backing is in fact black on the inside and white-ish on the outside? It has some integrated curtain ties which are nice.Overall the backing is weird and it's also not connected so it feels like a shower curtain and curtain liner almost.

They are worth the cost.  However be VERY careful ironing them.  They do block out the light.  Would recommend if you are looking for a doable, affordable curtain.

These curtains are truly room darkening, block the draft from windows in my old house.They do need ironing before using and the fabric is slightly bunched at the seams in some areas.I am not sure the built in ties are good idea, they hang weird when curtain is closed so I‚Äôm actually cutting them offI‚Äôm actually buying another pair for the other window in the room

Nice material, not excessively heavy but not thin either. Blacks out the windows perfectly! These curtains are so nice looking. The curtain ties are a plus.One downside is during wash, they tend to turn inside out which is fine just a bit annoying. The other problem is ANY little scratch or damage to the mesh side of the curtain really seems to ruin the blackout of the curtain. My cat just grabbed that side once and now sun seems to peer through that little hole. It‚Äôs noticeable. Easy to damage.Regardless of the downsides, I absolutely love these curtains. Perfect addition to any room.

These curtains look and feel nice. The stitching is excellent, and the cut is straight. The material is soft, and the blackout material is nicely sewn in. The front material is a microfiber that feels a little like velvet. The material itself will tend to get snagged easily (i.e., pet gets its claws in it). I have included a photo where you can see some of the material that has already been pulled before it came to me.It appears this product has 3 layers. The front, the middle blackout layer, and the back plastic netting material. The net material looks white from upclose. I assume this material is added so that the back won't appear too dark. From afar, the back looks gray instead of stark black.The grommets are nicely placed. If you're okay with heavy curtains, and if you think you can avoid snagging this curtain, then I think you'll be quite pleased with these blackout panels. I appreciate that the color on both sides is not too dark.

Very heavy (so use a strong, well supported rod) total blackout curtains. Two layers almost like a fancy shower curtain. The light colored room facing one looks like any other curtain not a dark color that makes it look as though you're in a cave. The window facing layer is completely impenetrable to even the brightest sunlight.My only concern was the fact that the bay window I needed them for has the spring extension rod inside the window frame and sunlight would come through the grommets. I just cut them off and sewed a pocket at the top for the rod to slip through. That should be an available factory option.

Each panel has two tie back strips attached to the sides which could be really helpful for those that do not wish to drill holes for hooks into their windowpanes. The color and length are both good. The black out color is grey. The tie backs can be looped from back to front to create a great look and to let in light.

the main fabric that you see seems to be not that great. it creases super easily. idk, the fabric just doesn't seem curtain-y; it's too smooth. aside from that, it works well to block out light. i just wouldn't make it the focus of my room without ironing it or something

What I especially love about these curtains are the tie backs that are affixed already on each panel. I got them for my daughter's room and love how I can simply tie them back and they look so pretty. I tie a bow on each one and the room looks made up. A really nice quality curtain, great value.

Block out all light and make our room pitch black at night.  Love the gray color.  Great value for price.  Perfect length for our bedroom!

The curtains block the light, and the color is good. Product is as advertised. No flaws in construction.

These are nice room darkening curtians. Mine are white and I pressume darker ones would filter more light. They hang nicely and were easy to iron with steam. The silver grommets look great with my silver rod. 100% pleased.

They‚Äôre great just just described

I‚Äôm very light sensitive and every headlight from a car driving by and the morning sun streaming directly into our bedroom awakened me more times than I could count.  Window blinds just couldn‚Äôt darken the room enough. I used a shower rod to suspend the curtain behind the blinds so I wouldn‚Äôt have to hang a rod and it‚Äôs working perfectly.

I have west facing windows in a brick outside wall and when summertime comes along, the sun is baking those bricks for straight 9 hours.  I got these to cool down my bedroom and they are working great!

The best curtains ever!

These block out direct sunlight completely as long as there are no gaps around the curtains and the interior-facing black color of the curtains is very bold

Good product,  good material

I got these curtains for our guest room to keep the sun out because it is unoccupied most of the time and when we do have house guests, they'll appreciate the blackout ability of these curtains.PROS:  - These curtains provide complete blackout when closed.  The material is very good at completely blocking any light from passing through, which can be extremely helpful for late sleepers because our guest room window faces the morning sun.  - The thickness of the curtains provides some insulating factor both in the winter and in the summer.  These keep the cold drafts next to the window and out of the room in the winter.  On warmer days, the heat from the sun cannot be felt when the curtains are closed.  - These thick curtains muffle sound from the window area.  The normal outside noises are lessened by the weight of these curtains further upping their effectiveness at helping to create a great sleeping environment.  - The curtains look great and feel like they cost quite a bit more.  These curtains are a great value in addition to looking great.CONS:  - This isn't necessarily a negative about the curtains, but the sheer weight of the curtains forced me to put up a better curtain rod that is secured to wall studs.

These blackout curtains do exactly as they should and block out all of the light. They are very well made and very durable. They are also very easy to clean. Excellent product and a great value!

I love these curtains. They're soft, easy hang and they have a nice shape to them. The color is exactly what I needed. They're great quality!

These are real black-out curtains that are made of 3 layers and are super heavy. So heavy in fact that they're too heavy for my current thin rod that has linen curtains. I got these for my bedroom but then thinking I would actually miss light in my room when the curtains are closed, I decided to move them to the living room. I do need to get a new heavy-duty rod for these, in a matching silver color. I'm really excited to put them up as they are well-made and I love the grey color. The material is, interesting. It's very smooth. I need to figure out how to get the wrinkles out of them though. There is a black layer in the middle and some kind of thick white mesh on the reverse. If I was on a ground floor, I wouldn't be thrilled with the mesh on the outside if it was visible to others, but being on a top floor in a tall apartment building, it's fine. I'm looking forward to them insulating the door and window area (that sit next to each other) and living downtown, providing some noise reduction also. I love the ties that are attached as I would have them tied during the day most of the time. Perfect long length too! So happy to have these and I would recommend them for sure!

These curtains are really nice. They are a great weight and drape nicely. I like that they have tie backs built in, which makes it very easy to push them to the side. They look great right out of the box and don't need any steaming.

I'll be adding another set of two of the same drapes for a fuller custom finish to my sunroom.  I am in the process of updating my sunroom, these drapes are the perfect finish to cover the sliding doors for privacy.  The length is perfect at 84" which will allow for the rods to be set higher.  The drapes will barely touch the floor for a more exclusive, custom appearance.I love the attention to detail in the craftsmanship of these drapes, the fabric is heavy and soft, the backing is a lovely material which would look great from the exterior.  The drapes do block the light and elements from penetrating the room, I love the all season versatility, keeping light, draft, heat and even noise out when needed.The grommets are perfectly situated and sized, my noise reduction grommet rings fits nicely.  I will also be adding a few weights to help it fall seamlessly.  I love these drapes, they are a great value for such quality.

These are fantastic and affordable black out curtains. I was hesitant of buying white blackout curtains online, as some claim to be blackout but aren‚Äôt. These arrived and exceeded my expectations. The quality is definitely there in these curtains. They are nice and thick, and have a good weight to them. The front of the panels, the material is soft with a satiny look that looks expensive and high quality. The backing is silvery and really does a good job at not only knocking out unwanted light, but minimizes the heat and or cold off the windows, allowing for a more even temp in my daughter‚Äôs room. They tie back easily for light access so you aren‚Äôt stuck being left in the dark if you don‚Äôt want to be. They fit my window perfectly and we couldn‚Äôt be happier.

These blackout curtains are made of great quality materials. You can tell it the minute you take them out of the Amazon shipping box. The weight tells you have received some heavy duty curtains. They are true to color as you can see in the pics. Notice for little wrinkles straight out of the packaging. Cool! One of the things I like the most about these curtains is the fact the length of the curtains match each other! Yay! I don't think I am the only one to have ordered curtains, put them up, just to find of the 2 curtains, 1 is shorter than the other. Amazon has always been great on solving that problem for me. But, it is, also nice to get curtains in like these that I do not have fold back up for sending back for an exchange! Yay, again! I do recommend these curtains! I hope this helps! God is good! All of the time!

These blackout curtains are great. Was looking for a particular height product and these came out perfectly. They are a thicker material which was great to see off the first inspection. I love the metal grommets as they will fit p just about any curtain rod and the side very easily.They blackout just as I‚Äôd hoped. Provide exact needed privacy when needed as well! Great value for the price!

If you work nights and need a dark room during the day, these are perfect! They are great quality and look fancy hanging up. They really block out the light and are easy to install.

I was very surprised when I opened up these curtains. They are very well made and heavy duty for sure. They absolutely block out light which is nice for a bedroom but look stylish as well. Great purchase and very happy with this product!!

Soon as I opened the I knew these cutains were going to be heavy. I ordered them for my bathroom. I didnt neccessarily need them for black out but I got them to help keep the cold air out during the winter months (as the windows are old and drafty) The are plain and simply, just what I was looking for. There are some creases from being folded in the package but I am sure it will go away over time since they have been hung.

These curtains do an excellent job of blocking light! I still need to hang them but tested them by holding them up to a small window during the day and by shining a high powered flashlight through them at night to illustrate their blackout ability in a photo. I was worried that white curtains would never be able to black out sunlight but these do a great job! I also like that the lining of the drapes is not completely black but instead has a white mesh over the top so they appear gray. These are a great value for 2 curtains and I will likely purchase more pairs for our other bedrooms.

Idk, visually they leave something to be desired. Plain, nothing special or fancy. May be just me. They are just as pictured so likely just me. They do block out the light well though. I even did the flashlight test as shown in the listing and i couldnt see any light. They also do a good job blocking the chill coming from the window directly next to my desk. They are heavy so hopefully my rod holds them over time. Worth the price.

Item arrived timely and as described. This is a great set of heavy duty black out curtains that can be used for a number of things. Covering windows, black out a door space or small closet, or wherever you need. It does block out the sunlight perfect!

Love these light blocking curtains! Work really well at blocking out the light. Not to thick but the material is nice and the feel and the design looks great .Easy to clean, dry, and install; these are great bedroom curtains!

The best blackout curtains I have ever come across. Very impressive for sure!! Nice quality and definitely worth the money!!!

love these. They just brighten up the room. they keep the sun out for the most part.

We would purchase again.

When first taken from the package the tablecloth had strong creases, not surprisingly. I first tried putting it in the dryer with a wet towel to relax the creases, but that didn't work. Then I did a short wash cycle followed by drying. The picture shows the tablecloth taken from the dryer while it was still running and immediately put on a table. It still has fold creases (though they aren't as strong as they were at first) and now there are other wrinkles. The whole idea was tableclothes that wouldn't need ironing. My search continues.

Good for what it is. It‚Äôs waterproof so spills won‚Äôt leak through and damage table tops. Washes well. Doesn‚Äôt crease too easily. Stains lift fairly easily for the most part. Feels and looks a little cheap to me, but that‚Äôs to be expected for the price point. We have young children so it‚Äôs great to quickly throw on the table and not worry about it!

This is a very nice table cloth.  The texture is slightly rough (i.e. not smooth and not soft) so that tabletop items don't slide.  Strong material and does not stretch.  There a slight bit of thickness in the material, but  some light can pass through it.  Not anything to be concerned with - just an observation.  We have used this table cloth on many occasions and it looks very good on the table.Overall, a good tablecloth.  No complaints.  Works to our satisfaction.  Will continue to use.

My table is square and about 52" x 52" so I got the 60" size as I want to have a nice drape over the edges.  It is a nice color, and nice size as you can see in the pictures, I tested the water proof of it and dropped water on it and it did bead up and was easy to wipe up without it staining or making the cloth wet.  I would measure your table and get a few inches bigger as this way you get the elegant drape you see in magazines and such.  The only thing is it seemed a little thin and I put this on top of another table cloth so you can see in one of the pictures the other table cloth under it.  But I think it is because of what it is made of (not cotton) as if it was the water spilled on it would go right threw.  But taking off the other table cloth you do not notice and it looks good.  So I say this is a nice product and with all the different colors, you can have a good looking table for any occasion.

This bright yellow tablecloth livens up the breakfast nook. The fabric feels nice although it does tend to slip on top of the poly-finished table. The care label states only to wash with like colors; there almost seemed to be more spots (albeit faint) after the first wash than before it.I did not give any special treatment to the fabric before tossing it into the washer the first time. Laundering with a tumble dry did reduce the fold lines. Pretreating the fabric before a second wash still left spots afterward. Although I had hopes of a better presentation, it is not worth my time chasing the spots further as I am not preparing a formal setting. I‚Äôll live with them.Full disclosure: I ordered this DWCN Square Tablecloth through the Amazon Vine program. As a user of the product, I have done my best to provide an honest review.

This tablecloth fulfills all of its promises -- well-stitched, soft to the touch, smooth draping, easy cleaning, etc.However, it's also thinner than average to the point of being slightly transparent; if a person were standing on the other side, you could see more than just a silhouette. That's acceptable for the low price, but it does skew the color aesthetic if it's light fabric on a dark table or vice versa.

Added this tablecloth to our outdoor table we use often year round. The navy blue matches the decor perfectly and I love I can wash as needed! The material is nice but on the thin side. You can see through it but I don't mind since its on a very casual outdoor table.

The table cloth is a vibrant yellow and reminds of the sunshine. It was delivered in it's clear plastic bag only, which did allow a little dirt to sneak in and make a first spot. But a little Dawn and scrubbing and there was no sign of anything. The table cloth is stain resistant and came with the described sizing. The edges are well-sewn. The cloth is a usual weave (nothing special or bad), has a medium thickness, and gives a slightly coated impression...which is fine. I can't say that it's really wrinkle resistant. It doesn't easily wrinkle but it isn't wrinkleless either.It's a lovely tablecloth with a cheerful color, and we're enjoying it.

The DWCN Rectangle Tablecloth is perfect for any setting. At 60 x 84 inches, it fits my table beautifully. It's waterproof and resistant to stains and wrinkles, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. Plus, it's machine washable, which is a huge plus. The black color adds a touch of elegance to my dining area. Highly recommend for anyone in need of a reliable table cover.

For the size and price i expected a ultra thin material, but it is well made.

I have been on the lookout for a nice tablecloth for a few months now, so I was thrilled when I found this one!  Our Walmart only sells tablecloths with patterns on it, and I really wanted something solid for two reasons.First, since we homeschool and I love educational environments, I wanted to make our meal times a little more interesting by giving some of our posters some new life by displaying them on the table during meal times.  With this black tablecloth and a clear plastic sheet I got at the fabric section at Walmart for $10, I've got the perfect set-up for displaying our posters!  And it's really easy to switch them out without harming the posters or our walls.  At first it felt kind of weird washing over them with a wet cloth or watching spills happen to them, but I got used to it, they're protected.The other thing I wanted a solid tablecloth for was so I could have a nice backdrop for pictures of things that I review.  The checkered picnic-looking table cloth I had just wasn't doing it for me.  It has made my pictures look so much better.The tablecloth did come with a few creases in it, and all I did was get it a bit wet and throw it in the dryer for a few minutes and it came out looking great.  It washes great and has met my needs perfectly.  I love it!  I plan on buying a few more as the seasonal urge hits.  Red for Christmas, green for St. Patrick's Day, etc.  At this price for this quality, I can afford to shake things up.  Black is great for Halloween, so that's what was on my radar first.

There is nothing not to like on this tablecloth.  It is thick.  Waterproof, stain-proof, and washable.  It has been on the table for a few weeks, and seems to be wearing just fine.  This might be the only kind of table cloth I buy from now on.

Judith grabbed this two pack to use for covering a large table during a yard sale, but they didn't quite arrive in time. No problem! we found plenty of other things for them - We used one for a projector screen with the grand boys to watch CARS! We have a high peaked ceiling and we hung it right in between the kitchen and living room. Mommy and Mamaw were making pizzas, and the boys loved it! We use the other one for covering the kitchen island to make it look fancy if we are having family over for a dinner - we can still sit outside on the deck, but no gnats in the food! We also have them in case we decide to have a big dinner with friends. These are nicely made, the fabric is beautiful and we are using our imaginations!

This is a nice, quality tablecloth. It looks sharp and spills on it clean up well. The sizing is accurate.  The quality of the fabric looks like it will hold up well.  I highly recommend this tablecloth.

I got this to use more as a backdrop for product videos. It is a nice fabric vs vinyl which is nice. The tablecloth comes folded so it will have square creases. I had to heat press them out since washing/drying didn't really help. So not sure what the meant by it being "wrinkle resistant" but nonetheless it all worked out and I'm happy with  the item.

This waterproof simple poly tablecloth is just as described. The stitching is simple and fabric is just like any other banquet table cloth you've ever seen. I use these for our workshops for our food and welcome bag tables because they are durable and easy to clean and you don't usually need to iron them after transport.These are nice to have for a meeting, party, or even for a Halloween trick or treat gathering. For nine bills, you can't beat that! I like the black color because adds a touch of elegance to any setting and it surprisingly doesn't show the dirt or spills easily.

Very nice tablecloth.  I ordered the Burgundy 60x60. I'm sorry I forgot to take a pic before I put my stuff back on-I was so pleased with the tablecloth! The fabric is rich in color and has a nice texture. As you can see water beads and wipes off leaving dry-not sure for huge spills, but those little ones for sure. My table measures 60" long and this covers end to end and just over each edge. The width is 48" and you can see the overhang in the pic. You will be pleased with this tablecloth.

I ordered these to go on long folding tables for an outdoor wedding. They seem to fit perfect. They are made of cloth, which I am happy about. I didn't think a plastic table cloth would be appropriate for a wedding. I do recommend washing the tablecloths before you use them, they have a little bit of an odor.

I love this yellow tablecloth! It's been a lifesaver with my toddler around.Pros:Stain Resistant: Spills wipe off easily.Durable: Survives my toddler's messes.Vibrant Color: Brightens up the room.Easy to Clean: Machine washable.Cons:Material: A little stiff at first but softens up.Overall, it‚Äôs great for families with little ones!

This table cloth is almost the same color as the pictures. It may be slightly more green.The material feels soft, and the size looks correct.It shipped quickly.

These table cloths are easy to use. They are great for any occasion. They fit many different size tables. They are easy to set up as well.

Love this tablecloth! Waterproof, stain-resistant, and wrinkle-resistant - it's a lifesaver for family dinners and parties. Easy to clean and maintain, and looks great too. Durable and well-made, worth every penny.Pros:- Easy cleanup- Looks great- DurableCons: None! Highly recommend.

Everything you read in the description is the truth. I couldn't be happier with these tablecloths.

Great material. Fit table perfectly and looks very nice. Definitely easy to clean, my kids already had me test out thay part. Overall love

These tablecloths are waterproof and stain-resistant. Easy to wash and maintain. They look nice and fit well on large tables. Good for both indoor and outdoor use. Keeps tables clean and tidy.

This table cloth fit my table well. It sits on it nicely and looks nice. The cloth is food quality and lightweight. It's easy to clean off. The cloth is a good value.

Wanted a stain and water resistant table cloth and this product worked surprisingly well.  The material seems strong and the edges are well sewn together.  I also like the scratch and heat resistance ability.  The feel of the material is good. Would recommend this product.

I really hate giving bad reviews but this is the worst pot sets I‚Äôve ever bought, the  coating is not good and it‚Äôs not easy to clean the handle doesn‚Äôt stay in place easy to burn the a appearance are beautiful other than that this is a 1 star for me.

There is some black gunk at the bottom that is probably toxic but also stains everything. This morning even the inside was stained. Don‚Äôt purchase this item - invest in a better quality product.

the bottom of these pots will come out of the dishwasher with black stuff alll over the bottom mind you before being put in dishwasher they where also stubbed. it leaves stains everywhere on the pots and lids

This set is absolutely incredible.  I just purchased an Rv and needed a lightweight sturdy set. This fits the bill. Very well made,lightweight & stackable. It comes with felt liners & measuring cups. The handles are also detachable. Perfect for dorm living,apartments or RV.

Got this set and am so happy with them. I'm not the only one obsessed with them in my house either. My fiance loves them too and says he wants a back up set since we constantly cook for 8 people. They take up so little space and heat up so quickly and are actually non stick. I have had so many problems with food stuck on "non-stick" pans but there's no stick at all. The food cooks faster. Plus as mentioned above we have 6 kids so it's so nice to take the handle off to make sure it's not getting knocked down and burning anyone. These are amazing!!!!

Love these pans easy to remove handle goes from oven to stove top and back with ease. Truly nonstick! Quality topnotch but the cream does brown up a bit after use

I dont normally order pots and pans off a website but i seen these on here and decided lets give these a try. I got to say I LOVE THESE, they are amazing clean up is easy nonstick and look amazing. And with small children running around u dont need to worry bout them hitting the handle and it falling on them cause u can remove the handle. Ive told my family and friends bout these. Id order again for gifts to friends.

Having a versatile cookware set can make all the difference in the kitchen. That's why I decided to try the JEETEE Pots and Pans Set, a 26-piece collection with a detachable handle for space-saving storage. Here's what my experience has been like:Stackable Smarts: The detachable handle is the real star of this set. It allows you to remove the handle from the pots and pans, making them incredibly stackable. This is a game-changer for small kitchens or anyone who wants to maximize cabinet space.Stovetop Versatility: The set is advertised to work on various stovetops, including gas, electric, and induction. This versatility is a major plus, meaning you won't have to worry about compatibility issues no matter what kind of stove you have.Oven-Safe Options: Several pieces in the set, including the saucepans and the casserole dish, are oven-safe up to 350¬∞F. This allows you to seamlessly transition from stovetop cooking to baking or finishing a dish in the oven, all within the same pan.Non-Stick Appeal: The pans feature a non-stick coating, which makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. Food slides right off, minimizing the need for excess oil and making post-meal cleanup a snap.A Word on Size: The online description didn't mention the specific sizes of each pot and pan. While it seems like a comprehensive set, knowing the sizes beforehand would be helpful to ensure you're getting the pieces you'll use most often.A Peek at Quality: While the set seems well-made overall, some user reviews mentioned concerns about the long-term durability of the non-stick coating and the handles. Reading a wider range of reviews might be helpful before you buy.Overall: The JEETEE Pots and Pans Set (26 pcs) offers a space-saving design with its detachable handle and a good variety of pieces for everyday cooking. The non-stick coating and oven-safe functionality add to its convenience. However, the lack of size information and some questions about long-term quality are worth considering. If you have limited cabinet space and prioritize space-saving features, this set could be a good option, but reading more reviews might be helpful to get a better sense of its durability.

They came exactly as expected and work amazingly. I did a dish that required stovetop and oven cooking for which I normally would use two different pans and this time it only took one. I would buy them again.

I bought this set due to the price point and reviews. A couple of pans came with small scratches. I disregarded it and attributed it to production/ the packaging process. The first pan I cooked with was the griddle style pan and it was also the one I noticed having small scratches. No matter how many times I washed it before use it had a weird film/ coating. When cooking with the pan it produces a lot of black soot as if the pan is unable to tolerate the heat from the stovetop. After cooking the pan remained stained after washing it and still maintained that weird film with spots indicating the pan was burnt.This is not a good set. It doesn‚Äôt seem safe. I will be returning these or trashing them.

Received this product, looks great but did not include the fridge storage lids which were a large selling point for this specific product.

I love the concept and easy storage. These work well for sauces, soups, pasta, etc but the frying pan discolored from browning thin pork chops and the grill pan could not stand up to hotdogs and hamburgers.  By the looks of the pans you would have thought the food was burned.

These pots are very light. The handles can be attached and detached . everything came disassembled and had to be assembled, which didn't take long. These are not dishwasher safe.  do not dry heat or it can warp the product . These have to be washed with soap and water by hand .you cannot use metal utensils with this it will scrape off the coating. so these are very delicate pots and requires assembly every time you use it. you cannot just pick this up without a handle. you have to attach the handle and detach when you want to switch pots each time. So this is a hassle. Pots do retain heat. And cool down is normal.I just don't like the fact that I have the reassemble and disassemble each time I switch pots.

They stained from the first use. I like the size and the handles

Since the handle comes off of these Pots and Pans they take up less room and are easier to store.  I also like that these can go from stovetop to oven making it easier to make some dishes.  I don't like to use silicone against food stuff so I won't use the utensils that come with the set.  So far I think the pots and pans are nice but I don't use it much.

They are lightweight, they cook very well, and evenly at that.They are easy to clean.They look good.They work on induction ranges.They take alot of heat, and keep on cooking.They stack well.Love the protective insert, so they do not scuff each other up when storing (this is a winner in all of itself).The hand are brilliant, but they are a little loos, not like fall off or drop loose, but wiggly.I love the set, they look good in the kitchen, they cook great, and they store well!!!A must have set, especially if you have a small or large kitchen!Highly recommend!

Quality elegant and easy to clean

These are great! Even heat, easy to clean and no scratches!

Good

I don‚Äôt as a rule wright reviews but could not sit back and not.These are the best pans I‚Äôve ever owned. Love that they stack up nicely, and store away without taken up a lot of room, easy to clean up and since the handles are detachable no more food stuck around that area.The look and design is spot on.I also like that you get an even heat cook across the pan.I will be buying another set in the future.

Theses pots and pans are excellent quality. They are very lightweight and take up a lot less space. The handle bing removable is great! Nothing sticks to them, so they are very easy to clean. I'm so happy with this set I wish I had gotten them sooner. They are the best pots and pan I've ever owned!

I recently purchased the JEETEE Pots and Pans Set Non Stick 26pcs, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This cookware set offers a wide range of pots and pans that are not only non-stick but also come with a unique feature - removable handles.One of the standout features of this cookware set is the removable handle. This innovative design allows for easy storage and stacking of the pots and pans. The handles securely attach to each piece, providing a sturdy grip while cooking. I found this feature particularly useful when it came time to clean and store the set, as it saved valuable cabinet space.The non-stick surface of the pots and pans is excellent. I have used various cooking techniques, from frying to saut√©ing, and the food easily releases from the surface without sticking. This makes cooking and cleaning up a breeze. I also appreciate that the non-stick coating is PFOA-free, ensuring that I can cook with peace of mind.The set includes a wide variety of pots and pans, offering versatility in the kitchen. From saucepans to frying pans, and even a stockpot, I found that I had all the necessary cookware to prepare a wide range of meals. The sizes are practical and accommodate different cooking needs.Another great feature of this cookware set is its compatibility with induction cooktops. The pots and pans heat up quickly and evenly, allowing for efficient cooking. They are also oven safe, which adds to their versatility in the kitchen.The beige color of the cookware set is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to my kitchen. The color is consistent throughout the set, and it has maintained its appearance even after multiple uses and washes. The set is also dishwasher safe, making clean-up even easier.In terms of durability, I have been using this cookware set for a few months now, and it has held up well. The pots and pans are sturdy and feel solid in hand.

The beige color adds a touch of elegance to the kitchen, and the durability of the set ensures long-lasting use. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced cook, this cookware set is a great investment for your kitchen.

I had tons of cookware.  Some teflon, some copper coated and all scratched and peeling.  Most have lost their non-stick already.  Decided on this set, because it doesn't take that much space.  It brings 2 handles which I can move from pot to pot.  That makes it easier to stack and store.  So far it has being nice and easy to cook with them, and nothing sticks.It brings some silicon utensils, very handy.  Coordinated colors too.  Also, it brings some separators to avoid scratches.TIP: do not use, harsh sponges to clean them, a normal one will do, and do not cook at high, to prevent burn-outs.  This type of cookware thrives in medium heat. Also clean spills quickly to avoid having to scour your pots, they are very nice and you will want them for a long time.

nice sized  set of cookware, easy to clean, and not had any issues with sticking, for the size of the set and the cost it is hard to beat

This set of non-stick pots and pans is amazing. It‚Äôs super elegant looking in light cream color.  I love how easy it is to clean. Storage is as compact as it can possibly get because of two removable handles that fit each pot and pan. I wish there was an option to buy extra handles of this color. Pots and pans are made out of aluminum alloy with non-stick marble stone coating. They claim to be PFOA free which is super important to me. Lids are made of tempered glass tid and silicone. This 26 pieces set includes 18 cm saucepan with lid, 20 cm saucepan with lid, 20 cm frying pan, 26 cm frying pan, 26 cm Saut√©-Pan with lid and 26 cm grill pan, 4 cooking utensils, 6 fridge storage lids and pot protectors for storage( to not scratch each other). I cooked in almost all of them so far and they are excellent in usage and easy to clean and store. I highly recommend this set.

These pans are so great! My favorite part is that they don't take up much room. The handle is easy to put on and take off, and the pans seem pretty sturdy.

This pond set is so beautiful. The detachable arms are so cool. They only come with two but that‚Äôs OK. It‚Äôs not a big hassle. Not sure why anyone else would be complaining. It‚Äôs literally gonna take you two seconds to move one handle to the other and when will you really need to use all of these all at once and again, it takes two seconds, even if you have to use them all at once to detach the handle and reattach it. It‚Äôs a click of a button, just a right amount of weight to it. Comes with everything you need you utensils and covers. Nice rubber handles and rubber edges on the cover. The grip of the handle is also very nice. The button is not in a place where your hand may accidentally push it and detached the handle. You‚Äôd have to be very careless for your hands to be all the way up there to detach the handle Accidentally . definitely recommend it, of course use the utensils that come with it do not use metal utensils..

Oh my lord, I love these pans! They are so light and easy to clean. Not dishwasher safe which stinks but for ease of use I will hand wash them! The handles come off with the press of a button and everything stacks inside the other in ONE STACK! I have SO MUCH cabinet space now! The color is a nice off-cream white and the lids are kinda cool too. They are silicone and glass with little cutouts for the handle and a steam vent too so stuff doesn't get too pressurized. 100% Recommend these pots and pans!

Very pleased with the pots and pans!  Super light and very nicely made.  It is great that they nest together which makes it very nice for storage.  They are nice to use on both gas and electric stove tops and oven (without the lid)!  They clean very nicely-- and recommended not for dishwasher-- but hand wash and not to use anything that make scratch the surface of the pots and pans.They come with 2 detachable handles and refrigerator protector storage lids.  Great for someone getting a start-- college student-- I am super pleased with the set!

The cookware set has been a hit with everyone in our household, proving to be incredibly practical. I love how neatly stackable they are, saving a significant amount of space in our cabinets. The removable handles provide flexibility, allowing seamless transitions from stove to oven to table. Plus, the non-stick coating makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. Overall, it's a fantastic addition to our kitchen.....

Great set with plenty of sizes for my needs. I love the detachable handle. This is the first time I have tried cookware with a detachable handle so I was a bit hesitant at first, but they snap on tightly and don't feel flimsy at all when cooking.These things are SUPER EASY to store, even in small spaces. I use these in an RV with limited storage options and they are perfect.Definitely a fan! Would recommend this set for anyone that wants a nice selection of pots and pans without needing a huge amount of space to hang or store it all.

these pots and pans have saved so much space in my cabinets and I LOVE the removable handle feature. it makes cleaning them and storing them SO MUCH EASIER!!!

I have been a little hesitant about pots and pans that have the clippable handles.These assuaged all my fears and hesitations.They work perfectly.They are well made, and lightweight. The ceramic coating is thick and works really well.The pans seem really durable.They sit nice and flat on the stove without the handle weight down one end as well.The storage is nice and you can make much more room in your cabinets with these also.They come with lids and silicone covers for left overs and multiple cooking utensils.I really recommend these for the home cook!

I love how they look.  I appreciate the care taken in packaging them for shipping.  They appear sturdy and I anticipate them lasting though many family dinners.  They do not have any of the potentially harmful chemicals that are found in lesser cookwares.So far I have had a positive experience with them and their ease of cleaning. The matching utensils are a nice touch and help me feel like I have a more professional kitchen

I suppose it's because of the non-stick coating's effectiveness - even when just using the pot (without handle) as a large bowl for food - without cooking - it's the easiest kitchenware I've ever experienced so far as cleaning food residue! It just comes right off, without any force needed.Very cool set if you're space-limited, such as a mobile home or a cramped apartment, need to be able to pack up your things and move often. In that case, just stow it in the box it came in, in the same stacked way, and it's incredible how small of a box this stuff can fit within.Material seems to be good quality and durable so far as I can tell at this early point in ownership. Recommended!

This pot and pan set is fantastic! The handles make it super nice to remove from the oven when heated. Very light weight and stack well together. If you are tight on space this is the set for you. I like having the refrigerator lids too for storage.

I'm so excited to have this set! First off, they are a beautiful color! I LOVE the DEEP wells the frying pans offer! Less risk of accidentally sending food flaying about because of aggressive stirring. I can do so many more things with this set including enjoying the removable handles and using the pans as serving pots if needed.

Theses pots and pans has detachable handles and they are oven safe. You can stack them up after each use to help you save space. You can cook and then serve in them. They are oven safe and made of non stick material.

... is a couple more stars for me to tap on!  These not only look flat out beautiful. They are. One average size drawer and they will fit. Stacks and fits easily. Live in tiny house? Perfect. Single or a Couple you bet.Even the tools are the perfect size. Example the spatula is just right. I don't need another one big enough to flip a pizza. This stuff... all of it is the perfect size and priced way below what I would have ever thought.Even the lids and handle technology and design is beautful. As to cooking. I've given the small frypan and lid some testing. Results... 7 stars. I'm very careful and take good care of all my stuff I like therefore if this holds up I may give it a pedestal and glass display case to show it off. OK, I won't go to that extreme but I've already been showing it off!!

This set comes with removable handles, which means you don't need as much space to store them. I love their nonstick texture. This whole set gives you pretty much everything you need to cook with, including cooking utensils.

These are ideal for small spaces and are easy to stack due to the handy pot protectors, and they seem to be fairly effective at preventing scratches and chips. This set is an excellent value for the price. The handles are very easy to attach and detach, and I appreciate this feature because it makes storage easier. The set includes cooking utensils and covers, which is extremely convenient.

This is a great set of nonstick pans and includes all of the silicone utensils. The removable handles make them easy to put in smaller ovens and into dishwashers without the handles getting in the way. As you can see in the short video I attached they are really easy to clean. I just gently wiped with a dry paper towel. They heat very evenly. These are a great size for a smaller family that doesn't need large pots and pans. I really love these! They are versatile, easy to clean and take up very little space

These are perfect as a gift or for a camper or RV! They are the exact sizes you need and will use and they just wipe clean easily!

The set has everything I need for cooking. The non-stick surface is excellent, food doesn't stick, and cleaning is easy. I tried it in the oven, too. The removable handle is excellent. The beige color looks great and the complete set takes just one side of the shelve. I'm impressed with this set. It's perfect for home cooking.The best thing is, I'm Happy and recommend it!

I noticed the utensils are mismatched to the set - some white, some cream coloured. minor scuff marks were on them too.pots and pans work great over my gas stove!

Been using this for a month now, easy to store with  the removable handles. Great quality and No complaints.

These pots are amazing in every way.  Quality, stackability, storage.  I absolutely love them

I was so confused and shocked when I first saw the curtains‚Ä¶I was given just large pieces of a dark weird pink fabric WITH BURNS AND STAINS!!! I‚Äôve never been more disappointed with a purchase‚Ä¶..biggest scam ever.Don‚Äôt buy

Basically transparent. Very unstable extended fully.

These are supposed to be backdrop curtains, and they‚Äôre completely see-through so it makes it hard for them to be a backdrop when you can see through them

Excellent value

The color is great, and served as a great backdrop for our photos!

I bought 2 of these. Way better than what I have purchased previously for my back drops. Also amazing for balloon arches.

Thick quality..haven't used it yet, but looks good.

There are 2 curtain panels in my order. The product listing does state that these are background curtains, or also known as backdrop curtains, for the purpose of photography or celebrations. In my opinion, they would indeed work just fine for this purpose, as well as for social media video background curtains. They would likely even do well as a normal window curtain set. However, do know that since they come as a 2 panel set, depending on how they are hung and positioned, the seperation gap could be made visible or not visible. It's just personal preference, really.These curtains are definitely long enough to be used as a full length, or near full length, backdrop, depending on staging and user height. They also are plenty long enough to be used for the standard full size window. While other color options or bundle packages may be available at other times, my own order contained a solid and evenly applied color commonly refered to as baby blue.The fabric of these curtains is somewhat thin and slightly rough textured. The stitching is also slightly thin threaded, with thin seam margins, but otherwise still looks well done. It is for these last 2 traits that this curtain set gets 4 out of 5 stars.

The DWCN Navy Blue backdrop curtains are a set of 2 panels.  There is a rod pocket for slipping it onto the backdrop horizontal pole.  The material is polyester and does a decent job of not reflecting, but there is a slight reflection when not using fill lights.  One reason for the lower rating is that a single panel is preferable to 2 panels to eliminate the opening in the center where it is exactly centered in the photo.

I purchased 3 sets of the backdrop curtains for my display tent for my artwork. The curtains are an elegant look behind my paintings

The curtains themselves are very well made and looks very nice right out of the bag. Unfortunately, with light behind them, they are see through. I used them against a wall and they were perfect. They look gorgeous and the color is so rich. I did have to steam them a little for a more wrinkle free look. They wash well and does not shrink.

Wonderfull backdrop for photos and even videos. It is not pure white which is great for me. Good quality fabric too

The material is made of good quality fabric. The color is very vibrant seems to be very durable. Exactly as described It‚Äôs very long 10 x 10.

I couldn't be happier with the DWCN 10x10 FT Ivory Backdrop Curtain! It was the perfect addition to my party decor. The rod pockets made setup a breeze, and the ivory color added a touch of elegance to the ambiance. It was a hit with my guests, and it looked fantastic in all the photos. Highly recommend for anyone looking to elevate their event decorations

This backdrop is made of a very soft and light material is a great neutral backdrop. The two panels are great for varies ways to decorate it.

This backdrop is pretty nice as far as richness of color, for the size of it, for the price, and for the finishing. It's all finished nicely, no loose threads or snags. It's cut perfectly and fits on my backdrop stand as well as all my other curtains.For an outside event, the sun will shine through, unless you've got a white or nude backdrop behind it to give it some opacity while still preserving the turquoise color. It's such a pretty color. I use backdrops for indoor events a LOT, so I know that this will need some backing fabric or to be against a solid wall to really make this color pop like I want it to. It is best for indoors.The fabric is more of medium weight, but on the lighter side. It's hard to describe for me, sorry.I think that the price is fair for such a massive backdrop in such a bright color. It is good quality and I'm sure that I'll be using it for years. I like the zip bag included. It's just clear plastic, but it'll help me keep this organized and visible, as well as clean.

love this backdrop curtain. it is sleek, feels velvety and somewhat thick-its just the right amount of thick actually. and it is not see-through. its perfect. it looks great for photos or making videos! easy to use, folds up nicely into a small square if i need it to so its convenient to store or move around and take along with you. i have zero complaints honestly and the price is right in my opinon. id recommend it.

.Quality fabric with a luxurious feel. The stitching is adequate and strong. The best part is the rod pockets.There are theatrical applications as well as photo backdrop. Comes out wrinkle free after storage. Nice value too.

Great back drop when you want to add some colors to your portrait to amplify skin tones.  Works well.  Recommended.

A photographer needs a variety of backdrop colors to fit any situation.  This very nicely fills the void I had in the bright pink area! My daughter loves the color.

Quality, thick backdrop panels are easy to use. The pale blue color is great for baby showers, weddings, family photos, the list goes on.  Add a dash of clash to your photo booth.

This curtain makes a wonderful backdrop. It is heavy enough to hang steadily but not heavy enough to be hard to handle or make the rod droop. The fabric itself is tight and not light-emitting, exactly as needed for photography use. This is an excellent curtain, well made, easy to iron and hang!

This backdrop arrived quickly in good condition. The color represented is accurate - in my case I chose the Navy Blue. The tailoring is good and material is perfect for a backdrop... nice sheen and texture. This product is a good value, IMHO - and I believe you'll be very satisfied with your selection. Five stars!

Of course at Under $30, at the time of this review, I was expecting them to be a bit Shear and not heavy duty. I was not expecting them to have this nice weight and to hang so well though. I was surprised and pleased with this. I'm happy to have them now and do recommend them.

This is very nice fabric and will make a great backdrop for photos.  The fabric is thick enough, but not so thick as to be heavy. The hems are nicely sewn and the material is washable.  I really like the pocket at the top for the rod; no more clipping fabric to the rod!

This is beautiful fabric! It is substantial, with a dense weave that drapes nicely on my stand. It is soft white, not off-white with a yellow undertone, which works well for portraits. Dress it up with any kind of accessories, like balloons or flowers, or keep it simple it is ideal for a photographer. Highly recommended.

Good quality curtains. They can be used as a background for photography, or as curtains. Good quality fabric and very nice delicate color.

Great quality and so easy to use.  Such a great neutral backdrop for photographs.

These are a simple, affordable solution for quick and easy panels for our uses. We use them for background curtains at our puppet shows. They are lightweight and easy to transport. They are pretty see-through if there‚Äôs light behind them but I knew that when ordering them.I recommend.

This backdrop curtain is made with quality fabric, medium to heavy weight so it drapes nicely.  It feels like a nice tablecloth type of fabric. The soft pink color is beautiful. Really would be nice as a window drape as well IMO.

Durable, soft material, looks great.

I'll be using these backdrop curtains at a wedding.  They are simply gorgeous.  This fabric is the perfect weight to drape well and the perfect material to avoid wrinkles.  You do not need to iron or steam these.  They are opaque, so nothing on the other side will be visible.  I think the ivory I received is beautiful and going to be perfect for the photos.

Nice & opaque. Thick material, feels nice. Drapes perfectly. Washes well.

This is exactly what I needed and wanted. The color is the exact same as picture. It was long enough for my ten foot backdrop pole. This is what you need!!!
